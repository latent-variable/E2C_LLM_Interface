大思政课丨红色文旅实践如何赋能“大思政课”建设 来源：人民论坛网 作者：龚曦 罗俊祺 责任编辑：于海洋 2023-02-01 17:57:53 0,进入新时代以来，满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要，建设美丽中国，已经成为时代发展的主旋律。在物质条件不断得到满足的基础上，对“美”的追求已经是一种更深层次的内在需求。2018年9月，习近平总书记在全国教育大会上强调：“要全面加强和改进学校美育，坚持以美育人、以文化人，提高学生审美和人文素养。”美育和思想政治教育都在落实立德树人根本任务中发挥着重要作用。旅游从本质上说是一种审美活动。旅游体验正是能够提升个体欣赏美、体验美和创造美能力的活动，其本质是美育的升华和展现。 近年来，多元化、趣味性的呈现方式让红色文旅有了新的“打开方式”。红色旅游已经成为年轻人了解革命历史、缅怀革命先烈、传承红色基因的重要方式。湖南师范大学结合旅游学科专业特色，以红色文旅实践为依托，紧密联动“思政小课堂”与“社会大课堂”，开展了一系列以红色美育为主旨的“大思政课”教育实践活动，带领学生深入红色资源景区挖掘红色革命故事，将红色故事与时代主旋律相结合，创作了一系列红色文旅美育作品，实现了教师主导与学生主体的良性互动、理论阐释与实践探索的互融互通、教育内容与教育形式的双向建构，探索了“感知凝聚——诠释赋意——内化认同”具象化红色美育“大思政课”的建设路径，切实用好红色资源，讲好红色故事，搞好红色教育。 感知凝聚，助推红色文旅实践见行见效 美育是审美教育，具有形象直观、生动活泼的特点，注重从“美”的感性层面浸润学生心灵。今天的湖湘大地，遍布着革命先烈的红色足迹，宛若一座没有围墙的革命历史博物馆，其传递出来的强烈的精神内核和情感特质代表着红色精神的实质，从而产生深厚的美育价值，具有很大的理论价值和现实意义。 湖南师范大学充分发挥国家级一流本科建设点优势，组织学生前往伟人故里韶山、“半条被子”故事发生地汝城沙洲村、将军故里平江、黄埔分校旧址武冈、红军长征湖南段等一批红色景区开展红色文旅调研实践，深入挖掘地方红色故事与红色精神，借助旅游场域中丰富多元的审美体验，感知红色故事场景，凝聚红色故事认同，鼓励学生从中感受自然美、文化美和艺术美，从形式美育走向实质美育，推动红色文旅美育见行见效。 诠释赋意，绘声绘色妙用可视化党史故事 “大思政课”之大，旨在体现协同效应，要实现“教”与“学”的双向互动、“道”与“器”的相互配合、“知”与“行”的有机统一。湖南师范大学将红色旅游与美育培育连接起来，注重挖掘艺术教育侧重培养学生的创造能力与感性思维的优势，一方面建有《“红色筑梦之旅”创意设计与实践》专思创精品课程，联通《从创意到创业》《红色旅游景区促销运营虚拟仿真实验》《酒店品牌建设与管理》等一批国家级、省级金课，形成“课程思政”群，开创“专业+思政+美学艺术”课程新模式，如通过红色旅游实践，引导学生共同创作可视化红色故事，用学生喜闻乐见的Vlog、H5、短视频等方式予以呈现。同时引导学生将学思践悟成效转化成红色文创设计、红色研学旅游路线开发等，在专业教学实践中讲好中华优秀传统文化、革命文化，尤其设计创作了《萝卜眼里长铜钱》《毛毯里的军民情》《赓续湘女魂》等一批可视、可爱、可亲的系列红色漫画作品，让红色故事“飞入寻常百姓家”。另一方面，学生在美育作品创作的过程中，进一步对革命故事、红色故事进行复盘，切实感知了解故事、事迹及其背后蕴含的精神价值，促进学生心灵与红色文化的沟通和交流，认同“实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦”这一主题主线，从青年群体的视角予以新时代的诠释与赋意，由此，学生在审美体验、环境熏陶、自我探索中习得美育知识、升华美育情感、提升审美能力、塑造健康人格。 内化认同，推动新时代党的创新理论入脑入心 所谓“以美培元”，就是通过美育培育学生非功利性审美，知行合一践行社会主义核心价值观，以期发挥好美育对丰富德育、增进智育、促进体育、改善劳育的重要作用。“思政课的本质是讲道理”。美育虽为隐性教育，但同样是情感升华、心智开启、性情养育的体验过程，两者融合互通，将抽象的理论具体化、生动化，提升思想政治教育实效，不断构建思政课高质量发展“大格局”。 湖南师范大学通过“美育+思政”方式着力培养创新人才，学生不仅自身在红色美育创作中提升理论修养，增进对新时代党的创新理论的认同感、亲近感，同时身体力行宣传推广，带动师生党员、团员青年志愿者进乡村、进社区、进田间、进学校，着力开展“四史”教育，涌现出了一批全国暑期社会实践优秀个人、中国大学生自强之星、湖南省优秀共青团员等学生典型，凝练的成果荣获第六届全国高校“礼敬中华优秀传统文化”特色展示项目、第六届中国青年志愿服务项目大赛银奖、入选2022年文化和旅游志愿服务典型案例等。更有一批红色文旅实践志愿者毕业后选择奔赴西藏、新疆，扎根湖南省偏远地区基层一线奉献青春，真正实现与“社会大课堂”结合起来。推进红色美育实践的课程思政群建设“立意高”、“格局大”，造就拔尖创新人才和服务区域经济社会发展，切实发挥了“大思政课”铸魂育人的作用。（作者：湖南师范大学 龚曦 罗俊祺） 【本文系2022年湖南省社会科学成果评审委员会课题《运用红色美育资源深化高校党史学习教育成效研究》(项目编号:XSP22YBC524) 、2021年湖南师范大学党建研究专项课题《基于红色美育的大学生党员培养教育创新研究》（编号20211220GX）阶段性研究成果】,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208191446/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215929.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208060927/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215929.html,2023-02-09 0:00:00,"How the practice of red cultural tourism empowers the construction of ""big ideological and political class"" Source: People's Tribune Author: Gong Xi Luo Junqi Editor in Chief: Yu Haiyang 2023-02-01 17:57:53 0","Since entering the new era, meeting the people's growing needs for a better life and building a beautiful China have become the main theme of the times. On the basis of the continuous satisfaction of material conditions, the pursuit of ""beauty"" has become a deeper intrinsic demand.In September 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized at the National Education Conference that ""we should comprehensively strengthen and improve aesthetic education in schools, insist on educating people with beauty and culture, and improve students' aesthetic and humanistic literacy. aesthetic and humanistic literacy."" Both aesthetic education and ideological and political education play an important role in the implementation of the fundamental task of establishing morality. Tourism is essentially an aesthetic activity. Tourism experience is precisely the activity that can enhance the individual's ability to appreciate beauty, experience beauty and create beauty, and its essence is the sublimation and presentation of aesthetic education. In recent years, diversified and interesting presentation methods have given red cultural tourism a new ""open way"". Red tourism has become an important way for young people to understand revolutionary history, remember revolutionary martyrs and inherit the red gene. Hunan Normal University, combined with the professional characteristics of tourism, based on the practice of red tourism, closely linked with the ""small classroom of ideology and politics"" and ""social classroom"", carried out a series of ""big ideology and politics class"" with the main theme of red aesthetic education, and led the red tourism practice to the ""big ideology and politics class"". ""Educational and practical activities, leading students to go deep into the red resource scenic spots to excavate the red revolutionary stories, combining the red stories with the main theme of the times, and creating a series of red cultural and tourism aesthetic works, realizing the benign interaction between the teacher's leading role and the student's main role, the interplay between theoretical interpretation and practical exploration, and the bidirectional construction between educational content and educational forms, exploring the following Explore the construction of the ""big ideological and political class"" of visualizing red aesthetic education by ""perceiving cohesion--interpreting meaning--internalizing identity"". It explores the construction of ""Great Civic and Political Education"" which visualizes the red aesthetic education ""and internalizes the identity"", makes good use of the red resources, tells good red stories and improves red education. Perception of cohesion, boosting the practice of red cultural tourism to see the effect of aesthetic education is aesthetic education, with the image of intuitive, lively features, focusing on the ""beauty"" of the perceptual level of infiltration of the student's mind. Today's Hunan land is covered with the red footprints of revolutionary martyrs, just like a museum of revolutionary history without walls, and the strong spiritual core and emotional qualities it conveys represent the essence of the red spirit, thus generating a profound aesthetic value with great theoretical value and practical significance. Hunan Normal University gives full play to the advantages of national first-class undergraduate construction sites, organizing students to go to Shaoshan, the hometown of great men, Rucheng Shazhou Village, the story of ""half a quilt"", Pingjiang, the hometown of the generals, the old site of the Whampoa branch school, Wugang, the Red Army's Long March in Hunan, and a number of other red scenic areas to carry out research and practice of the red cultural and tourism research, and to deeply excavate the red stories and red spirit, with the help of tourism in the field of red stories and red spirit. Red spirit, with the help of rich and diversified aesthetic experience in the tourism field, perceive the red story scene, gather the red story identity, encourage students to feel the natural beauty, cultural beauty and artistic beauty, from the form of aesthetic education to the substance of aesthetic education, and promote the red cultural and tourism aesthetic education to see the effect of action. Interpretation of the meaning of the visualization of the party history story ""big ideological and political class"" is aimed at reflecting the synergistic effect, to achieve the ""teaching"" and ""learning"" of two-way interaction, ""Road"" and ""instrument"" of mutual cooperation, ""know"" and ""act"" of organic unity. Hunan Normal University connects red tourism with aesthetic cultivation, focusing on tapping the advantages of art education focusing on cultivating students' creativity and perceptual thinking, on the one hand, there is a """"Red Dream Building Tour"" creative design and practice"" special Si Chuang boutique course, linking the ""From Creativity to Entrepreneurship"" ""Red Tourism Scenic Spot Promotion and Operation Virtual Simulation Experiments A number of national and provincial gold courses, such as ""Hotel Brand Building and Management"", have formed a group of ""Course Civics"", and created a new mode of ""Professional + Civics + Aesthetics and Art"", such as through the practice of red tourism, guiding the students to co-create visualization of the red story, and using the Vlog which is popular among the students. For example, through the practice of red tourism, students are guided to co-create visualized red stories, which are presented in Vlog, H5, short videos and other ways that are popular among students. At the same time, students are guided to transform the results of learning, thinking, practicing and understanding into the design of red cultural creations and the development of red study tour routes, etc., and speak well of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and revolutionary culture in their professional teaching practice. In particular, they have designed and created a number of visual, lovely and relatable series of red cartoons such as ""Copper Coins Growing in Radish Eyes"", ""Military and Civilian Love in Blanket"", ""Continuation of the Xiangnian Women's Soul"" and other red cartoons, so that the red stories can be brought into common people's homes. Let the red story fly into the common people's home"". On the other hand, in the process of creation of art works, students further review the revolutionary stories and red stories, and effectively perceive and understand the stories, deeds and the spiritual values behind them, promote the communication and exchange of students' minds with the red culture, and identify with the theme of ""Realizing the Great Revival of the Chinese Dream of the Chinese Nation"", and give the new era a new perspective from the viewpoint of the youth group. From the perspective of youth groups, they are given the interpretation and meaning of the new era, so that students can acquire knowledge of aesthetic education, sublimate the emotion of aesthetic education, improve their aesthetic ability and shape a healthy personality through aesthetic experience, environmental cultivation and self-exploration. The new era of the Party's innovative theories into the heart of the so-called ""beauty cultivation"" is to cultivate non-utilitarian aesthetics through the beauty of the students, the unity of knowledge and practice of the core socialist values, in order to play a good role in the beauty of the enrichment of moral education, enhancement of the intellectual education, the promotion of physical education, and the improvement of the important role of the labor education. ""The essence of the Civics class is to reason.""

Whether there is a lack of theoretical learning, make up for the calcium of the spirit. Focus on strengthening learning, especially to strengthen political theory learning.

促进物质富足和精神富有相统一 来源：光明网-《光明日报》 作者：陈娟 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-01-31 10:46:45 0,【深入学习宣传贯彻党的二十大精神】 作者：陈娟（天津市中国特色社会主义理论体系研究中心南开大学基地研究员） 党的二十大报告指出，“中国式现代化是物质文明和精神文明相协调的现代化。物质富足、精神富有是社会主义现代化的根本要求”，并把“人的全面发展、全体人民共同富裕取得更为明显的实质性进展”列为到2035年我国发展的总体目标之一。人无精神则不立，国无精神则不强，共同富裕是人民群众物质生活和精神生活都富裕。新时代新征程上，应深刻把握共同富裕的科学内涵，不断厚植现代化的物质基础，大力发展社会主义先进文化，促进物的全面丰富和人的全面发展，实现全体人民物质富足和精神富有相统一。 物质生活和精神生活都富裕是社会主义共同富裕观的重要内容 “无产阶级的运动是绝大多数人的、为绝大多数人谋利益的独立的运动。”我国是中国共产党领导下的社会主义国家，我们党所追求的共同富裕既具有全民性，又具有全面性。全民性是指享受富裕的主体是全体人民，即共同富裕路上一个都不能掉队；全面性则是指共同富裕的内容是全方位的，既包括物质生活富裕，又包括精神生活富裕。 物质生活富裕和精神生活富裕是辩证统一的关系。物质生活需要是最基本的，只有满足了物质生活需要，才可能去追求精神生活需要。恩格斯指出：“人们首先必须吃、喝、住、穿，然后才能从事政治、科学、艺术、宗教等等。”没有相应的物质基础，精神生活就无从谈起。精神生活以物质生活为基础，一经形成便具有相对独立性和能动性。一个民族的复兴需要强大的物质力量，也需要强大的精神力量。没有先进文化的积极引领，没有人民精神世界的极大丰富，没有民族精神力量的不断增强，一个国家、一个民族不可能屹立于世界民族之林。随着时代发展形成的精神生活富裕是物质生活富裕得以持续和提升的有力保障。 物质生活和精神生活共同富裕是促进人的全面发展的重要基石，人的全面发展是物质生活和精神生活共同富裕的必然结果；物质生活和精神生活共同富裕为促进人的全面发展提供更为有利的社会条件，人的全面发展又能够极大解放物质和文化生产力，推动物质生活和精神生活共同富裕向更高阶段跃升。新时代新征程上，我们要在扎实推进全体人民物质生活和精神生活共同富裕中，实现人的全面发展。 物质富足、精神富有是社会主义现代化的根本要求 现代化是从传统农业社会向现代工业社会演进的过程。从工业革命开启以来，西方国家长期走在现代化的前沿，自诩为人类现代化的样板和标杆，并试图将现代化的西方模式强制推行给其他国家。西方现代化是一种以资本为中心的现代化，只见物不见人，造成资本对劳动的剥削，带来了社会贫富分化和物质主义的极度盛行。而中国式现代化是以人民为中心的现代化。人，本质上就是文化的人，而不是“物化”的人；是能动的、全面的人，而不是僵化的、“单向度”的人。人类不仅追求物质条件、经济指标，还要追求“幸福指数”；不仅追求自然生态的和谐，还要追求“精神生态”的和谐；不仅追求效率和公平，还要追求人际关系的和谐与精神生活的充实，追求生命的意义。追求精神生活的富裕是中国式现代化的必然要求。全面建设社会主义现代化国家，必须坚持走物质生活和精神生活共同富裕的道路。 物质贫困不是社会主义，精神贫乏也不是社会主义，社会主义现代化追求的是物质富足和精神富有的共同富裕。进入新时代，我国社会主要矛盾已经转化为人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾。人民对美好生活的需要不断提升，不仅对物质生活提出了更高的要求，而且精神生活方面的要求也日益增长。中国特色社会主义是全面发展、全面进步的社会主义，共同富裕原则贯穿中国特色社会主义事业的方方面面，不仅体现在物质层面上，还要体现在精神层面上。必须牢牢把握物质富足、精神富有这一社会主义现代化的根本要求，扎实推动物质生活富裕和精神生活富裕取得新的进展。 实现物质富足和精神富有相互融合、相互促进 习近平总书记在党的二十大报告中强调，“不断厚植现代化的物质基础，不断夯实人民幸福生活的物质条件”。实现物质文明和精神文明相协调的现代化，应加快完善社会主义市场经济体制，推动发展更平衡、更协调，进一步缩小城乡区域发展和收入分配差距。完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，着力解决我国发展中面临的难题，为更高水平的共同富裕夯实牢固基础。全面推进乡村振兴，巩固脱贫攻坚成果，促进农村农民共同富裕。 满足人民过上美好生活的新期待，必须提供丰富的精神食粮。应坚持走中国特色社会主义文化发展道路，增强文化自信自强，以社会主义核心价值观为引领，传承中华优秀传统文化，弘扬革命文化，发展社会主义先进文化，满足人民日益增长的精神文化需求，激发全民族文化创新创造活力，不断凝聚推动共同富裕的精神力量。加强公共文化事业建设，健全完善公共文化服务体系，不断满足人民群众更高质量的精神文化公共产品和服务供给。加强舆论引导，为推动共同富裕营造良好环境，激发全体人民昂扬斗志，以实际行动扎实推动共同富裕。 新时代新征程上，应统筹推进物质文明和精神文明协调发展，牢牢把握物质富足、精神富有的根本要求，谋求物质生活富裕和精神生活富裕相互融合、相互促进的发展样态。具言之，在物质文明建设的过程中，深入贯彻以人民为中心的发展思想，进一步彰显社会公平正义，保障和改善民生，增强人们对美好生活和共同富裕的精神主动和信心，以此拓展精神生活富裕新空间；在精神文明建设过程中，应做大做强文化事业和文化产业，以此开拓物质生活富裕新动能。运用系统观念，在物质文明和精神文明的相互融合中，推动物质生活和精神生活的统一协调发展，促进物的全面丰富和人的全面发展。 《光明日报》（ 2023年01月31日 06版）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208191446/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215682.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208053802/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215682.html,2023-02-09 0:00:00,Promote the unity of material abundance and spiritual wealth Source: Guangming Net - Guangming Daily Author: Chen Juan Responsibility: Huang Min 2023-01-31 10:46:45 0,"[In-depth Study, Publicity and Implementation of the Spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress] By Chen Juan (Researcher at the Nankai University Base of the Tianjin Research Center for Socialist Theory System with Chinese Characteristics) The report of the 20th CPC National Congress points out that ""Chinese-style modernization is one that harmonizes material civilization with spiritual civilization. Material abundance and spiritual wealth are the fundamental requirements of socialist modernization,"" and listed ""the comprehensive development of human beings and the common prosperity of all people to make more obvious and substantial progress"" as one of the overall goals of China's development by 2035. A person cannot stand without spirit, a country cannot be strong without spirit, and common wealth is the prosperity of both the material and spiritual life of the people. On the new journey in the new era, we should deeply grasp the scientific connotation of common prosperity, continuously cultivate the material foundation of modernization, vigorously develop advanced socialist culture, promote the comprehensive enrichment of things and the comprehensive development of people, and realize the unity of material and spiritual affluence of all people. Both material and spiritual affluence are important elements of the socialist concept of common prosperity ""The movement of the proletariat is an independent movement of the vast majority of the people and for the benefit of the vast majority of the people."" China is a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and the common prosperity pursued by our Party is both universal and comprehensive. Universal refers to the fact that the main body enjoying affluence is the entire people, i.e., no one should be left behind on the road to common prosperity; comprehensive refers to the fact that the content of common prosperity is all-encompassing, encompassing both material and spiritual affluence. The relationship between material prosperity and spiritual prosperity is dialectical and unified. The material needs of life are the most basic, and it is only after the material needs of life have been satisfied that it is possible to pursue the spiritual needs of life. Engels pointed out that ""people must first eat, drink, live and wear, and then they can engage in politics, science, art, religion and so on."" Without a corresponding material foundation, there is no way to talk about spiritual life. Spiritual life is based on material life, and once formed, it is relatively independent and dynamic. The rejuvenation of a nation requires strong material power as well as strong spiritual power. Without the active leadership of advanced culture, the great enrichment of the people's spiritual world, and the continuous enhancement of the nation's spiritual strength, it is impossible for a country or a nation to stand in the forest of the world's nations. The wealth of spiritual life that develops with the times is a powerful guarantee that the wealth of material life can be sustained and upgraded. The common affluence of material and spiritual life is an important cornerstone for the promotion of comprehensive human development, and the comprehensive development of human beings is the inevitable result of the common affluence of material and spiritual life; the common affluence of material and spiritual life provides more favorable social conditions for the promotion of the comprehensive development of human beings, and the comprehensive development of human beings is able to greatly emancipate the material and cultural productive forces, and to promote the common affluence of material and spiritual life to a higher stage. The common wealth of material and spiritual life can be promoted to a higher stage. On the new journey in the new era, we must realize comprehensive human development in solidly promoting the common prosperity of the material and spiritual lives of all people. Material abundance and spiritual wealth are the fundamental requirements of socialist modernization. Modernization is a process of evolution from a traditional agricultural society to a modern industrial society. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, Western countries have long been at the forefront of modernization, boasting that they are the models and benchmarks of human modernization and trying to impose the Western model of modernization on other countries. Western modernization is a capital-centered modernization that sees only things but not people, resulting in the exploitation of labor by capital and bringing about the polarization of society between the rich and the poor and the extreme prevalence of materialism. Chinese-style modernization, on the other hand, is a people-centered modernization. Human beings are essentially cultural beings, not ""materialistic"" beings; they are dynamic and comprehensive beings, not rigid and ""one-way"" beings. Human beings not only pursue material conditions, economic indicators, but also the pursuit of ""happiness index""; not only the pursuit of natural ecological harmony, but also the pursuit of ""spiritual ecological"" harmony; not only the pursuit of efficiency and fairness, but also the pursuit of interpersonal harmony and spiritual life, the pursuit of the meaning of life. The pursuit of the meaning of life. The pursuit of a rich spiritual life is an inevitable requirement of Chinese modernization. In order to build a modern socialist country in a comprehensive manner, we must adhere to the path of common prosperity in material and spiritual life. Material poverty is not socialism, nor is spiritual poverty; socialist modernization pursues the common prosperity of both material and spiritual affluence. Entering the new era, the main contradiction in China's society has been transformed into the contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and unbalanced and insufficient development. The people's need for a better life is constantly rising, and they not only put forward higher demands for material life, but also have growing demands in terms of spiritual life. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a socialism of all-round development and progress, and the principle of common prosperity runs through every aspect of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, not only on the material level but also on the spiritual level. We must firmly grasp the fundamental requirement of socialist modernization, which is to be materially and spiritually affluent, and solidly promote new progress in material and spiritual affluence. Realizing the mutual integration and promotion of material abundance and spiritual affluence General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized in the report of the 20th Party Congress that ""the material foundation of modernization is constantly being thickened, and the material conditions for the people's happy life are constantly being strengthened."" To realize a modernization that harmonizes material and spiritual civilization, we should accelerate the improvement of the socialist market economic system, push for more balanced and coordinated development, and further narrow the gap between urban and rural regional development and income distribution. Implementing the new development concept completely, accurately and comprehensively, we will focus on solving the difficult problems facing China's development and laying a solid foundation for a higher level of common prosperity. Comprehensively promote rural revitalization, consolidate the results of poverty eradication, and promote common prosperity for rural farmers. To meet the people's new expectations for a better life, it is necessary to provide rich spiritual food. We should adhere to the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, enhance cultural self-confidence and self-reliance, take socialist core values as the lead, pass on the excellent traditional Chinese culture, carry forward the revolutionary culture, develop the advanced socialist culture, satisfy the people's growing spiritual and cultural needs, stimulate the vitality of the whole nation's cultural innovation and creativity, and continue to unite the spiritual strength to promote common prosperity. Strengthen the construction of public cultural undertakings, improve and perfect the public cultural service system, and continuously satisfy the people's higher-quality supply of spiritual and cultural public products and services. Strengthen the guidance of public opinion, create a favorable environment for the promotion of common wealth, and inspire all the people to have a high morale and take concrete action to promote common wealth. In the new era and new journey, we should promote the coordinated development of material civilization and spiritual civilization, firmly grasp the fundamental requirement of material abundance and spiritual wealth, and seek a development pattern in which material and spiritual affluence are integrated and mutually reinforcing. Specifically, in the process of building material civilization, the people-centered development ideology should be implemented in depth to further manifest social justice, safeguard and improve people's livelihoods, and enhance people's spiritual initiative and confidence in a better life and common prosperity, thus expanding new space for spiritual affluence; while in the process of building spiritual civilization, cultural undertakings and industries should be expanded and strengthened, thus opening up new kinetic energy for material affluence. By applying a systemic concept, the integration of material civilization and spiritual civilization will promote the unified and coordinated development of material life and spiritual life, and facilitate the comprehensive enrichment of things and the comprehensive development of human beings. Guangming Daily (January 31, 2023, 06 edition)","The 20th CPC National Congress has pointed out that the pursuit of material abundance and spiritual wealth is the fundamental requirement of socialist modernization. This means that both the material and spiritual aspects of life should be developed, and common prosperity should be pursued for all people. In the new era, the main contradiction in China's society has changed to the contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and unbalanced and insufficient development. To address this, the socialist concept of common prosperity, which is comprehensive and universal, must be pursued. This includes the comprehensive development of both material and spiritual civilization, as well as the active leadership of advanced culture. Therefore, the integrated development of material and spiritual wealth is crucial."
【光明论坛·温故】知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧 来源：光明网-《光明日报》 作者：刁大明 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-01-31 10:38:52 0,作者：刁大明（中国人民大学习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究院研究员、中国人民大学当代政党研究平台研究员） 2022年11月，国家主席习近平出席亚太经合组织第二十九次领导人非正式会议，并发表题为《团结合作勇担责任 构建亚太命运共同体》的重要讲话，为亚太合作指明方向。在讲话中，习近平主席引用了中国古语“知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧”，提出建设“和平稳定”“共同富裕”“清洁美丽”“守望相助”的亚太的倡议，激荡起团结合作、共促发展的强大正能量，推动着各国携手构建亚太命运共同体，再创亚太合作新辉煌。 “知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧”，出自孔子的《论语·子罕》。其基本含义是，有智慧的人不会迷惑，仁德的人不会忧愁，勇敢的人不会畏惧。孔子意在告诫弟子与世人，要不断求索真知，减少自己的困惑；要真诚地待人如己，不为个人得失而忧愁；要勇于实践，不畏惧任何困难。其中，知与仁是中国文化传统中经常被同时提及的崇高品德。比如，《论语·也雍》中说，“知者乐水，仁者乐山”，意思是聪明人像流水一样应变，智谋层出不穷；有仁德者意志坚定如山，巍然屹立。又如，《荀子·子道》提到，“知者自知，仁者自爱”，而“知者知人，仁者爱人”。勇则是以知与仁为前提和基础的。《论语·泰伯》中的“勇而无礼则乱”和《论语·问政》中的“见义不为，无勇也”，都是在强调勇要服从于礼、服务于义。由此可见，正如《礼记·中庸》所言，“知、仁、勇，三者天下之达德也”，智慧、仁德、英勇是天底下通行不变的品德，是中国传统文化中的崇高标准。 知者不惑，对当今亚太各国而言，就是要正确理解、把握本地区的历史与现实，继续维护公平正义与和平稳定。鉴往事，知来者。过去几十年，亚太区域经济合作之所以蓬勃发展、之所以能创造举世瞩目的“亚太奇迹”，完全得益于和平稳定的环境。其中最为关键的历史经验即各国相互尊重、团结合作，遇到事情大家商量着办、寻求最大公约数。当前，国际社会再次站到了历史的十字路口，已成为全球经济增长动力之源的亚太各国不应该有丝毫疑惑与犹豫，应继续相互尊重、携手合作，共同守护地区的稳定与繁荣，以此为全球的安全与发展注入不竭新动力。 仁者不忧，对当今亚太各国而言，就是要尊重协调各国的发展需求与人民关切，开放包容、协调平衡、共享繁荣。一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。亚太地区的发展必然是地区各国共同且可持续的发展。共同的发展，要求亚太各国跳出患得患失的“小算盘”，真正坚持开放的区域主义，加强政策协调，切实推动地区经济一体化，共商共建共享，最终实现亚太全体人民的共同富裕。可持续的发展，要求亚太各国在发展经济、平衡协调不同诉求的同时，高度重视平衡人与自然的和谐，实现高质量的绿色低碳发展，大力推进能源资源、产业结构、消费结构转型升级，实现清洁美丽的地区目标。在发展与生态这两大维度上，亚太地区的成就与贡献无疑具有不可替代的世界意义。 勇者不惧，对当今亚太各国而言，就是要坚持命运与共，守望相助，维护好亚太合作的正确方向，有效应对不同维度的各类重大挑战。亚太各国必须在公平正义、开放包容的基础上，勇于通过对话协商的和平方式来处理管控内部分歧与潜在矛盾，勇于通过相互尊重、合作共赢的务实方式来抵御某些“冷战思维”和“单边主义”构成的阻碍与挑衅，勇于通过同舟共济、同心协力的团结方式来应对公共卫生、气候变化、粮食与能源安全等当前全人类共同面对的全球与地区挑战。亚太地区的“大家庭”应勇于担当，以不断深化互信、包容、合作、共赢的亚太伙伴关系来引领世界发展方向。 作为负责任的大国，新时代中国坚持走中国式现代化道路，维护团结、勇担责任。中国坚持构建相互尊重、公平正义、合作共赢的新型国际关系，坚持正确义利观，致力于实现全球共同安全与全球共同发展，为包括亚太地区在内的世界各国的持续发展与繁荣提供中国智慧与中国方案，继续同世界特别是亚太分享中国发展的机遇。只有各国行天下之大道，和睦相处、合作共赢，繁荣才能持久，安全才有保障。这才是亚太乃至全球共同发展、持续繁荣、守护共同命运的人间正道。 《光明日报》（ 2023年01月31日 02版）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208191446/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215678.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208053831/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215678.html,2023-02-09 0:00:00,"[Bright Forum - Warm Up] Those who know are not confused, those who are benevolent are not worried, and those who are courageous are not afraid Source: Guangming Net - Guangming Daily Author: Diao Daming Editor-in-Chief: Huang Min 2023-01-31 10:38:52 0","By Diao Daming (Research Fellow, Xi Jinping Institute of Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Renmin University of China; Research Fellow, Renmin University of China Contemporary Political Parties Research Platform) In November 2022, President Xi Jinping attended the 29th Informal Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and delivered an important speech titled ""Unity, Cooperation and Courageous Responsibility for Building a Community of Destiny in the Asia-Pacific"", which provided a clear direction for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. In his speech, President Xi Jinping pointed out the direction for Asia-Pacific cooperation. In his speech, President Xi Jinping quoted the ancient Chinese saying ""Those who know are not confused, those who are benevolent are not worried, and those who are brave are not afraid"", and proposed to build ""peace and stability,"" ""common prosperity,"" ""cleanliness and beauty,"" and ""a common future"" for the Asia-Pacific region. The initiative of building an Asia-Pacific that is ""peaceful and stable,"" ""common prosperity,"" ""clean and beautiful,"" and ""mutual support"" has stirred up strong positive energy for unity and cooperation and development, and has pushed all countries to join hands to build an Asia-Pacific community of destiny and create a new glory for Asia-Pacific cooperation. ""Those who know are not confused, those who are benevolent are not worried, and those who are courageous are not afraid"" is from Confucius' ""Analects of Confucius - Zihan"". Its basic meaning is that those who are wise will not be confused, those who are benevolent will not worry, and those who are brave will not be afraid. Confucius intended to warn his disciples and the world that they should constantly seek true knowledge to minimize their confusion; they should sincerely treat others as they would like to be treated; they should not worry about their personal gains and losses; and they should be courageous in practice and not be afraid of any difficulties. Among them, knowledge and benevolence are noble virtues that are often mentioned together in Chinese cultural traditions. For example, in the Analects of Confucius, it is said, ""He who knows is happy with the water, and he who is benevolent is happy with the mountain,"" meaning that a wise man is as adaptable as flowing water, with endless wisdom; and he who has benevolence and virtue is as firm as a mountain, standing tall and tall. Another example is Xunzi Zidao (The Way of the Son), which says, ""He who knows knows himself, and he who is benevolent loves himself"", while ""He who knows knows others, and he who is benevolent loves others"". Courage, on the other hand, is premised and based on knowledge and benevolence. The saying ""Courage without propriety is chaotic"" in The Analects of Confucius - Tai Bo and the saying ""If you do not do what is right, you are not courageous"" in The Analects of Confucius - Questioning Politics both emphasize that courage is subordinate to propriety and serves the cause of righteousness. From this, we can see that, as stated in the Book of Rites - Meanwhile, ""Knowledge, benevolence and courage are the three great virtues of the world"". Wisdom, benevolence and courage are the virtues that pass unchanged under the heavens, and they are the lofty standards of traditional Chinese culture. For the Asia-Pacific countries today, it is necessary to correctly understand and grasp the history and reality of the region, and to continue to safeguard fairness, justice, peace and stability. We should learn from the past to know the future. Over the past few decades, economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region has flourished and created the ""Asia-Pacific Miracle"" that has attracted worldwide attention, thanks to a peaceful and stable environment. One of the most crucial historical experiences is that countries respect each other, cooperate in solidarity, and seek to maximize the common denominator by discussing all matters. At present, the international community is once again at the crossroads of history, and the Asia-Pacific countries, which have become the source of global economic growth, should not have the slightest doubt or hesitation, but should continue to respect each other, work hand in hand, and jointly safeguard the stability and prosperity of the region, thus injecting new and inexhaustible impetus into global security and development. For the Asia-Pacific countries today, it means respecting and coordinating the development needs and concerns of the people of each country, being open and inclusive, harmonizing and balancing, and sharing prosperity. It is not spring when one flower blooms alone, but when a hundred flowers bloom together, spring fills the garden. The development of the Asia-Pacific region is inevitably the common and sustainable development of all countries in the region. Common development requires Asia-Pacific countries to get rid of the ""small calculations"" of loss and gain, truly adhere to open regionalism, strengthen policy coordination, effectively promote regional economic integration, and ultimately realize the common prosperity of all the people of the Asia-Pacific region through joint construction and sharing. Sustainable development requires Asia-Pacific countries, while developing their economies and balancing and coordinating different demands, to attach great importance to balancing the harmony between human beings and nature, realizing high-quality green and low-carbon development, and vigorously pushing forward the transformation and upgrading of energy resources, industrial structure, and consumption structure, so as to realize the goal of a clean and beautiful region. In the two dimensions of development and ecology, the achievements and contributions of the Asia-Pacific region are undoubtedly of irreplaceable global significance. For the Asia-Pacific countries today, the courageous will not be afraid, which means that they should adhere to the principle of shared destiny and mutual assistance, maintain the correct direction of Asia-Pacific cooperation, and effectively respond to various major challenges in different dimensions. On the basis of fairness, justice, openness and inclusiveness, Asia-Pacific countries must have the courage to deal with and control internal differences and potential contradictions through peaceful means of dialog and consultation, and the courage to resist the obstacles and provocations posed by certain ""Cold War mentality"" and ""unilateralism"" through the pragmatic means of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. The Asia-Pacific region has the courage to resist the obstacles and provocations posed by the ""cold war mentality"" and ""unilateralism"" through mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and to respond to the current global and regional challenges faced by all humankind, such as public health, climate change, and food and energy security, through solidarity and unity in the same boat. The Asia-Pacific ""big family"" should have the courage to take up the responsibility to lead the direction of world development by continuously deepening the Asia-Pacific partnership of mutual trust, inclusiveness, cooperation and win-win situation. As a responsible big country, China in the new era insists on taking the path of Chinese-style modernization, safeguarding unity and assuming responsibility. China insists on building a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation, adheres to the correct concept of righteousness and profitability, is committed to realizing common global security and common global development, and provides Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for the sustained development and prosperity of all countries in the world, including those in the Asia-Pacific region, and will continue to share with the world, especially the Asia-Pacific region, the opportunities for China's development. Only when all countries walk the path of the world, live in harmony and cooperate in a win-win situation can prosperity be sustained and security guaranteed. This is the right way on earth for the Asia-Pacific and even the world to develop together, continue to prosper, and guard our common destiny.

“六个必须坚持”是科学的世界观和方法论 来源：求是网 作者：是说新语 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-01-30 10:31:30 0,党的二十大报告指出：“继续推进实践基础上的理论创新，首先要把握好新时代中国特色社会主义思想的世界观和方法论，坚持好、运用好贯穿其中的立场观点方法。”报告强调必须坚持人民至上、必须坚持自信自立、必须坚持守正创新、必须坚持问题导向、必须坚持系统观念、必须坚持胸怀天下。 “六个必须坚持”从世界观和方法论高度，系统概括了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的立场观点方法，既是深刻理解这一科学思想必须牢牢把握的基本点，也是继续推进理论创新必须始终坚持的基本点。 2022年10月8日，观众在“奋进新时代”主题成就展中央综合展区内拍摄中国经济“奇迹号”巨轮模型。新华社记者 李鑫/摄 世界观是人们关于世界的总看法和根本观点。当人们以一定的世界观观察问题、处理问题时，世界观也就有了方法论意义。世界观侧重说明世界“是什么”，方法论侧重说明“怎么办”；世界观决定怎么去“想”，方法论决定怎么去“做”，二者统一于人的实践。辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是马克思主义世界观和方法论，也是我们党一以贯之的世界观和方法论。 党的十八大以来，国内外形势新变化和实践新要求，迫切需要我们党从理论和实践的结合上深入回答关系党和国家事业发展、党治国理政的一系列重大时代课题。以习近平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人勇于进行理论探索和创新，以全新的视野深化对共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律、人类社会发展规律的认识，取得重大理论创新成果，集中体现为习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。新时代十年，正是在这一科学思想指引下，我们党团结带领人民采取一系列战略性举措，推进一系列变革性实践，实现一系列突破性进展，取得一系列标志性成果，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革。 习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想既讲是什么、为什么，又讲怎么看、怎么办，既部署“过河”的任务，又指导解决“桥或船”的问题，生动体现了马克思主义世界观和方法论的统一。“六个必须坚持”深刻揭示了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的理论品格和鲜明特质，其中，人民至上是根本的价值立场，自信自立是内在的精神特质，守正创新是鲜明的理论品格，问题导向是源头活水，系统观念是基本工作方法，胸怀天下是特有的大视野大境界。 “六个必须坚持”虽然是第一次作为一个整体集中提出，但其主要内涵贯穿体现在“十个明确”、“十四个坚持”、“十三个方面成就”的全部内容之中。比如，党的十九大报告所阐述的“十四个坚持”基本方略中：坚持以人民为中心、坚持人民当家作主、坚持在发展中保障和改善民生等，都是坚持人民至上的体现；坚持全面深化改革、坚持全面依法治国、坚持人与自然和谐共生、坚持总体国家安全观等，都蕴含着对系统观念的运用；坚持推动构建人类命运共同体，则是坚持胸怀天下的体现。“六个必须坚持”与党的百年奋斗历史经验一脉相承。党的十九届六中全会通过《中共中央关于党的百年奋斗重大成就和历史经验的决议》，把党的百年奋斗历史经验概括为“十个坚持”，其中就有坚持人民至上、坚持理论创新、坚持独立自主、坚持胸怀天下等。 “六个必须坚持”构成相互联系、内在统一的有机整体，为我们把握好习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的精髓、进一步提高全党马克思主义理论水平提供了“金钥匙”。 更多精彩内容，详见北京市习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心署名文章《学好用好习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的世界观和方法论》 （策划：旷思思 审核：李艳玲）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208191446/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215382.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230208053733/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215382.html,2023-02-09 0:00:00,"The ""six must be adhered to"" is a scientific worldview and methodology Source: Seeking the truth Author: is to say new words Responsibility: Huang Min 2023-01-30 10:31:30 0","The report of the 20th Party Congress states, ""To continue to push forward theoretical innovation on the basis of practice, we must first of all grasp the worldview and methodology of socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and adhere to and utilize the position and viewpoint methodology that runs through it."" The report emphasizes that we must adhere to the people's supremacy, self-confidence and self-reliance, observance of justice and innovation, problem orientation, systematic concepts, and a mindfulness of the world. The ""six must adhere to"" systematically summarize the position and viewpoint methodology of Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics for the new era from the height of worldview and methodology, which is not only the basic point that must be firmly grasped for a profound understanding of this scientific thought, but also the basic point that must always be adhered to when continuing to push forward theoretical innovation. On Oct. 8, 2022, visitors take photos of a model of China's economic ""miracle ship"" in the central comprehensive exhibition area of the ""Endeavouring a New Era"" themed achievement exhibition. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Xin/caption Worldview is people's general and fundamental view of the world. When people observe and deal with problems with a certain worldview, the worldview has a methodological significance. Worldview focuses on explaining what the world ""is"", methodology focuses on explaining ""how to do""; worldview determines how to ""think"", methodology determines how to The worldview determines how to ""think"" and the methodology determines how to ""do"", both of which are unified in human practice. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the worldview and methodology of Marxism, as well as the consistent worldview and methodology of our Party. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, new changes in the situation at home and abroad and new requirements in practice have made it urgent for the Party to answer in depth a series of major issues of the times relating to the development of the Party and the country and the Party's governance from the combination of theory and practice. The Chinese Communists, mainly represented by Comrade Xi Jinping, have been brave in theoretical exploration and innovation, deepening their understanding of the laws of Communist Party governance, socialist construction and human social development with a brand new vision, and achieving major theoretical innovations, which are centrally embodied in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In the decade of the new era, it is under the guidance of this scientific thought that the Party has united and led the people to take a series of strategic initiatives, push forward a series of transformative practices, realize a series of breakthroughs, and achieve a series of landmark results, resulting in the Party and the country's cause making historic achievements and undergoing historic changes. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era not only talks about what and why, but also how to look at it and how to do it, and not only deploys the task of ""crossing the river"" but also guides the solution to the problem of ""bridges or boats,"" which vividly embodies the unity of the worldview and methodology of Marxism. The ""six must be adhered to"" profoundly reveals the theoretical character and distinctive qualities of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, in which the people first is the fundamental value stance, self-confidence and self-reliance is the intrinsic spiritual quality, observance of righteousness and innovation is the distinctive theoretical character, problem orientation is the source of living water, the systematic conception is the basic working method, and the broad vision and large scope of the world is the characteristic of Xi. The world is characterized by a big vision and a big realm. Although the ""six must be insisted upon"" is put forward as a whole for the first time, its main connotation is reflected in the ""ten clear"" and ""fourteen insistences"", ""Thirteen Achievements"". For example, among the ""fourteen insistence"" basic strategies elaborated in the report of the 19th CPC National Congress: insisting on people-centeredness, insisting on people's sovereignty, and insisting on safeguarding and improving people's livelihoods in the course of development are all embodiments of insisting on the supremacy of the people; insisting on the deepening of reforms in a comprehensive manner, insisting on the rule of law in a comprehensive manner, insisting on the harmonious coexistence of human beings and nature, and insisting on the overall concept of national security. Adherence to deepening reform in a comprehensive manner, adherence to the rule of law in a comprehensive manner, adherence to the harmonious coexistence of human beings and nature, and adherence to the overall concept of national security all imply the application of the concept of the system; adherence to the promotion of the building of a community of shared destiny for mankind is a manifestation of adherence to the world. The ""six must be adhered to"" are in line with the Party's historical experience of 100 years of struggle. The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee adopted the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Significant Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party's Centennial Struggle, which summarizes the Party's historical experience of its century-long struggle as ""ten adherences"", including adherence to the primacy of the people, adherence to theoretical innovation, adherence to independence and autonomy, and adherence to bearing the world in mind. ""The ""Six Insistences"" constitute an interconnected and internally unified organic whole, providing a golden key for us to grasp the essence of Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, and to further improve the level of Marxist theory of the whole party.

The way to strengthen the army is to get people. For the people's army, talent is a key factor in winning the initiative of military competition and future wars. To implement the spirit of President Xi's important instructions, to achieve the goal of one hundred years of the army on schedule, and to accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army, we are required to firmly establish a strong sense of talent as the first resource, to comprehensively implement the strategy of strengthening the army with talents in the new era, and to continuously cultivate and create high-quality and specialized new military talents capable of taking on the important task of strengthening the army. Strengthen the strategic thinking of talents. At present, the world's unprecedented big change accelerated evolution, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial change in-depth development, talent has become the world's countries scramble for the first resource. The military field is the most intense competition and confrontation of talent in the field, no talent, insufficient talent, talent quality is not high, the army can not win the war. Party organs at all levels, especially the leading cadres should stand in the overall situation and strategic height, insight into the situation, assess the situation, with a broader vision, more open concept, effectively put talent training in a strategic position, grasp and grasp the talent training planning work, take up the main responsibility, ahead of the planning, ahead of the layout, ahead of the cultivation, to play a good talent training initiative, with the talent of the eyes, love talent sincerity, talent with the courage, With a discerning eye for talent, a sincere love of talent, the courage to utilize talent, the grace to accommodate talent, and a good prescription to gather talent, we will strive to form a vivid situation in which more talent is produced, more talent is produced quickly, and more talent is utilized to the best of its ability. Tightly twisting the starting and ending point of preparation for war, building a new type of military personnel training system, innovative military human resource management, accelerating the forging of joint combat command personnel, advance the presetting of new types of combat force personnel, incentives to support high-level scientific and technological innovation personnel, complex training of high-level strategic management personnel. At the same time, strengthen the military communication and collaboration, adhere to the military demand-oriented, improve the planning docking, policy docking, work docking, and promote the military talent work into the depth of the construction of a strong talent country. The standard for selecting and employing people is accurate. ""The root of the rule is to get people, to get people in the review, the review in the nuclear true."" To strictly identify and select people, especially highlight the political level, the political standard as the primary criterion for selecting and employing people. To carefully improve the system and mechanism of talent selection, do a deep and practical investigation of political quality, not only listen to their words, but also to observe their behavior, not only to observe their table, but also to analyze its inside, to see the political loyalty, to see the political determination, to see the political responsibility, to see the political ability, to see the political self-discipline. To polish the vision of selecting and employing people. Some talents will only bury their heads to do a good job, will not raise their heads to find a way out. If we design the hiring system so that the ""thousand mile horse"" to rest, ""old bull"" to put down, the officer of the people cold, it is the opposite. To improve the daily assessment, classification assessment of the examination system, the talent both to view the whole picture, but also to get a glimpse of the spot; both to see the reputation, but also to focus on performance; both to see the work circle, but also to see the circle of life, and effectively to the moral and talent of high-quality talents selected. To actively guide the talent enthusiastically into the hot practice of the strong military, in the major tasks, military exercises, martial arts assessment, research and development in the fight level, than out of energy, in the case of the policy allows the advanced first, the excellent priority, competent win, with a clear orientation to motivate the talent to firmly ""have to do"" in order to ""have a place"". ""There is a place"" belief, carry ""there is a place"" must be ""there for"" the bearer, cultivate ""there is no need for"" The realm of ""position"", based on their own work to create ""have for"" the work performance. Give full play to the advantages of people make the best use of their talents. Talent is elected, but also with out. Han Gaozu Liu Bang summarized the success of the experience, said: ""The planner in the tent, the decision to win in a thousand miles away, I am not as good as Zifang. Town country, caress the people, give feed, not extinct grain road, I'm not as good as Xiao He. Even millions of troops, the battle will be won, the attack will be taken, I am not as good as Han Xin."" If you can do with its strengths, with its place, with its time, the ability of the talent will be doubled amplification and efficient release; on the contrary, it will make the ability of the talent to play a big discount. Therefore, leaders and authorities at all levels in the actual work must know the people and do a good job, do a detailed examination and assessment work, scientific analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the talent, accurate configuration of the right position, with its strengths, avoid its weaknesses, for each position with the most suitable talent, so that each talent plays a role in the most suitable position. However, we must see that the talent in the growth process can not be done every time every thing is perfect, flawless, will inevitably make mistakes, and even make mistakes. This requires us to adhere to the combination of strict control and love, the establishment of a sound mechanism for error tolerance and correction, tolerance of talent in the reform and innovation of mistakes and errors, not a cataract to cover the great virtues, and clearly for those who dare to take responsibility for the work of the practical work, do not seek personal gain of the talents backing and encouragement, maximize mobilization of talent, initiative, creativity, and encourage talent to let go of their hands, and the initiative to the grass-roots front-line, eat the strong position of the wind and rain, to see the world! The company has been working on the development of a new technology, and has been working on the development of a new technology. At the same time, do a good job of service and protection work, find ways to solve the practical difficulties in the work and life of the talents, and actively do practical things for them to solve problems, eliminate the worries of the talents, so that they can devote all their thoughts and energy to the cause of the strong army, to achieve the goal of 100 years of the army as scheduled, and accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army to contribute their own wisdom and strength.

军事论坛丨“灰度认知”与“黑白决策” 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：毛炜豪 责任编辑：尚晓敏 2023-02-09 08:03:27 0,“灰度认知”与“黑白决策” ■毛炜豪 要点提示 ●如果把灰度认知视作一个从白到黑的渐变色带，黑白决策就是在这条色带上划一条分界线。无论作战筹划阶段的“认知灰度”如何，最终决策只能是非黑即白的。 ●作为指挥员，应积极培养和强化理性思维，在分析筹划阶段保持灰度认知，而在定下作战决心时则坚持黑白决策，既在策略上保持高度的灵活性，又在行动上保持坚定的原则性，同时尽量“预留缓冲区”。 决策学领域专家认为，理性思维的最佳组合是“灰度认知、黑白决策”。比如天气预报说今天下雨的概率是70%，意思是下雨可能性较大，但也可能不下雨，这就是灰度认知。但在决策上，要么带伞要么不带，我们不可能带一把70%的伞，这就是黑白决策。所以，灰度认知是一种评估选项阶段的量化思维，需要接受不确定性、不带预设立场、保持头脑开放；而黑白决策则是形成决策阶段的定性思维，需要寻求确定性、选择非黑即白、不能模棱两可。 作战筹划时应保持灰度认知 作战筹划阶段，是对问题进行剖析和研究的过程。此时应保持灰度认知，将问题精确量化，从而为黑白决策提供支持。例如，二战太平洋战争初期，美军舰船屡遭日机攻击，损失惨重。为研究对策，美军征集大批数学家对400多个战例进行深入研究，并得出两个结论：一是当日军飞机采取高空俯冲轰炸时，美军舰船采取急速摆动规避战术的损失率为20%，采取缓慢摆动的损失率为100%；二是当日军飞机采取低空俯冲轰炸时，美军舰船采取急速摆动和缓慢摆动的损失率均为57%。显而易见，最佳应对策略就是只要敌机来袭，均采取急速摆动规避战术。据估算，美军这一决策使舰船损失率从62%降至27%。这种量化分析的方式，将规避战术的不确定性转化为概率问题，帮助美军找到了解决方案。这就是典型的灰度认知。 灰度认知的量化分析方法还有很多。如“投票表态”，就是群体决策过程中对不同观点分布情况进行量化描述的常用方法。但这种方法的缺点在于，多数人的意见只能代表主流，却未必正确。为了在量化分析的同时尽量提高决策的正确率，还可以采取“可信度加权”的方式。其中，“可信”指的是“意见可信”，即提供意见的人员需要具备一定的专业素养；“加权”就是“乘以权重”，即不同专家的意见应根据过往表现分配不同权重。这种方式可以让灰度认知由“模糊”变得相对“精确”。 这一分析机制同样适用于作战决策。例如，部队召开作战会议，就采取哪种作战方案进行表态。其中，每名与会成员的意见权重不同。虽然最终方案还是由指挥员拍板，但这种基于可信度加权的集体分析方式，会让决策者充分参考其他人的视角和观点，从而更理性地看待不同方案的可行性和潜在风险。在平时一些重大事项的评估决策中，为了更科学地分配权重，还可以组建“专家组”。每名专家都有表达意见的权利，但每个人的意见权重会有差别。对于那些分析方法更专业、分析问题更准确的专家，决策机制会赋予更高的权重。经过加权统计，最后得到一个群体意见，供决策者参考。 定下决心时应坚持黑白决策 黑白决策是灰度认知的目的和结果。无论作战筹划阶段的“认知灰度”如何，最终决策只能是非黑即白的。因此，定下决心时应坚持黑白决策。如果把灰度认知视作一个从白到黑的渐变色带，黑白决策就是在这条色带上划一条分界线。有时哪怕不符合逻辑，也要划线。就像任何考试都有明确的录取分数线，为了确保公平，在名额有限的情况下，必须有这么一条线。 录取分数线可以根据最后一名的成绩划线，这很简单也很合理。但在很多决策场景中，这条线很难划定。比如城市战场上，敌我力量犬牙交错，大量民众混杂其中，这些人是敌是友？如何区别对待？复杂地形条件下，敌人准备实施进攻，我选择有利地形实施防御，防御前沿应该放在哪里？何时实施反击？此类作战决策的本质是一样的，都是要在灰度认知空间划一条决策线。不过线，则保持现状；过了线，就应该果断作出改变。 划线的一个重要策略是“预留缓冲区”。想象从左至右，有一个由白到黑的渐变色带，即左白右黑，中间灰色。那么这条线就应该划在相对靠左的位置，也就是白色与灰色区域接壤的位置。中间的灰色区域就是缓冲区。过了缓冲区，灰色才会变黑。为什么要预留缓冲区？因为灰度认知意味着认知空间存在一定的不确定性，而黑白决策则是“在不确定性中寻求有限的确定性”。预留缓冲区，是为了最大限度地降低决策风险，确保决策结果可控，并为后续行动预留更大决策空间。 一个典型案例是从1958年8月23日持续到1978年12月31日的“金门炮战”。其主要背景是：1954年底美蒋签订了“共同防御条约”，美军公然开始进驻台湾，台海局势逐渐紧张，但美蒋存在一个重要分歧，就是协防范围是否应包括大陆沿海岛屿。为了探明美军的协防决心，毛泽东主席决定炮击金门。1958年8月开始炮击，金门被火力封锁后，美舰试图为国民党军补给舰艇护航，我军实施“只打蒋舰，不打美舰”的策略。当时很多官兵不理解这个命令——美军不是敌人吗，为什么不打？其实这就是毛泽东的高明之处。因为当时中美之间并不是简单的“非友即敌”关系，中间存在灰色地带。我方的决策，相当于在灰度认知空间划出了第一条线。这条线是在对美军协防决心不确定的条件下，作出的谨慎而稳妥的决策，其目的就是通过预留缓冲区，既能试探美军决心，又规避了与美军发生直接冲突的风险，保留了进一步升级行动的可能。结果在看到国民党军舰艇损失惨重后，美舰掉头就跑。由此，我方摸清美方底牌，即协防金门、马祖的意志并不坚决，而是相机行事。此时灰度认知的不确定性被大幅消减，为黑白决策提供了更大决策空间。 美军护航失败后，提出了“停火案”，要求国民党军退出金、马，甚至公开宣布美国没有也不想承担“保卫”金、马等岛屿的法律义务。我方分析，美国此举一方面是避免卷入战争，另一方面也是为了让台湾与大陆彻底脱离，以制造“划峡而治”的既定事实。而蒋介石基于“反攻大陆”的主要考量，表示将“坚守金马外岛”。美蒋双方在金、马撤军问题上的争执愈演愈烈，矛盾公开化。面对这一局面，为了挫败美国的分裂图谋，同时留下一扇和平谈判的大门，我方决定“让金、马留在蒋介石手中”。于是暂停炮击金门，允许国民党军队在没有美舰护航条件下运输补给物资，并制定了对金、马“打而不登、封而不死”的新策略。这相当于划出了第二条线。这条线同样基于灰度认知，即在美国的分裂企图面前，两岸可以求同存异，达成一定程度的默契。果不其然，这一策略增加了蒋拒绝从金、马撤军的筹码，进而粉碎了美国的分裂企图。此后，毛泽东又指示逢双不打、单日略打，打击区域也逐渐转入无人区。“金门炮战”成为两岸心照不宣的“政治战”，一直持续到中美建交。 随着时代的发展，现代战争战场态势逐渐呈现空间多域、力量多元、行动多维等特点，战场的灰色空间越来越大。如何用灰度认知支撑黑白决策，成为越来越重要的决策难题。作为指挥员，应积极培养和强化理性思维，在分析筹划阶段保持灰度认知，而在定下作战决心时则坚持黑白决策，既在策略上保持高度的灵活性，又在行动上保持坚定的原则性，同时尽量“预留缓冲区”，确保每一步决策都安全可控，从而最大限度地实现战争决策的科学化和精确化。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230211172008/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16200333.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230214001557/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16200333.html,2023-02-12 0:00:00,"Military Forum丨 ""Gray Scale Cognition"" and ""Black and White Decision Making"" Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Mao Weihao Editor in Chief：Shang Xiaomin 2023-02-09 08:03:27 0","""Gray Scale Cognition"" and ""Black and White Decision Making"" ■Weihao Mao Key Points ●If gray scale cognition is regarded as a gradient color band from white to black, black and white decision making is to draw a demarcation line on this band. Regardless of the gray scale of cognition in the battle planning stage, the final decision can only be black or white. As a commander, he should actively cultivate and strengthen rational thinking, maintain the gray scale cognition in the analysis and planning stage, and insist on black and white decision-making when he makes up his mind for the battle, not only maintaining a high degree of flexibility in strategy, but also maintaining a firm principle in action, and at the same time trying his best to ""reserve buffer zones"". Experts in the field of decision-making believe that the best combination of rational thinking is ""gray-scale cognition, black and white decision-making"". For example, the weather forecast says that the probability of rain today is 70%, meaning that it is more likely to rain, but it may not rain, which is the gray-scale cognition. But in decision making, either you bring an umbrella or you don't, we can't bring an umbrella with a 70% probability, that's black and white decision making. So, grayscale cognition is a quantitative mindset in the assessment of options stage, which requires accepting uncertainty, carrying no preconceptions, and keeping an open mind; while black and white decision-making is a qualitative mindset in the formation of decision-making stage, which requires seeking certainty, choosing either-black-or-white, and not being able to be ambiguous. Operational planning should maintain a gray-scale cognition Operational planning stage is the process of analyzing and studying the problem. At this point, one should maintain a gray-scale perception and quantify the problem accurately so as to provide support for black-and-white decision-making. For example, at the beginning of the Pacific War of World War II, U.S. ships were repeatedly attacked by Japanese aircraft and suffered heavy losses. In order to study countermeasures, the U.S. Army enlisted a large number of mathematicians to conduct an in-depth study of more than 400 war cases, and came to two conclusions: First, when the Japanese aircraft to take high-altitude dive bombing, the U.S. ships to take a sharp swing evasive tactics of the loss rate of 20%, to take a slow swing of the loss rate of 100%; Second, when the Japanese aircraft to take a low-altitude dive bombing, the U.S. ships to take a sharp swing and a slow swing of the loss rate of 57%. Both are 57%. Obviously, the best response strategy was to adopt the rapid swing avoidance tactic whenever enemy planes attacked. It is estimated that this decision by the U.S. military reduced the ship loss rate from 62% to 27%. This quantitative analysis of the uncertainty of avoidance tactics into a probabilistic problem helped the U.S. military find a solution. This is typical of grayscale cognition. There are many other ways to quantitatively analyze grayscale cognition. For example, ""voting"" is a common method to quantitatively describe the distribution of different views in the group decision-making process. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the majority opinion can only represent the mainstream, but may not be correct. In order to maximize the correctness of the decision while quantitatively analyzing, the method of ""credibility weighting"" can also be adopted. Among them, ""credible"" refers to ""credible opinions"", that is, to provide advice on the need to have a certain degree of professionalism; ""weighted"" is ""multiply by Weighted"" means ""multiplied by"", i.e. the opinions of different experts should be assigned different weights according to their past performance. In this way, the gray-scale cognition can be made relatively ""precise"" from ""fuzzy"". This analysis mechanism is also applicable to operational decision-making. For example, a troop holds a combat meeting to decide which combat plan to adopt. Each member of the meeting has a different weight of opinion. Although the final plan is still made by the commander, this collective analysis based on credibility weighting will allow the decision maker to fully refer to other people's perspectives and views, so as to more rationally look at the feasibility and potential risks of different options. In order to assign weights more scientifically in the evaluation and decision-making of some major matters, an ""expert group"" can also be formed. Each expert has the right to express his or her opinion, but the weight of each opinion will vary. For those experts whose analytical methods are more professional and who analyze the problem more accurately, the decision-making mechanism will assign higher weights. After weighted statistics, a group opinion is finally obtained for decision makers' reference. Black-and-white decision-making should be adhered to when making up one's mind Black-and-white decision-making is the purpose and result of gray-scale cognition. Regardless of the ""cognitive gray scale"" in the battle planning stage, the final decision can only be black or white. Therefore, black and white decision-making should be adhered to when making up one's mind. If we consider the gray scale cognition as a gradient color band from white to black, black and white decision-making is to draw a demarcation line on this color band. Sometimes it is necessary to draw a line even if it is not logical. Just as there is a clear cut-off line for admission to any examination, there has to be such a line in order to ensure fairness, given the limited number of places available. The admission score line can be drawn based on the last place finish, which is simple and logical. But in many decision-making scenarios, the line is difficult to draw. For example, on an urban battlefield, where enemy and enemy forces are intertwined and a large number of people are mixed in, are these people enemies or friends? How can they be treated differently? Complex terrain conditions, the enemy is ready to implement the attack, I choose favorable terrain to implement the defense, the defensive front should be placed where? When to counterattack? The essence of this type of combat decision-making is the same, is to draw a decision line in the gray-scale cognitive space. If the line is not drawn, the status quo is maintained; if the line is crossed, changes should be made decisively. An important strategy for drawing the line is to ""set aside a buffer zone"". Imagine that from left to right, there is a gradation of colors from white to black, i.e., white on the left, black on the right, and gray in the middle. The line should be drawn relatively to the left, where the white and gray areas border. The gray area in the middle is the buffer. It is only after the buffer zone that the gray becomes black. Why reserve the buffer zone? Because gray-scale cognition means that there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the cognitive space, while black and white decision-making is ""seeking limited certainty in uncertainty"". The purpose of reserving a buffer zone is to minimize the risk of decision-making, to ensure that the outcome of the decision is controllable, and to reserve more decision-making space for subsequent actions. A typical example is the ""Kinmen Artillery Battle"" that lasted from August 23, 1958 to December 31, 1978. The main background is that at the end of 1954, the U.S. and Chiang signed the Mutual Defense Treaty, and the U.S. military openly began to station in Taiwan, and the situation in the Taiwan Strait gradually became tense, but the U.S. and Chiang had an important difference of opinion, that is, whether or not the scope of defense should include the mainland's coastal islands. In order to find out the determination of the U.S. military to assist in the defense, Chairman Mao Zedong decided to shell Kinmen, which began in August 1958. after Kinmen was blockaded by fire, the U.S. ships attempted to escort the Kuomintang's supply ships, and the army implemented the strategy of ""only hitting Chiang's ships, not the U.S. ones."" many officers and soldiers did not understand this order. At that time, many officers and soldiers did not understand this order - the U.S. Army is not the enemy, why not fight? In fact, this was Mao Zedong's brilliance. Because at that time, the relationship between China and the United States was not a simple ""friend or foe"" relationship, there was a gray area in the middle. Our decision was equivalent to drawing the first line in the gray cognitive space. This line is a prudent and steady decision made under the uncertainty of the determination of the U.S. military to assist in the defense of the country. Its purpose is to reserve a buffer zone to test the determination of the U.S. military while avoiding the risk of direct conflict with the U.S. military and retaining the possibility of further escalation of the operation. As a result, after seeing the heavy losses of the KMT ships, the U.S. ships turned around and ran away. As a result, we figured out the bottom line of the U.S. side, i.e., the will to assist in the defense of Kinmen and Matsu was not resolute, but rather to act in a camera-ready manner. At this point, the uncertainty of gray-scale cognition was drastically reduced, providing more decision space for black-and-white decision-making. After the failure of the U.S. military escort, the U.S. proposed a ""cease-fire case"" and demanded that the Kuomintang army withdraw from Kinmen and Matsu, and even openly announced that the U.S. did not have and did not want to assume the legal obligation of ""defending"" Kinmen, Matsu and other islands. We analyzed that the U.S. move was to avoid getting involved in the war on the one hand, and to completely separate Taiwan from the mainland on the other hand, in order to create the established fact of ""ruling by drawing the gorge"". Chiang Kai-shek, on the other hand, based on the main consideration of ""counter-attacking the mainland"", said that he would ""hold fast to the outer islands of Jinma"". The dispute between the U.S. and Chiang over the withdrawal of troops from Jin and Ma intensified and the conflict became public. Faced with this situation, in order to thwart the U.S.'s secessionist plans and leave the door open for peace talks, we decided to ""let Jin and Ma remain in Chiang's hands"". So we suspended the shelling of Kinmen, allowed the KMT troops to transport supplies without the escort of American ships, and formulated a new strategy of ""beating but not boarding, sealing but not dying"" for Kinmen and Ma. This amounted to drawing a second line. This line is also based on a gray-scale perception that, in the face of U.S. attempts at secession, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can seek common ground while reserving differences and reach a certain degree of tacit understanding. As it turned out, this strategy increased Chiang's leverage in refusing to withdraw his troops from Jin and Ma, and thus crushed the U.S. attempt at secession. Thereafter, Mao Zedong instructed that no fighting should be conducted on every double day, and some fighting should be conducted on a single day, and the strike area was gradually shifted to no man's land. The ""Kinmen Artillery Battle"" became an undeclared ""political war"" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which lasted until the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. With the development of the times, the battlefield situation of modern war gradually presents the characteristics of spatial multidomain, power diversity, and multidimensional action, and the gray space of the battlefield is getting bigger and bigger. How to support black and white decision-making with gray-scale cognition has become an increasingly important decision-making challenge. As a commander, should actively cultivate and strengthen rational thinking, in the analysis and planning stage to maintain the gray scale cognition, and in the determination to set the battle is to adhere to the black and white decision-making, not only in the strategy to maintain a high degree of flexibility, but also in the action to maintain a firm principle, and at the same time as far as possible to ""reserve buffer zone"", to ensure that each step of the decision-making are safe and controllable, so that the maximum realization of the scientific decision-making war. This ensures that every step of decision-making is safe and controllable, thus maximizing the scientific and precise decision-making in war.","The article discusses the concept of ""gray-scale cognition"" versus ""black and white decision-making"" in the context of military decision-making. Gray-scale cognition is a method of considering all possible options and their uncertainties, whereas black and white decision-making focuses on choosing between two clear options. Military commanders should maintain a gray-scale cognition during analysis and planning, but ultimately make decisions using black and white decision-making. This ensures that decisions are not only flexible but also firm, and risks are minimized. The article also highlights the importance of reserving a buffer zone, which is a strategy that aims to minimize risk and ensure controllability of the outcome. A good example of the application of gray-scale cognition can be seen in the U.S. military's reaction to the Pacific War."
学习宣传贯彻党的二十大精神丨加快构建新发展格局 着力推动高质量发展 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：王德蓉 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2023-02-13 07:36:34 0,加快构建新发展格局 着力推动高质量发展 ■王德蓉 发展是党执政兴国的第一要务。没有坚实的物质技术基础，就不可能全面建成社会主义现代化强国。习近平总书记在中共中央政治局第二次集体学习时强调，加快构建新发展格局，增强发展的安全性主动权。未来五年是全面建设社会主义现代化国家开局起步的关键时期，党的二十大对加快构建新发展格局、着力推动高质量发展作出了战略部署，我们一定要深入学习、全面领会、贯彻落实。 一 党的二十大报告指出：“高质量发展是全面建设社会主义现代化国家的首要任务。”这是在深入分析我国发展新的历史条件和阶段、全面认识和把握我国现代化建设实践历程以及各国现代化建设一般规律的基础上，作出的一个具有全局性、长远性和战略性意义的重大判断。 所谓高质量发展，就是能够很好满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要的发展，是体现新发展理念的发展，是创新成为第一动力、协调成为内生特点、绿色成为普遍形态、开放成为必由之路、共享成为根本目的的发展。实现高质量发展，是中国式现代化的本质要求之一。从供给看，高质量发展应该实现产业体系比较完整，生产组织方式网络化智能化，创新力、需求捕捉力、品牌影响力、核心竞争力强，产品和服务质量高。从需求看，高质量发展应该不断满足人民群众个性化、多样化升级的需求，这种需求又引领供给体系和结构的变化，供给变革又不断催生新的需求。从投入产出看，高质量发展应该不断提高劳动效率、资本效率、土地效率、资源效率、环境效率，不断提升科技进步贡献率，不断提高全要素生产率。从分配看，高质量发展应该实现投资有回报、企业有利润、员工有收入、政府有税收，并且充分反映各自按市场评价的贡献。从宏观经济循环看，高质量发展应该实现生产、流通、分配、消费循环通畅，国民经济重大比例关系和空间布局比较合理，经济发展比较平稳，不出现大的起落。总之，只有经济总量继续增长和发展质量效益进一步提高，我国的社会事业发展、文化事业繁荣、生态环境美好、国际地位提升、安全能力增强等各方面建设的物质条件才能不断得到充实，全面建成社会主义现代化强国才能有更为坚实的物质技术基础。 当前，我国发展不平衡不充分问题仍然突出，经济发展中的矛盾和问题集中体现在推进高质量发展还有许多卡点瓶颈。在全面建设社会主义现代化国家的新征程上，我们要认真学习领会高质量发展的深刻内涵和实践要求，坚持党对经济工作的全面领导，确保执行党中央战略决策不偏向、不变通、不走样；坚持以人民为中心，让发展成果更多更公平惠及全体人民；坚持完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，不断提高发展质量和效益；坚持问题导向和目标导向，把解决实际问题作为打开工作局面的突破口；坚持向改革开放创新要动力，不断解放和发展社会生产力；坚持统筹好发展和安全，实现高质量发展和高水平安全的良性互动，确保全面建设社会主义现代化国家顺利推进。 二 习总书记强调：“加快构建新发展格局，是立足实现第二个百年奋斗目标、统筹发展和安全作出的战略决策，是把握未来发展主动权的战略部署。”只有加快构建新发展格局，才能夯实我国经济发展的根基、增强发展的安全性稳定性，才能在各种可以预见和难以预见的狂风暴雨、惊涛骇浪中增强我国的生存力、竞争力、发展力、持续力，确保中华民族伟大复兴进程不被迟滞甚至中断，胜利实现全面建成社会主义现代化强国的目标。 从根本上说，构建新发展格局是适应我国发展新阶段要求、塑造国际合作和竞争新优势的必然选择。改革开放前，我国经济以国内循环为主，进出口占国民经济的比重很小。改革开放后，我们打开国门，扩大对外贸易和吸引外资。特别是2001年加入世界贸易组织后，我国深度参与国际分工，融入国际大循环，形成市场和资源“两头在外”的发展格局，对我们抓住经济全球化机遇，快速提升经济实力、改善人民生活发挥了重要作用。近几年，随着全球政治经济环境变化，逆全球化趋势加剧，有的国家大搞单边主义、保护主义，市场和资源“两头在外”的国际大循环动能明显减弱，而国内大循环活力日益强劲。面对国内外环境变化带来的新矛盾新挑战，必须进一步把发展立足点放在国内，更多依靠国内市场实现经济发展。 构建新发展格局是事关全局的系统性、深层次变革，是立足当前、着眼长远的战略谋划。近年来，构建新发展格局扎实推进，思想共识不断凝聚、工作基础不断夯实、政策制度不断完善，取得了一些成效，但全面建成新发展格局还任重道远。要坚持问题导向和系统观念，着力破除制约加快构建新发展格局的主要矛盾和问题，全面深化改革，推进实践创新、制度创新，不断扬优势、补短板、强弱项。我们要从全局高度准确把握加快构建新发展格局的战略构想，牢牢把握工作着力点。要搞好统筹扩大内需和深化供给侧结构性改革，形成需求牵引供给、供给创造需求的更高水平动态平衡，实现国民经济良性循环；加快科技自立自强步伐，解决“卡脖子”问题，推动发挥科技在畅通国内大循环、塑造我国在国际大循环中新优势的关键作用；促进内外产业深度融合，打造自主可控、安全可靠、竞争力强的现代化产业体系，稳固国内大循环的主体地位、增强在国际大循环中的带动能力；全面推进城乡、区域协调发展，提高国内大循环的覆盖面；进一步深化改革开放，增强国内外大循环的动力和活力；牢牢守住安全发展这条底线，为构建新发展格局提供重要保障。 党的二十大报告提出，要把实施扩大内需战略同深化供给侧结构性改革有机结合起来，增强国内大循环内生动力和可靠性，提升国际循环质量和水平。新征程上，加快构建以国内大循环为主体、国内国际双循环相互促进的新发展格局，要找准实施扩大内需战略同深化供给侧结构性改革的有机结合点，围绕着力推动国内国际双循环相互促进、保持宏观经济稳定、增强微观主体活力、提高全要素生产率、提升产业链供应链韧性和安全水平、推进城乡融合和区域协调发展以及防范化解系统性风险等方面，系统有力精准施策，确保取得实效。 三 在党的二十大报告中，习总书记明确提出新时代新征程加快构建新发展格局、着力推动高质量发展五个方面的重点任务和重大举措，具有重要指导意义。 构建高水平社会主义市场经济体制。要坚持“两个毫不动摇”，充分发挥市场在资源配置中的决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用。提升国有企业核心竞争力，促进民营经济发展壮大，支持中小微企业发展。深化“简政放权、放管结合、优化服务”改革，优化营商环境。构建全国统一大市场，深化要素市场化改革，建设高标准市场体系。健全宏观经济治理体系，建设现代财政金融体系。 建设现代化产业体系。要坚持把发展经济的着力点放在实体经济上，推进新型工业化，加快建设制造强国、质量强国、航天强国、交通强国、网络强国、数字中国。重点在巩固优势产业领先地位、推动战略性新兴产业融合集群发展、构建优质高效的服务业新体系、建设高效顺畅的流通体系、加快发展数字经济、构建现代化基础设施体系等方面扎实推进现代化产业体系建设。 全面推进乡村振兴。全面建设社会主义现代化国家，最艰巨最繁重的任务仍然在农村。党的二十大报告提出，要加快建设农业强国，扎实推动乡村产业、人才、文化、生态、组织振兴。加快建设农业强国，就要推进耕地保护建设全方位加强，推进农业科技装备全领域突破，推进农业绿色发展全过程转型，推进农业社会化服务全环节覆盖，推进农业产业全链条升级，推进农业对外合作全方位展开。 促进区域协调发展。构建优势互补、高质量发展的区域经济布局和国土空间体系，要深入实施区域协调发展战略，在发展中促进相对平衡；深入实施区域重大战略，增强高质量发展的重要动力源；深入实施主体功能区战略，完善国土空间体系；深入实施新型城镇化战略，提升发展优势区域综合承载能力；加快建设海洋强国，拓展海洋经济发展空间。 推进高水平对外开放。稳步扩大规则、规制、管理、标准等制度型开放，依托我国超大规模市场优势，吸引全球资源要素。加快建设贸易强国，推动货物贸易优化升级，创新服务贸易发展机制，发展数字贸易。合理缩减外资准入负面清单，依法保护外商投资权益，营造市场化、法治化、国际化一流营商环境。加快建设海南自由贸易港，实施自由贸易试验区提升战略，扩大面向全球的高标准自由贸易区网络。推动共建“一带一路”高质量发展，构建互利共赢、多元平衡、安全高效的开放型经济体系。 （作者单位：中央党史和文献研究院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230214192201/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201178.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230214183745/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201178.html,2023-02-15 0:00:00,"Study, Publicize and Implement the Spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress丨Speed up the Construction of New Development Patterns and Strive to Promote High-Quality Development Source：China Military Network - PLA Daily Author：Wang Delong Responsibility：Guo Yanfei 2023-02-13 07:36:34 0","Accelerating the construction of a new development pattern and making efforts to promote high-quality development ■ Wang Delong Development is the first priority of the Party's administration and development of the country. Without a solid material and technological foundation, it is impossible to fully build a strong modern socialist country. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during the second collective study of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee that it is important to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern and enhance the security initiative of development. The next five years is a critical period for the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country, the 20th CPC National Congress has made a strategic plan for accelerating the construction of a new development pattern and striving to promote high-quality development, and we must study it in depth, comprehend it comprehensively, and implement it. I The report of the 20th CPC National Congress points out that ""high-quality development is the primary task of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way."" This is a major judgment of overall, long-term and strategic significance based on an in-depth analysis of the new historical conditions and stages of China's development, a comprehensive understanding and grasp of the practical history of China's modernization and the general laws of modernization in all countries. The so-called high-quality development is the development that can well meet the people's growing needs for a better life, the development that embodies the new development concept, the development in which innovation becomes the first driving force, coordination becomes an endogenous feature, green becomes a universal form, openness becomes a necessary path, and sharing becomes the fundamental purpose. Achieving high-quality development is one of the essential requirements of Chinese-style modernization. From the viewpoint of supply, high-quality development should realize a relatively complete industrial system, networked and intelligent production organization, strong innovation, demand-capturing power, brand influence, core competitiveness, and high product and service quality. From the demand point of view, high-quality development should constantly meet the people's individualized and diversified upgraded demand, which in turn leads to changes in the supply system and structure, and supply changes constantly generate new demand. In terms of inputs and outputs, high-quality development should continuously improve labor efficiency, capital efficiency, land efficiency, resource efficiency, and environmental efficiency, continuously improve the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress, and continuously improve total factor productivity. From the perspective of distribution, high-quality development should realize returns on investment, profits for enterprises, income for employees, and tax revenue for the government, and fully reflect their respective contributions as evaluated by the market. From the perspective of the macroeconomic cycle, high-quality development should realize a smooth cycle of production, circulation, distribution, and consumption, with the major proportionality and spatial layout of the national economy being more reasonable, and economic development being relatively stable, without major ups and downs. In short, only if the total economy continues to grow and the quality and efficiency of development is further improved, the material conditions for the development of social undertakings, the prosperity of cultural undertakings, a better ecological environment, the enhancement of international status, and the strengthening of security capabilities in China will continue to be enriched, and the building of a strong socialist modernized country in all aspects will have a more solid material and technological foundation. At present, the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development in China is still prominent, and the contradictions and problems in economic development are centered on the fact that there are still many obstacles and bottlenecks in promoting high-quality development. On the new journey of building a socialist modernized country in all aspects, we should seriously study and understand the profound connotation and practical requirements of high-quality development, adhere to the Party's overall leadership of the economic work, and ensure that the implementation of the Party's Central Committee's strategic decisions will not be biased, unaltered or out of line; adhere to the people-centered approach, so that the fruits of development will benefit the whole people in a more and more equitable manner; adhere to the complete, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the new concept of development, and continuously improve the quality and effectiveness of development; adhere to the issue-oriented approach, and implement the new concept of development. development quality and efficiency; adhere to the problem-oriented and goal-oriented approach, and take the solution of practical problems as a breakthrough to open up the work situation; adhere to the reform, opening up and innovation to demand power, and continuously liberate and develop the social productive forces; adhere to the integration of development and security, and realize the benign interaction between high-quality development and high-level security, to ensure that the construction of a socialist modernized country in all aspects is smoothly advanced. Secondly, General Secretary Xi emphasized that ""accelerating the construction of a new development pattern is a strategic decision based on realizing the second hundred-year goal, integrating development and security, and a strategic plan to seize the initiative for future development."" Only by accelerating the construction of a new development pattern can we strengthen the foundation of China's economic development, enhance the security and stability of development, enhance our country's survivability, competitiveness, development and sustainability amidst all kinds of foreseen and unforeseen storms and waves, ensure that the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will not be delayed or even interrupted, and triumphantly achieve the goal of comprehensively building a socialist modernized power. Fundamentally speaking, building a new development pattern is an inevitable choice to meet the requirements of the new stage of China's development and to shape new advantages in international cooperation and competition. Before the reform and opening up, China's economy was dominated by the domestic cycle, and imports and exports accounted for a small proportion of the national economy. After the reform and opening up, we opened our doors to expand foreign trade and attract foreign investment. Especially after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, our country has deeply participated in the international division of labor, integrated into the international cycle, and formed the development pattern of ""both markets and resources"", which has played an important role in seizing the opportunities of economic globalization, rapidly improving economic strength and people's lives. In recent years, with the changes in the global political and economic environment, the trend of anti-globalization has intensified, and some countries are engaged in unilateralism and protectionism, the momentum of the international cycle of markets and resources is obviously weakening, while the vitality of the domestic cycle is getting stronger and stronger. In the face of new contradictions and challenges brought about by changes in the domestic and foreign environments, it is necessary to further focus development on the domestic level and rely more on the domestic market to realize economic development. The construction of a new development pattern is a systematic and deep-level change that affects the whole situation, and is a strategic plan based on the present and focusing on the long term. In recent years, the construction of a new development pattern of solid progress, the ideological consensus continues to cohesion, the work of the foundation continues to consolidate, the policy system continues to improve, and has achieved some results, but comprehensively build a new development pattern is still a long way to go. We should adhere to the problem-oriented and systematic concept, focus on eliminating the main contradictions and problems that constrain the acceleration of the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepen the reform, and promote practical and systemic innovation, and continue to raise the advantages, make up for the shortcomings, and strengthen the weaknesses. We need to accurately grasp the strategic concept of accelerating the construction of a new development pattern from the overall height, and firmly grasp the focus of work. We should do a good job of integrating the expansion of domestic demand and deepening the supply-side structural reform, forming a higher level of dynamic balance between demand-driven supply and supply-created demand, and realizing the virtuous cycle of the national economy; accelerating the pace of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement, solving the problem of the ""choke point"", and promoting the key role of science and technology in smoothing out the domestic cycle and shaping China's new advantages in the international cycle; promoting domestic and international industrialization; and promoting the development of the domestic and international industries. Promote the deep integration of internal and external industries, create a modernized industrial system that is independently controllable, safe, reliable, and competitive, so as to solidify the main position of the domestic macrocycle and enhance the driving capacity in the international macrocycle; comprehensively promote the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and regions, so as to improve the coverage of the domestic macrocycle; further deepen the reform and opening up, so as to enhance the impetus and vitality of the domestic and international macrocycle; and firmly protect the bottom line of safety and development, so as to contribute to the construction of a new macrocycle. development as the bottom line, and provide an important guarantee for building a new development pattern. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress proposes to organically combine the implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand with the deepening of supply-side structural reform, enhance the endogenous power and reliability of the domestic macro-cycle, and improve the quality and level of the international cycle. On the new journey, to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern with the domestic macro-cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double-cycle promoting each other, it is necessary to identify the organic combination of the implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand and the deepening of the supply-side structural reform, and to focus on striving to promote the mutual promotion of the domestic and international double-cycle, maintain macroeconomic stability, enhance the vitality of the micro-entrepreneurs, improve total factor productivity, improve the resilience and security level of the industrial chain supply chain, promote urban-rural integration and coordinated regional development, as well as preventing and resolving systemic risks, etc., systematically, forcefully and precisely applying measures to ensure the achievement of practical results. In the report of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi clearly put forward five key tasks and major initiatives to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern and strive for high-quality development in the new era and new journey, which are of great significance. Build a high-level socialist market economic system. It is necessary to adhere to the ""two unwavering"", give full play to the decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources, and better play the role of the government. Enhance the core competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, promote the development and growth of the private economy, and support the development of small, medium and micro enterprises. We will deepen the reform of ""simplifying government, delegating authority, combining administration and optimizing services"" and optimize the business environment. It will build a unified national market, deepen the reform of factor marketization, and construct a high-standard market system. Improve the macroeconomic governance system and build a modern financial system. Build a modernized industrial system. It is necessary to insist on putting the focus of economic development on the real economy, promoting new industrialization, and accelerating the construction of a strong manufacturing country, a strong quality country, a strong aerospace country, a strong transportation country, a strong network country, and a digital China. We will focus on consolidating the leading position of advantageous industries, promoting the integrated cluster development of strategic emerging industries, building a new system of high-quality and efficient service industry, constructing an efficient and smooth circulation system, accelerating the development of the digital economy, and constructing a modernized infrastructure system to solidly push forward the construction of a modernized industrial system. Comprehensively promoting rural revitalization. The most arduous and burdensome task in comprehensively building a modernized socialist country remains in the countryside. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress proposes to accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country and solidly promote the revitalization of rural industries, talents, culture, ecology and organizations. To accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, it is necessary to promote the all-round strengthening of the construction of arable land protection, promote breakthroughs in the whole field of agricultural science and technology equipment, promote the transformation of the whole process of agricultural green development, promote the coverage of the whole link of agricultural socialized services, promote the upgrading of the whole chain of the agricultural industry, and promote the all-round unfolding of the agricultural foreign cooperation. Promote coordinated regional development. To build a regional economic layout and land space system with complementary advantages and high-quality development, it is necessary to deeply implement the strategy of coordinated regional development, and promote relative balance in development; deeply implement major regional strategies, and enhance the important power source of high-quality development; deeply implement the strategy of main functional zones, and improve the land space system; deeply implement the strategy of new-type townships and cities, and enhance the comprehensive carrying capacity of the regions with superiority in development; and accelerate the construction of a Marine Power, expanding the space for the development of the marine economy. Promote high-level opening to the outside world. Steadily expand the systematic opening up of rules, regulations, management, standards and other systems, and rely on China's advantage of a super-sized market to attract global resources and elements. Accelerate the construction of a trade powerhouse, promote the optimization and upgrading of trade in goods, innovate the development mechanism of trade in services, and develop digital trade. We will reasonably reduce the negative list for foreign investment access, protect the rights and interests of foreign investors in accordance with the law, and create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rule of law-oriented and internationalized. Accelerate the construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, implement the strategy of upgrading the Pilot Free Trade Zone, and expand the network of high-standard free trade zones facing the world. Promote the high-quality development of the ""Belt and Road"", and build a win-win, diversified and balanced, safe and efficient open economic system.

涵养人格魅力是塑造形象成就事业的关键一环 来源：中国军网 作者：傅凌艳 责任编辑：刘上靖 2023-02-16 17:34:00 0,人格魅力，是人的信仰、气质、品德、才智等融汇而成的感召力量。具有真正人格魅力的党员干部，是通过自身良好的综合素质和行为表现，其言有号召力、其行有带动力、其德有感染力，不断提高自己的非权力影响力，用人格力量凝聚人心，鼓舞斗志，团结和带领团队事半功倍地干成事、干好事。 提升能力水平，摒弃虚功清淡。 才情若春水，风日俱洒然。党员干部拥有真理的力量、思想的力量，才会技高一筹，以才服人。党员干部要善于从政治上看问题，站稳立场、把准方向。要善于运用马克思主义立场、观点和方法，透过现象看到本质及其产生的原因，增强认识规律、找准规律、把握规律的能力，提高运用规律的水平，从而在具体工作中增强主动性和有效性。面对新问题、新矛盾、新形势，党员干部要有本领恐慌，增强学习紧迫感。要保持“空杯心态”，坚持向实践学、向群众学、向同事学，不断涵养浩然之气、汲取精神养分。要大兴调研之风，坚持把民情民意民智作为科学决策、完善政策、改进工作、推动发展的“活性炭”，及时深入基层调查研究，把实际情况摸清楚，把工作中的短板弱项搞清楚，在抓落实时找准主攻方向，在高质量跨越式发展中赢得优势、赢得主动、赢得未来。 淬炼政德“内功”，发挥“表率效应”。 人无德不立，官无德不为。政德是社会道德建设的重要风向标，是党员干部必须修炼的“内功”。作为党员干部，面对错综复杂的内外环境和艰巨繁重的发展任务，要始终坚定理想信念，站稳政治立场，把全心全意为人民服务作为一切工作的出发点，做到问计于民、问需于民，为群众办实事、做好事、解难事，努力当好群众的知心人、暖心人、贴心人。要规范自身德行，严格要求和约束自己的行为品德，从自身做起，从小事入手，做老实人、老实做人。凡是要求下属做到的，自己必须首先做到；禁止别人做的，自己坚决不做，用实际行动在人民群众中树立良好形象。 常怀“底线思维”，涵养“归零心态”。 如果说才华和政德是衡量一个人成长进步的标尺，那么心态就是决定这个人提升修为的维度。人生的道路不可能一帆风顺，困难挫折是人生的一门“必修课”。人生不如意事常八九，有道是“最完美的产品在广告里，最完美的爱情在小说里，最完美的婚姻在梦境里”。如果求全责备，倘若心为物役，患得患失，就会悲观绝望，窒息心智，人生道路就会举步维艰。因此，要保持一种不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步的心态，用一分为二的观点看问题，成功时及时总结经验做法，失败后应正确分析原因，寻求解决问题的方法和途径，做到胜不骄、败不馁。党员干部要有“努力向上”的拼劲，也要有“船到桥头自然直”的淡然，不以物喜，不以己悲，以一颗平常心正确看待一切得失。 “做官先做人”。领导的威望并不是建立在下属、群众避而远之和心怀恐惧的基础上，而是建立在真诚信任、尊重信服的基础上。因此，好品德是党员干部干事成事的重要基础，群众认可、同事认可、上级认可，才是党员干部真正的品格和能力的体现。 （作者单位：解放军总医院第七医学中心政治工作部）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230217205757/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201955.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230217174342/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201955.html,2023-02-18 0:00:00,Cultivating charisma is a key part of shaping an image to achieve a career Source: China Military Network Author: Fu Lingyan Editor in Chief: Liu Shangjing 2023-02-16 17:34:00 0,"Personality charisma, is a person's faith, temperament, character, talent and other fusion of the power of inspiration.

Political ethics is an important wind vane of social moral construction, party members and cadres must cultivate the ""inner strength"". As party members and cadres, in the face of the intricate internal and external environment and the arduous task of development, we must always be firm in our ideals and beliefs, stand firm in our political stance, serve the people wholeheartedly as the starting point for all work, to do the people, ask the people, ask for the people, for the masses to do practical work, do good work, solve difficult problems, and strive to be a good people's knowledgable, warm-hearted and caring people. To regulate their own moral behavior, strict requirements and constraints on their own behavior and moral character, starting from themselves, from small things, do honest people, honest people. Where subordinates are required to do, they must first do; prohibit others to do, they are determined not to do, with practical action in the people to establish a good image.

大思政课丨红色文旅实践如何赋能“大思政课”建设 来源：人民论坛网 作者：龚曦 罗俊祺 责任编辑：于海洋 2023-02-01 17:57:53 1,进入新时代以来，满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要，建设美丽中国，已经成为时代发展的主旋律。在物质条件不断得到满足的基础上，对“美”的追求已经是一种更深层次的内在需求。2018年9月，习近平总书记在全国教育大会上强调：“要全面加强和改进学校美育，坚持以美育人、以文化人，提高学生审美和人文素养。”美育和思想政治教育都在落实立德树人根本任务中发挥着重要作用。旅游从本质上说是一种审美活动。旅游体验正是能够提升个体欣赏美、体验美和创造美能力的活动，其本质是美育的升华和展现。 近年来，多元化、趣味性的呈现方式让红色文旅有了新的“打开方式”。红色旅游已经成为年轻人了解革命历史、缅怀革命先烈、传承红色基因的重要方式。湖南师范大学结合旅游学科专业特色，以红色文旅实践为依托，紧密联动“思政小课堂”与“社会大课堂”，开展了一系列以红色美育为主旨的“大思政课”教育实践活动，带领学生深入红色资源景区挖掘红色革命故事，将红色故事与时代主旋律相结合，创作了一系列红色文旅美育作品，实现了教师主导与学生主体的良性互动、理论阐释与实践探索的互融互通、教育内容与教育形式的双向建构，探索了“感知凝聚——诠释赋意——内化认同”具象化红色美育“大思政课”的建设路径，切实用好红色资源，讲好红色故事，搞好红色教育。 感知凝聚，助推红色文旅实践见行见效 美育是审美教育，具有形象直观、生动活泼的特点，注重从“美”的感性层面浸润学生心灵。今天的湖湘大地，遍布着革命先烈的红色足迹，宛若一座没有围墙的革命历史博物馆，其传递出来的强烈的精神内核和情感特质代表着红色精神的实质，从而产生深厚的美育价值，具有很大的理论价值和现实意义。 湖南师范大学充分发挥国家级一流本科建设点优势，组织学生前往伟人故里韶山、“半条被子”故事发生地汝城沙洲村、将军故里平江、黄埔分校旧址武冈、红军长征湖南段等一批红色景区开展红色文旅调研实践，深入挖掘地方红色故事与红色精神，借助旅游场域中丰富多元的审美体验，感知红色故事场景，凝聚红色故事认同，鼓励学生从中感受自然美、文化美和艺术美，从形式美育走向实质美育，推动红色文旅美育见行见效。 诠释赋意，绘声绘色妙用可视化党史故事 “大思政课”之大，旨在体现协同效应，要实现“教”与“学”的双向互动、“道”与“器”的相互配合、“知”与“行”的有机统一。湖南师范大学将红色旅游与美育培育连接起来，注重挖掘艺术教育侧重培养学生的创造能力与感性思维的优势，一方面建有《“红色筑梦之旅”创意设计与实践》专思创精品课程，联通《从创意到创业》《红色旅游景区促销运营虚拟仿真实验》《酒店品牌建设与管理》等一批国家级、省级金课，形成“课程思政”群，开创“专业+思政+美学艺术”课程新模式，如通过红色旅游实践，引导学生共同创作可视化红色故事，用学生喜闻乐见的Vlog、H5、短视频等方式予以呈现。同时引导学生将学思践悟成效转化成红色文创设计、红色研学旅游路线开发等，在专业教学实践中讲好中华优秀传统文化、革命文化，尤其设计创作了《萝卜眼里长铜钱》《毛毯里的军民情》《赓续湘女魂》等一批可视、可爱、可亲的系列红色漫画作品，让红色故事“飞入寻常百姓家”。另一方面，学生在美育作品创作的过程中，进一步对革命故事、红色故事进行复盘，切实感知了解故事、事迹及其背后蕴含的精神价值，促进学生心灵与红色文化的沟通和交流，认同“实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦”这一主题主线，从青年群体的视角予以新时代的诠释与赋意，由此，学生在审美体验、环境熏陶、自我探索中习得美育知识、升华美育情感、提升审美能力、塑造健康人格。 内化认同，推动新时代党的创新理论入脑入心 所谓“以美培元”，就是通过美育培育学生非功利性审美，知行合一践行社会主义核心价值观，以期发挥好美育对丰富德育、增进智育、促进体育、改善劳育的重要作用。“思政课的本质是讲道理”。美育虽为隐性教育，但同样是情感升华、心智开启、性情养育的体验过程，两者融合互通，将抽象的理论具体化、生动化，提升思想政治教育实效，不断构建思政课高质量发展“大格局”。 湖南师范大学通过“美育+思政”方式着力培养创新人才，学生不仅自身在红色美育创作中提升理论修养，增进对新时代党的创新理论的认同感、亲近感，同时身体力行宣传推广，带动师生党员、团员青年志愿者进乡村、进社区、进田间、进学校，着力开展“四史”教育，涌现出了一批全国暑期社会实践优秀个人、中国大学生自强之星、湖南省优秀共青团员等学生典型，凝练的成果荣获第六届全国高校“礼敬中华优秀传统文化”特色展示项目、第六届中国青年志愿服务项目大赛银奖、入选2022年文化和旅游志愿服务典型案例等。更有一批红色文旅实践志愿者毕业后选择奔赴西藏、新疆，扎根湖南省偏远地区基层一线奉献青春，真正实现与“社会大课堂”结合起来。推进红色美育实践的课程思政群建设“立意高”、“格局大”，造就拔尖创新人才和服务区域经济社会发展，切实发挥了“大思政课”铸魂育人的作用。（作者：湖南师范大学 龚曦 罗俊祺） 【本文系2022年湖南省社会科学成果评审委员会课题《运用红色美育资源深化高校党史学习教育成效研究》(项目编号:XSP22YBC524) 、2021年湖南师范大学党建研究专项课题《基于红色美育的大学生党员培养教育创新研究》（编号20211220GX）阶段性研究成果】,https://web.archive.org/web/20230226214421/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215929.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230306015900/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/10215929.html,2023-02-27 0:00:00,"How the practice of red cultural tourism empowers the construction of ""big ideological and political class"" Source: People's Tribune.com Author: Gong Xi Luo Junqi Responsibility: Yu Haiyang 2023-02-01 17:57:53 1","Since entering the new era, meeting the people's growing needs for a better life and building a beautiful China have become the main theme of the times. On the basis of the continuous satisfaction of material conditions, the pursuit of ""beauty"" has become a deeper intrinsic demand.In September 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized at the National Education Conference that ""we should comprehensively strengthen and improve aesthetic education in schools, insist on educating people with beauty and culture, and improve students' aesthetic and humanistic literacy. aesthetic and humanistic literacy."" Both aesthetic education and ideological and political education play an important role in the implementation of the fundamental task of establishing morality. Tourism is essentially an aesthetic activity. Tourism experience is precisely the activity that can enhance the individual's ability to appreciate beauty, experience beauty and create beauty, and its essence is the sublimation and presentation of aesthetic education. In recent years, diversified and interesting presentation methods have given red cultural tourism a new ""open way"". Red tourism has become an important way for young people to understand revolutionary history, remember revolutionary martyrs and inherit the red gene. Hunan Normal University, combined with the professional characteristics of the tourism discipline, based on the practice of red tourism, closely linked with the ""small classroom of ideology and politics"" and ""social classroom"", carried out a series of ""big ideology and politics class"" with the main theme of red aesthetic education, and led the red tourism practice to the ""big ideology and politics class"". ""Educational and practical activities, leading students to go deep into the red resource scenic spots to excavate the red revolutionary stories, combining the red stories with the main theme of the times, and creating a series of red cultural and tourism aesthetic works, realizing the benign interaction between the teacher's leading role and the student's main role, the interplay between theoretical interpretation and practical exploration, and the bidirectional construction between educational content and educational forms, exploring the following Explore the construction of the ""big ideological and political class"" of visualizing red aesthetic education by ""perceiving cohesion--interpreting meaning--internalizing identity"". It explores the construction of ""Great Civic and Political Education"" which visualizes the red aesthetic education ""and internalizes the identity"", makes good use of the red resources, tells good red stories and improves red education. Perception of cohesion, boosting the practice of red cultural tourism to see the effect of aesthetic education is aesthetic education, with the image of intuitive, lively features, focusing on the ""beauty"" of the perceptual level of infiltration of the student's mind. Today's Hunan land is covered with the red footprints of revolutionary martyrs, just like a museum of revolutionary history without walls, which conveys a strong spiritual core and emotional qualities on behalf of the essence of the red spirit, thus generating a profound aesthetic education value, with great theoretical value and practical significance. Hunan Normal University gives full play to the advantages of national first-class undergraduate construction sites, organizing students to go to Shaoshan, the hometown of great men, Rucheng Shazhou Village, the story of ""half a quilt"", Pingjiang, the hometown of the generals, the old site of the Whampoa branch school, Wugang, the Red Army's Long March in Hunan, and a number of other red scenic areas to carry out research and practice of the red cultural and tourism research, and to deeply excavate the red stories and red spirit, with the help of tourism in the field of red stories and red spirit. Red spirit, with the help of rich and diversified aesthetic experience in the tourism field, perceive the red story scene, gather the red story identity, encourage students to feel the natural beauty, cultural beauty and artistic beauty, from the form of aesthetic education to the substance of aesthetic education, and promote the red cultural and tourism aesthetic education to see the effect of action.

Hunan Normal University connects red tourism with aesthetic cultivation, focusing on tapping the advantages of art education focusing on cultivating students' creativity and perceptual thinking, on the one hand, there is a """"Red Dream Building Tour"" creative design and practice"" special Si Chuang boutique course, linking the ""From Creativity to Entrepreneurship"" ""Red Tourism Scenic Spot Promotion and Operation Virtual Simulation Experiments A number of national and provincial gold courses, such as ""Hotel Brand Building and Management"", have formed a group of ""Course Civics"", and created a new mode of ""Professional + Civics + Aesthetics and Art"", such as through the practice of red tourism, guiding the students to co-create visualization of the red story, and using the Vlog which is popular among the students. For example, through the practice of red tourism, students are guided to co-create visualized red stories, which are presented in Vlog, H5, short videos and other ways that are popular among students. At the same time, students are guided to transform the results of learning, thinking, practicing and understanding into the design of red cultural creations and the development of red study tour routes, etc., and speak well of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and revolutionary culture in their professional teaching practice. In particular, they have designed and created a number of visual, lovely and relatable series of red cartoons such as ""Copper Coins Growing in Radish Eyes"", ""Military and Civilian Love in Blanket"", ""Continuation of the Xiangnian Women's Soul"" and other red cartoons, so that the red stories can be brought into common people's homes. Let the red story fly into the common people's home"". On the other hand, in the process of creation of art works, students further review the revolutionary stories and red stories, and effectively perceive and understand the stories, deeds and the spiritual values behind them, so as to promote the communication and exchange between students' minds and red culture, and to identify with the theme of ""Realizing the Great Revival of the Chinese Dream of the Chinese Nation"", and to express their views on the new era from the perspective of young people. From the perspective of youth groups, they are given the interpretation and meaning of the new era, so that students can acquire knowledge of aesthetic education, sublimate the emotion of aesthetic education, improve their aesthetic ability and shape a healthy personality through aesthetic experience, environmental cultivation and self-exploration. The new era of the Party's innovative theories into the heart of the so-called ""beauty cultivation"" is to cultivate non-utilitarian aesthetics through the beauty of the students, the unity of knowledge and practice of the core socialist values, in order to play a good role in the beauty of the enrichment of moral education, enhancement of the intellectual education, the promotion of physical education, and the improvement of the important role of the labor education.

党的自我革命永远在路上 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：凌胜银 韩 飞 陈茂霞 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-01 06:36:03 0,党的自我革命永远在路上 ■陆军党的创新理论研究中心 党的二十大报告指出：“全面从严治党永远在路上，党的自我革命永远在路上，决不能有松劲歇脚、疲劳厌战的情绪，必须持之以恒推进全面从严治党，深入推进新时代党的建设新的伟大工程，以党的自我革命引领社会革命。”这一重要论述，彰显了我们党一以贯之坚持自我革命的坚定决心，标志着我们党对自身建设规律和执政规律的认识达到了新高度。新征程上，我们要以自我革命的政治勇气，着力解决我们党自身存在的突出问题，更好带领人民实现中华民族伟大复兴的梦想。 一 马克思主义政党夺取政权不容易，巩固政权更不容易；只要马克思主义执政党不出问题，社会主义国家就出不了大问题，我们就能够跳出“其兴也勃焉，其亡也忽焉”的历史周期率。面对错综复杂的国际形势、艰巨繁重的国内改革发展稳定任务，我们党要做到自身不出问题，就必须勇于进行自我革命。 党的百年历史经验的深刻昭示。党的十九届六中全会强调，“自我革命精神是党永葆青春活力的强大支撑”。这是对党百年奋斗历史经验的科学总结，深刻揭示了党历经千锤百炼更加朝气蓬勃的奥秘所在。百年风雨征程，我们党能够从仅有50多名党员发展成为拥有9600多万名党员、领导着14亿多人口大国、具有重大全球影响力的世界第一大执政党，在一次次血雨腥风中绝境重生，在一次次山重水复中迎来柳暗花明，很重要的原因是永不停歇地进行激浊扬清的自我革命。从一定意义上讲，一部百年党史就是一部不断自我革命的历史。这昭示我们，党的自我革命须臾不容懈怠，只有一刻不停地推进党的自我革命，才能确保党永远不变质、不变色、不变味。 永葆马克思主义政党本色的内在要求。马克思主义政党是无产阶级的先锋队，先进性和纯洁性是无产阶级政党的本质属性。如何永葆先进性和纯洁性，这是我们党作为大党强党必须回答好、解决好的一个根本性问题。实践一再告诫我们，马克思主义政党的先进性和纯洁性不是一成不变的，过去先进纯洁并不等于现在先进纯洁，现在先进纯洁并不等于永远先进纯洁，必须在不断自我革命中锻造而成。推进党的自我革命，决不是一时的要求，决不能有松劲歇脚、疲劳厌战的情绪，决不能有初见成效就万事大吉的念头，必须以彻底的革命精神和坚决的革命勇气，持之以恒滤杂质，锲而不舍清毒素，毫不懈怠袪痼疾，久久为功才能见成效。 新的赶考路上交出优异答卷的必然选择。当前，党带领人民踏上了实现第二个百年奋斗目标新的赶考之路。这条路，既是一条复兴图强的逐梦圆梦之路，也是一条“雄关漫道真如铁”的砥砺前行之路，更是一条“踏平坎坷成大道”的披荆斩棘之路。新征程上，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开，面对来自外部随时可能升级的打压遏制，面对风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验，全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，关键在党。只有始终保持永不懈怠的精神状态和一往无前的奋斗姿态，毫不动摇把党建设得更加坚强有力，才能化风高浪急为风平浪静，变惊涛骇浪为乘风破浪，推动中华民族伟大复兴号巨轮乘风破浪、扬帆远航，向历史和人民交出优异答卷。 二 勇于自我革命，是我们党最鲜明的品格，也是我们党最大的优势。我们党作为世界上最大的马克思主义执政党，要始终赢得人民拥护、巩固长期执政地位，必须时刻保持解决大党独有难题的清醒和坚定。 把党的自我革命贯穿伟大事业全程的决心坚韧不拔。习主席指出：“世界上最可怕的敌人从来是自己。我们党取得了举世瞩目的成就，现在更需要‘愈大愈惧，愈强愈恐’的态度。”越是长期执政，越不能丢掉马克思主义政党的本色，越不能忘记党的初心使命，越不能丧失自我革命精神。当前，全面建设社会主义现代化国家开局起步，中国发展的政治优势、制度优势日益凸显，党员干部中容易出现承平日久、精神懈怠的心态，容易进入不思进取、贪图享乐的状态，容易陷入忘记初心、迷失方向的泥潭。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，警醒全党千万不能在一片喝彩声、赞扬声中失去了斗争精神，必须以“千磨万击还坚劲”的革命精神和“不破楼兰终不还”的革命斗志，把党的自我革命坚定不移推进下去。 以党的自我革命引领社会革命的意志坚不可摧。推进伟大社会革命，是我们党的历史使命所在；推进伟大自我革命，是完成历史使命的必然要求。推进自我革命，必须同社会革命的大趋势贯通起来，在深入把握历史规律和社会大势基础上，按照社会革命的必然要求自省自觉进行。新时代，我们党领导人民进行伟大社会革命，涵盖领域的广泛性、触及利益格局调整的深刻性、涉及矛盾和问题的尖锐性、突破体制机制障碍的艰巨性、进行伟大斗争形势的复杂性，都是前所未有的。这对我们党以自我革命引领社会革命的坚强意志和驾驭能力提出很高要求。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，正是主动适应这一战略要求的前瞻之举，要求党必须强化自我革命的迫切性持久性，直面正在发生深刻变化的党情、国情、世情，以“为有牺牲多壮志”的英雄气概和“狭路相逢勇者胜”的斗争精神，使党在革命性锻造中更加坚强、更有活力，为夺取伟大社会革命新胜利提供坚强保证。 将反腐败这个最彻底的自我革命进行到底的定力坚如磐石。党的二十大报告指出：“反腐败是最彻底的自我革命。”反腐败斗争关系民心这个最大的政治，是一场输不起也不能输的重大政治斗争，这场斗争极其复杂、极其艰难，容不得丝毫退让妥协。只要存在腐败问题产生的土壤和条件，反腐败斗争就一刻不能停，必须永远吹响冲锋号。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，意味着我们党高度重视腐败的顽固性和危害性，新征程上对腐败会始终保持零容忍的力度、零容忍的定力，更加有力遏增量、清存量，把不敢腐的强大震慑效能、不能腐的刚性制度约束、不想腐的思想教育优势融于一体，不断清除一切损害党的先进性和纯洁性的因素，不断清除一切侵蚀党的健康肌体的病毒，坚决打赢反腐败斗争攻坚战持久战，永葆党的旺盛生命力和强大战斗力。 三 新征程上，我们必须始终保持党的自我革命永远在路上的坚定执着，深入贯彻新时代党的建设总要求，全面推进党的自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高，坚持不懈把全面从严治党向纵深推进。 增强自我革命的深厚底气。中国共产党之所以能够矢志不渝推进党的自我革命，根本原因在于我们党除了国家、民族、人民的利益，没有任何自己的特殊利益。“不私，而天下自公。”因为无私无畏，所以我们党才能摆脱一切利益集团、权势团体、特权阶层的围猎腐蚀，依靠自我革命跳出治乱兴衰的历史周期率。新征程上，继续把党的自我革命推向深入，必然要求全党始终牢记中国共产党是什么、要干什么这个根本问题，始终保持同人民群众的血肉联系，做最广大人民群众根本利益的代表者、捍卫者和实现者，为一以贯之推进党的自我革命提供强大力量源泉。 完善自我革命的制度规范。制度带有根本性、全局性、稳定性、长期性。坚定不移推进党的自我革命，既要有自我约束的内生动力，更要有制度约束的外部压力。党的二十大报告提出“完善党的自我革命制度规范体系”，这是着眼实现“全面从严治党永远在路上、党的自我革命永远在路上”作出的战略部署，为党在长期执政条件下不断开辟自我革命新境界提供了根本遵循。新征程上，我们要发挥好制度固根本、扬优势、补短板、利长远的作用，聚焦形成坚持真理、修正错误，发现问题、纠正偏差的长效机制，强化党的自我革命制度保障，健全党和国家监督体系，坚持制度治党、依规治党，以更加完备、协调、成熟的制度，确保党的自我革命常态化推进、可持续发展。 以严的基调强化正风肃纪。作风问题关系人心向背，关系执政党的生死存亡。党的作风是党的初心使命、性质宗旨的集中体现，严明作风纪律是推进自我革命的必由之路。作风建设永远在路上，全面从严治党永远在路上，党的自我革命永远在路上。新征程上持续推进自我革命，必须持之以恒加强作风建设，坚持严的基调不动摇，坚持思想从严、监督从严、执纪从严、治吏从严、作风从严和反腐从严有机统一，锲而不舍纠“四风”、扬新风，加固中央八项规定堤坝，反对特权思想和特权现象，把严的要求贯彻到管党治党全过程，以作风建设新成效赢得群众的信赖和支持，不断夯实党长期执政的政治根基。 （执笔：凌胜银、韩 飞、陈茂霞）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230301204613/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16204923.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230301055143/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16204923.html,2023-03-02 0:00:00,The Party's self-revolution is always on the road Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Ling Shengyin Han Fei Chen Maoxia Responsibility: Huang Min 2023-03-01 06:36:03 0,"The Party's self-revolution is always on the road ■ Army Party Innovation Theory Research Center The report of the Party's 20th National Congress points out, ""Comprehensively governing the Party strictly is always on the road, and the Party's self-revolution is always on the road, and there must not be any emotions of relaxation and rest, fatigue and boredom, and we must consistently push forward the comprehensively strict governance of the Party, and deeply push forward the Party's construction of the new era of the new great project, and lead the Party's self-revolution to a social revolution."" This important statement highlights the Party's firm determination to consistently adhere to the self-revolution, marking a new height in our Party's understanding of the laws of self-construction and the laws of governing. On the new journey, we should take the political courage of self-revolution, focus on solving the outstanding problems of the Party itself, and better lead the people to realize the dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is not easy for a Marxist party to seize power, and it is even more difficult to consolidate power; as long as the Marxist ruling party does not have any problems, the socialist country will not have any big problems, and we will be able to jump out of the historical cycle rate of ""its rise is also booming, and its demise is also sudden"". In the face of the intricate international situation and the arduous task of domestic reform, development and stabilization, the Party must have the courage to carry out a self-revolution if it wants to keep itself out of trouble. This is a profound indication of the Party's century-long historical experience. The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee emphasized that ""the spirit of self-revolution is a powerful support for the Party's eternal youthfulness and vitality."" This is a scientific summary of the historical experience of the Party's century-long struggle, which profoundly reveals the mystery of the Party's more vigorous vitality after thousands of years of refinement. A hundred years of wind and rain, our party can be developed from only 50 members to more than 96 million members, leading a large country with a population of more than 1.4 billion people, the world's first major ruling party with significant global influence, in the midst of bloody storms once reborn, in the midst of the mountains and waters ushered in the darkness of the day, a very important reason is to never stop to carry out the turbid and clear the self-revolution. In a certain sense, a hundred years of party history is a history of continuous self-revolution. This shows us that the party's self-revolution must not slacken off, and only by constantly promoting the party's self-revolution can we ensure that the party will never deteriorate in quality, color or taste. The inherent requirements of a Marxist political party. Marxist political party is the vanguard of the proletariat, and advancement and purity are the essential attributes of a proletarian political party. How to keep advanced and pure forever is a fundamental question that our party, as a big and strong party, must answer and solve. Practice has repeatedly warned us that the advancement and purity of Marxist political parties are not static; advanced and pure in the past does not equal advanced and pure now, and advanced and pure now does not equal advanced and pure forever, but must be forged in a continuous self-revolution. Promote the party's self-revolution, never a momentary requirement, there must be no relaxation, fatigue, fatigue, never have the first results on the idea of everything is fine, must be thoroughly revolutionary spirit and resolute revolutionary courage, perseverance and filter impurities, perseverance and clear toxins, do not slacken off to dispel chronic illnesses, and long-term efforts to see the results. The inevitable choice to deliver an excellent answer sheet on the new road to catch up. At present, the party led the people to embark on a new road to realize the second hundred years of struggle. This road is not only a road to revitalize and strengthen the dream, but also a road of ""the road is really like iron"", and a road of ""smooth out the bumps into the road"", the road of the thorns. On the new journey, the change of the world, the change of the times, the change of history is unfolding in an unprecedented way, in the face of the suppression and containment from the outside may escalate at any time, in the face of high winds and waves or even shocking waves of the major test, the construction of a comprehensive socialist modernization of the country, and comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the key in the party. Only by maintaining a never-relenting state of mind and an unrelenting attitude of struggle, and by unswervingly building the Party into a stronger and more powerful one, can we turn the high winds and waves into calm, and the frightening waves into a stormy sea, and promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to ride the stormy waves and sail away, and hand over an excellent answer to history and the people. Second, the courage to self-revolution is the most distinctive character of our Party and its greatest advantage. As the world's largest Marxist ruling party, our Party must always maintain the sobriety and firmness to solve the unique problems of large parties in order to win the support of the people and consolidate its long-term ruling position. The determination to carry the Party's self-revolution through the whole process of its great cause is tenacious. President Xi pointed out: ""The most formidable enemy in the world is never oneself. Our Party has made world-renowned achievements, but now it needs the attitude of 'the greater the fear, the stronger the fear' even more."" The longer it stays in power, the less it can lose its Marxist party character, the less it can forget the Party's original mission, and the less it can lose the spirit of self-revolution. At present, the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country started, China's development of the political advantages, institutional advantages are increasingly prominent, party members and cadres are prone to the emergence of Chengping day long, the spirit of slack mentality, prone to enter the state of unthinking, greedy for enjoyment, and prone to fall into the quagmire of forgetting the original intention, lost direction. ""The Party's self-revolution is always on the road"" is a major assertion, reminding the Party that it must not lose the spirit of struggle in the midst of applause and praise, and that it must take the revolutionary spirit of ""a thousand blows are still strong"" and the revolutionary spirit of ""not breaking the building of the Lan We must unswervingly push forward the Party's self-revolution with the revolutionary spirit of ""ten thousand blows are still strong"" and the revolutionary will of ""not to break the building of orchids"". The Party's will to lead the social revolution through self-revolution is indestructible. Promoting the great social revolution is the historical mission of our Party; promoting the great self-revolution is the inevitable requirement for accomplishing the historical mission. To promote the self-revolution, it is necessary to connect with the general trend of the social revolution, and to carry out self-reflection and self-awareness in accordance with the inevitable requirements of the social revolution on the basis of an in-depth grasp of the laws of history and the general trend of society. In the new era, the Party is leading the people to carry out a great social revolution, which is unprecedented in terms of the breadth of the areas covered, the profoundness of the adjustment of the pattern of interests touched upon, the acuteness of the contradictions and problems involved, the arduousness of the breakthrough of the obstacles of the system and mechanism, and the complexity of the situation of carrying out a great struggle. This puts high demands on our Party's strong will and ability to manage the social revolution led by the self-revolution. The major assertion that ""the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"" is precisely a forward-looking move that actively adapts to this strategic requirement, requiring the Party to strengthen the urgency and durability of the self-revolution, face up to the profoundly changing Party, national and world conditions, and take the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit"" and the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit"" and the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit With the heroic spirit of ""for the sake of sacrifice"" and the spirit of struggle of ""the one who meets on the narrow road is brave enough to win"", the Party will become stronger and more vigorous in the revolutionary forging, and will provide a strong guarantee for winning a new victory in the great social revolution. The Party's determination to carry out the most thorough self-revolution against corruption to the end is rock-solid. The report of the 20th Party Congress states, ""The fight against corruption is the most thorough self-revolution."" The fight against corruption is related to the greatest politics of the people's heart, and is a major political struggle that we cannot afford to lose and cannot afford to lose, and this struggle is extremely complicated and difficult, and there is no room for the slightest concession or compromise. As long as there are corruption problems arising from the soil and conditions, the fight against corruption can not stop for a moment, must always blow the charge. The major assertion that ""the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"" means that the Party attaches great importance to the persistence and harmfulness of corruption, and will always maintain zero tolerance for corruption on the new journey, with zero tolerance and zero tolerance, more vigorously curbing incremental increase and clearing stock, and integrating the strong deterrent effect of not daring to rot, the rigid institutional constraints of not being able to rot and the ideological and educational advantages of not wanting to rot, into a continuous process. We will integrate the powerful deterrent effect of not daring to corrupt, the rigid institutional constraints of not being able to corrupt, and the ideological and educational advantages of not wanting to corrupt, continuously remove all factors that undermine the Party's advancement and purity, and continuously remove all the viruses that erode the Party's healthy body, resolutely win the protracted battle against corruption, and maintain the Party's strong vitality and powerful combat effectiveness forever. On the new journey, we must always maintain the Party's self-revolution is always on the road of firm persistence, in-depth implementation of the general requirements of the Party's construction in the new era, comprehensively promote the Party's self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, self-improvement, and unremittingly to the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party to the depth of the advancement. Enhance the deep underpinnings of self-revolution. The fundamental reason why the CPC is able to unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution is that our Party does not have any special interests of its own, except for the interests of the country, the nation and the people. ""Without self-interest, the world is self-evident."" Because of selflessness, our Party can get rid of all interest groups, power groups, privileged class of roundup corrosion, relying on self-revolution to jump out of the historical cycle rate of the rise and fall of governance. On the new journey, continue to push the party's self-revolution to a deeper level, inevitably require the party to always bear in mind what the CPC is, what to do the fundamental question, always maintain flesh and blood contact with the people, do the most people's fundamental interests of the representatives, defenders and realizers, to consistently promote the party's self-revolution to provide a powerful source of strength. Improve the institutional norms of self-revolution. The system is fundamental, global, stable and long-term. To unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution, it is necessary to have not only the endogenous power of self-restraint, but also the external pressure of institutional constraints. The report of the 20th Party Congress puts forward the idea of ""perfecting the Party's self-revolutionary institutional normative system"", which is a strategic plan for realizing the idea of ""comprehensively governing the Party from a strict standpoint is always on the way, and the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"", and provides a fundamental guideline for the Party to open up new horizons of self-revolution under the conditions of long-term governance. This strategic plan provides a fundamental guideline for the Party to continuously open up new horizons of self-revolution under the conditions of long-term governance. On the new journey, we should give full play to the role of the system in consolidating the fundamentals, promoting the advantages, mending the shortcomings, and benefiting the long-term, focus on the formation of a long-term mechanism for adhering to the truth, correcting errors, identifying problems, and correcting deviations, strengthen the institutional guarantee for the Party's self-revolution, improve the supervision system of the Party and the state, adhere to the system of governance of the Party and govern the Party in accordance with the rules, and ensure that the Party's self-revolution will be promoted in a normalized way and develop in a sustainable manner with a more complete, coordinated, and mature system. Development. Strengthening corrective action and discipline in a strict tone. The issue of style has a bearing on the direction of people's hearts and on the survival of the ruling party. The Party's style is a centralized manifestation of the Party's original mission and nature and purpose, and strict style and discipline is a necessary way to promote self-revolution. Style construction is always on the way, the overall strict governance of the party is always on the way, the party's self-revolution is always on the way. On the new journey to continue to promote self-revolution, we must persistently strengthen the style of construction, adhere to the tone of strict and unshakeable, adhere to the idea of strict, strict supervision, strict discipline, strict governance, strict style and anti-corruption strict organic unity, perseverance and correct the ""four winds"", the new wind, reinforcing the dam of the central eight provisions, opposing privileged thinking and privileged phenomena, the strict requirements of the implementation of the ""Four Winds"", the new wind, strengthening the central eight provisions, opposing privileged thoughts and privileged Phenomenon, the strict requirements are implemented into the whole process of party management, to win the trust and support of the masses with the new effectiveness of style construction, and constantly strengthen the political foundation of the party's long-term rule. (Signed: Ling Shengyin, Han Fei, Chen Maoxia)","The Party's self-revolution is an essential aspect of the Party's understanding of the laws of self-construction and the laws of governing. It is a way to continuously address outstanding problems within the Party itself and lead the people to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Party's will to carry the self-revolution through the whole process of the great cause is tenacious, and it is necessary to maintain the never-relenting state of mind and an unrelenting attitude of struggle. The Party's determination to carry out a self-revolution, along with the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country and the promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, is a crucial factor in ensuring the long-term survival of the Party and the country. The Party's self-revolution must not be slackened, and only by constantly promoting the Party's self-revolution can we ensure that the Party will not deteriorate in quality, color, or taste. The Party's self-revolution is always on the road."

Remembering and practicing the original mission of seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a red thread running through the history of our party's century-long struggle. The roots of the Party lie in the people, its bloodline in the people, and its strength in the people. Looking back on the Party's struggle, no matter how difficult the conditions and how hard the environment, the Chinese Communists have always had the interests of the people in their hearts, and they have always attached importance to close contact with the people.

On March 5, 60 years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong inscribed a call to ""learn from Comrade Lei Feng"". Now, 60 years later, Lei Feng's spirit is ever new, and Lei Feng's image is deeply rooted in people's hearts. As an ordinary soldier, Lei Feng can win the respect of hundreds of millions of people and inspire the growth of generation after generation because Lei Feng's spirit condenses the essence of the excellent traditional virtues of the Chinese nation and the advanced thinking of the Communists, is a vivid embodiment of the core values of socialism, and is the nutritive agent for cultivating new men of the times who will take on the great responsibility of national rejuvenation. Reading Lei Feng's Diary, one can feel that between the lines is full of Lei Feng's simple and sincere love for the Party, the country, the people, and the cause, and this love stems from Lei Feng's heartfelt gratitude. Lei Feng is a lonely and poor children, born in the old society, growing up in the new China, personally experienced from the old society to the new China's sweeping changes, and know the happy taste of being the master of the turn over, and realize that the party has given himself everything. Lei Feng compares the Party to a mother, and his heart is full of endless gratitude to the Party. ""It is important to have a grateful heart, and all people should have a grateful heart."" Gratitude is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, know gratitude to know love, know responsibility, know responsibility, know reverence, will be grateful to a positive mindset for the Party and the people, for the country and the nation to bear responsibility, solid work. In the new era of progress, we should be like Lei Feng, always ask yourself ""If you are a drop of water, do you moisturize an inch of land? If you are a ray of sunshine, do you light up a minute of darkness"", know the grace and responsibility of the cause, for the party and the people to make their due contribution. It is said that faith is a kind of soulful love. In Lei Feng, we can see the distinctive mark of faith and love. Lei Feng because there is a great love for the party and the country and the people, and thus firm faith in communism; and because of the firm faith, and constantly strengthen the heart of the great love. Theoretical armament is the cornerstone of faith. Lei Feng all his life as the party's theory of ""weapons"" ""food"" and ""steering wheel"", through learning, practice and understanding, sublimated into ""listen to the party, Through learning, practicing and understanding, we have sublimated into the firm conviction of ""listening to the Party and following the Party"". Today we learn to carry forward the spirit of Lei Feng, an important aspect is to consciously strengthen theoretical learning, establish a correct world view, outlook on life and values, the lofty beliefs and convictions are deeply rooted in the heart, practiced in the line. There is faith in the heart, there is power at the feet. The majority of officers and soldiers in the new era should also be like Lei Feng firm faith in life, with firm faith beliefs to stimulate the power of progress, casting loyal quality. Why is Lei Feng's face always overflowing with a bright smile from the bottom of his heart? Because he believes that ""serving the people is the greatest happiness"" and ""devoting limited life to unlimited service to the people"" is the greatest value of life. To serve the people wholeheartedly is not only the purpose of our party, but also a concrete goal and important way for communists to realize the value of life. Li Baoguo, the ""New Fool on the Taihang Mountains"", who wrote his thesis on the earth and used his scientific research to help farmers get rid of poverty and become rich, Huang Wenxiu, the first secretary of the village who fixed his young life on the road to help the poor, Huang Wenxiu, the ""Heroic Soldier of Demining"", who cried out in the critical moment, ""Get back, let me do it"", and Li Baoguo, the ""Heroic Soldier of Demining"". Du Fuguo, the ""Heroic Soldier of Mine Clearance"" and other heroic figures have demonstrated the new style of the CPC in serving the people in the new era. Revolutionary soldiers are the people's sons and daughters, and have always adhered to the purpose of serving the people. The history of the People's Army can be said to be a history of revolutionary soldiers who have struggled for the interests of the people with their youth, blood and lives. At present, as expected to achieve the goal of building the army for 100 years, accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army mission on the shoulders of our generation of soldiers, the majority of officers and soldiers in the new journey to take up the sacred mission, both responsibility and honor, everyone should set up a swan, do the struggler, consciously committed to the era of the torrent.

涵养人格魅力是塑造形象成就事业的关键一环 来源：中国军网 作者：傅凌艳 责任编辑：刘上靖 2023-02-16 17:34:00 1,人格魅力，是人的信仰、气质、品德、才智等融汇而成的感召力量。具有真正人格魅力的党员干部，是通过自身良好的综合素质和行为表现，其言有号召力、其行有带动力、其德有感染力，不断提高自己的非权力影响力，用人格力量凝聚人心，鼓舞斗志，团结和带领团队事半功倍地干成事、干好事。 提升能力水平，摒弃虚功清淡。 才情若春水，风日俱洒然。党员干部拥有真理的力量、思想的力量，才会技高一筹，以才服人。党员干部要善于从政治上看问题，站稳立场、把准方向。要善于运用马克思主义立场、观点和方法，透过现象看到本质及其产生的原因，增强认识规律、找准规律、把握规律的能力，提高运用规律的水平，从而在具体工作中增强主动性和有效性。面对新问题、新矛盾、新形势，党员干部要有本领恐慌，增强学习紧迫感。要保持“空杯心态”，坚持向实践学、向群众学、向同事学，不断涵养浩然之气、汲取精神养分。要大兴调研之风，坚持把民情民意民智作为科学决策、完善政策、改进工作、推动发展的“活性炭”，及时深入基层调查研究，把实际情况摸清楚，把工作中的短板弱项搞清楚，在抓落实时找准主攻方向，在高质量跨越式发展中赢得优势、赢得主动、赢得未来。 淬炼政德“内功”，发挥“表率效应”。 人无德不立，官无德不为。政德是社会道德建设的重要风向标，是党员干部必须修炼的“内功”。作为党员干部，面对错综复杂的内外环境和艰巨繁重的发展任务，要始终坚定理想信念，站稳政治立场，把全心全意为人民服务作为一切工作的出发点，做到问计于民、问需于民，为群众办实事、做好事、解难事，努力当好群众的知心人、暖心人、贴心人。要规范自身德行，严格要求和约束自己的行为品德，从自身做起，从小事入手，做老实人、老实做人。凡是要求下属做到的，自己必须首先做到；禁止别人做的，自己坚决不做，用实际行动在人民群众中树立良好形象。 常怀“底线思维”，涵养“归零心态”。 如果说才华和政德是衡量一个人成长进步的标尺，那么心态就是决定这个人提升修为的维度。人生的道路不可能一帆风顺，困难挫折是人生的一门“必修课”。人生不如意事常八九，有道是“最完美的产品在广告里，最完美的爱情在小说里，最完美的婚姻在梦境里”。如果求全责备，倘若心为物役，患得患失，就会悲观绝望，窒息心智，人生道路就会举步维艰。因此，要保持一种不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步的心态，用一分为二的观点看问题，成功时及时总结经验做法，失败后应正确分析原因，寻求解决问题的方法和途径，做到胜不骄、败不馁。党员干部要有“努力向上”的拼劲，也要有“船到桥头自然直”的淡然，不以物喜，不以己悲，以一颗平常心正确看待一切得失。 “做官先做人”。领导的威望并不是建立在下属、群众避而远之和心怀恐惧的基础上，而是建立在真诚信任、尊重信服的基础上。因此，好品德是党员干部干事成事的重要基础，群众认可、同事认可、上级认可，才是党员干部真正的品格和能力的体现。 （作者单位：解放军总医院第七医学中心政治工作部）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230311000602/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201955.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230314193941/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16201955.html,2023-03-11 0:00:00,Cultivating charisma is a key part of shaping the image and accomplishing the career Source: China Military Network Author: Fu Lingyan Editor-in-chief: Liu Shangjing 2023-02-16 17:34:00 1,"Personality charisma, is a person's faith, temperament, character, talent and other fusion of the power of inspiration.

Enhance the level of competence, abandon the virtual work of the light. Talent if spring water, wind and sun are sprinkled. Party members and cadres have the power of truth, the power of thought, will be skillful and talented to convince people. Party members and cadres should be good at looking at the problem from the political point of view, stand firm and accurate direction. To be good at the use of Marxist position, point of view and method, through the phenomenon to see the essence and its causes, to enhance the ability to recognize the law, find the law, grasp the law, improve the level of use of the law, so as to enhance the initiative and effectiveness of the specific work. In the face of new problems, new contradictions, new situations, party members and cadres should have the fear of panic, enhance the sense of urgency to learn. To maintain an ""empty cup mentality"", adhere to the practice of learning, learning from the masses, learning from colleagues, and constantly cultivate the spirit of the gas, draw spiritual sustenance. To flourish the wind of research, adhere to the public opinion and public wisdom as scientific decision-making, improve policy, improve work, promote development of the ""active carbon"", timely and in-depth grass-roots research, the actual situation to feel clear, the work of the short board weaknesses to figure out the implementation of the main direction of attack, to win the advantage in the high-quality leapfrog development, Win the initiative, win the future.

Political ethics is an important wind vane of social moral construction, party members and cadres must cultivate the ""inner strength"". As party members and cadres, in the face of the intricate internal and external environment and the arduous task of development, we must always be firm in our ideals and beliefs, stand firm in our political stance, serve the people wholeheartedly as the starting point for all work, to do the people, ask the people, ask for the people, for the masses to do practical work, do good work, solve difficult problems, and strive to be a good people's knowledgable, warm-hearted and caring people. To regulate their own moral behavior, strict requirements and constraints on their own behavior and moral character, starting from themselves, from small things, do honest people, honest people. Where subordinates are required to do, they must first do; prohibit others to do, they are determined not to do, with practical action in the people to establish a good image. Often ""bottom line thinking"", cultivate ""zero mentality"". If talent and political ethics is a measure of a person's growth and progress of the yardstick, then the mindset is to determine the person to enhance the dimension of cultivation. The road of life can not be smooth sailing, difficulties and setbacks is a life of ""required courses"". Life is not always as good as nine or nine times, there is a saying that ""the most perfect product is in the advertisement, the most perfect love is in the novel, the most perfect marriage is in the dream"". If you are so desperate, if your mind is obsessed with things, you will be pessimistic and despairing, suffocating your mind, and the road of life will be difficult to follow. Therefore, to maintain a no matter what the wind and waves, like an idle mind, with a two-sided view of the problem, the success of the timely summary of the experience and practice, failure should be correctly analyze the reasons for seeking solutions to the problem of the methods and ways to do not be proud of the victory, not discouraged by the defeat. Party members and cadres should have a ""hard up"" of the struggle, but also to have a ""boat to the bridge naturally straight"" of the calm, not to things, not to their own sadness, with a normal heart to correctly look at all the gains and losses. ""Being an official first"". The prestige of leadership is not built on the basis of subordinates, the masses avoid and fear, but on the basis of sincere trust, respect and conviction. Therefore, good character is an important foundation for party cadres to succeed, recognized by the masses, colleagues, superiors, is the real character of party cadres and the embodiment of the ability. (Author's unit: Political Work Department of the Seventh Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital)","Cultivating personality charisma is important for achieving career success and influencing others. Party members and cadres should enhance their competence, maintain a ""empty cup mentality"" to learn from others, and use Marxist perspectives and methods to analyze problems. They should also maintain political ethics and ethical standards, and have a ""hard up"" yet calm mindset. A good reputation is essential for leadership."
党的自我革命永远在路上 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：凌胜银 韩 飞 陈茂霞 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-01 06:36:03 1,党的自我革命永远在路上 ■陆军党的创新理论研究中心 党的二十大报告指出：“全面从严治党永远在路上，党的自我革命永远在路上，决不能有松劲歇脚、疲劳厌战的情绪，必须持之以恒推进全面从严治党，深入推进新时代党的建设新的伟大工程，以党的自我革命引领社会革命。”这一重要论述，彰显了我们党一以贯之坚持自我革命的坚定决心，标志着我们党对自身建设规律和执政规律的认识达到了新高度。新征程上，我们要以自我革命的政治勇气，着力解决我们党自身存在的突出问题，更好带领人民实现中华民族伟大复兴的梦想。 一 马克思主义政党夺取政权不容易，巩固政权更不容易；只要马克思主义执政党不出问题，社会主义国家就出不了大问题，我们就能够跳出“其兴也勃焉，其亡也忽焉”的历史周期率。面对错综复杂的国际形势、艰巨繁重的国内改革发展稳定任务，我们党要做到自身不出问题，就必须勇于进行自我革命。 党的百年历史经验的深刻昭示。党的十九届六中全会强调，“自我革命精神是党永葆青春活力的强大支撑”。这是对党百年奋斗历史经验的科学总结，深刻揭示了党历经千锤百炼更加朝气蓬勃的奥秘所在。百年风雨征程，我们党能够从仅有50多名党员发展成为拥有9600多万名党员、领导着14亿多人口大国、具有重大全球影响力的世界第一大执政党，在一次次血雨腥风中绝境重生，在一次次山重水复中迎来柳暗花明，很重要的原因是永不停歇地进行激浊扬清的自我革命。从一定意义上讲，一部百年党史就是一部不断自我革命的历史。这昭示我们，党的自我革命须臾不容懈怠，只有一刻不停地推进党的自我革命，才能确保党永远不变质、不变色、不变味。 永葆马克思主义政党本色的内在要求。马克思主义政党是无产阶级的先锋队，先进性和纯洁性是无产阶级政党的本质属性。如何永葆先进性和纯洁性，这是我们党作为大党强党必须回答好、解决好的一个根本性问题。实践一再告诫我们，马克思主义政党的先进性和纯洁性不是一成不变的，过去先进纯洁并不等于现在先进纯洁，现在先进纯洁并不等于永远先进纯洁，必须在不断自我革命中锻造而成。推进党的自我革命，决不是一时的要求，决不能有松劲歇脚、疲劳厌战的情绪，决不能有初见成效就万事大吉的念头，必须以彻底的革命精神和坚决的革命勇气，持之以恒滤杂质，锲而不舍清毒素，毫不懈怠袪痼疾，久久为功才能见成效。 新的赶考路上交出优异答卷的必然选择。当前，党带领人民踏上了实现第二个百年奋斗目标新的赶考之路。这条路，既是一条复兴图强的逐梦圆梦之路，也是一条“雄关漫道真如铁”的砥砺前行之路，更是一条“踏平坎坷成大道”的披荆斩棘之路。新征程上，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开，面对来自外部随时可能升级的打压遏制，面对风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验，全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，关键在党。只有始终保持永不懈怠的精神状态和一往无前的奋斗姿态，毫不动摇把党建设得更加坚强有力，才能化风高浪急为风平浪静，变惊涛骇浪为乘风破浪，推动中华民族伟大复兴号巨轮乘风破浪、扬帆远航，向历史和人民交出优异答卷。 二 勇于自我革命，是我们党最鲜明的品格，也是我们党最大的优势。我们党作为世界上最大的马克思主义执政党，要始终赢得人民拥护、巩固长期执政地位，必须时刻保持解决大党独有难题的清醒和坚定。 把党的自我革命贯穿伟大事业全程的决心坚韧不拔。习主席指出：“世界上最可怕的敌人从来是自己。我们党取得了举世瞩目的成就，现在更需要‘愈大愈惧，愈强愈恐’的态度。”越是长期执政，越不能丢掉马克思主义政党的本色，越不能忘记党的初心使命，越不能丧失自我革命精神。当前，全面建设社会主义现代化国家开局起步，中国发展的政治优势、制度优势日益凸显，党员干部中容易出现承平日久、精神懈怠的心态，容易进入不思进取、贪图享乐的状态，容易陷入忘记初心、迷失方向的泥潭。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，警醒全党千万不能在一片喝彩声、赞扬声中失去了斗争精神，必须以“千磨万击还坚劲”的革命精神和“不破楼兰终不还”的革命斗志，把党的自我革命坚定不移推进下去。 以党的自我革命引领社会革命的意志坚不可摧。推进伟大社会革命，是我们党的历史使命所在；推进伟大自我革命，是完成历史使命的必然要求。推进自我革命，必须同社会革命的大趋势贯通起来，在深入把握历史规律和社会大势基础上，按照社会革命的必然要求自省自觉进行。新时代，我们党领导人民进行伟大社会革命，涵盖领域的广泛性、触及利益格局调整的深刻性、涉及矛盾和问题的尖锐性、突破体制机制障碍的艰巨性、进行伟大斗争形势的复杂性，都是前所未有的。这对我们党以自我革命引领社会革命的坚强意志和驾驭能力提出很高要求。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，正是主动适应这一战略要求的前瞻之举，要求党必须强化自我革命的迫切性持久性，直面正在发生深刻变化的党情、国情、世情，以“为有牺牲多壮志”的英雄气概和“狭路相逢勇者胜”的斗争精神，使党在革命性锻造中更加坚强、更有活力，为夺取伟大社会革命新胜利提供坚强保证。 将反腐败这个最彻底的自我革命进行到底的定力坚如磐石。党的二十大报告指出：“反腐败是最彻底的自我革命。”反腐败斗争关系民心这个最大的政治，是一场输不起也不能输的重大政治斗争，这场斗争极其复杂、极其艰难，容不得丝毫退让妥协。只要存在腐败问题产生的土壤和条件，反腐败斗争就一刻不能停，必须永远吹响冲锋号。“党的自我革命永远在路上”的重大论断，意味着我们党高度重视腐败的顽固性和危害性，新征程上对腐败会始终保持零容忍的力度、零容忍的定力，更加有力遏增量、清存量，把不敢腐的强大震慑效能、不能腐的刚性制度约束、不想腐的思想教育优势融于一体，不断清除一切损害党的先进性和纯洁性的因素，不断清除一切侵蚀党的健康肌体的病毒，坚决打赢反腐败斗争攻坚战持久战，永葆党的旺盛生命力和强大战斗力。 三 新征程上，我们必须始终保持党的自我革命永远在路上的坚定执着，深入贯彻新时代党的建设总要求，全面推进党的自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高，坚持不懈把全面从严治党向纵深推进。 增强自我革命的深厚底气。中国共产党之所以能够矢志不渝推进党的自我革命，根本原因在于我们党除了国家、民族、人民的利益，没有任何自己的特殊利益。“不私，而天下自公。”因为无私无畏，所以我们党才能摆脱一切利益集团、权势团体、特权阶层的围猎腐蚀，依靠自我革命跳出治乱兴衰的历史周期率。新征程上，继续把党的自我革命推向深入，必然要求全党始终牢记中国共产党是什么、要干什么这个根本问题，始终保持同人民群众的血肉联系，做最广大人民群众根本利益的代表者、捍卫者和实现者，为一以贯之推进党的自我革命提供强大力量源泉。 完善自我革命的制度规范。制度带有根本性、全局性、稳定性、长期性。坚定不移推进党的自我革命，既要有自我约束的内生动力，更要有制度约束的外部压力。党的二十大报告提出“完善党的自我革命制度规范体系”，这是着眼实现“全面从严治党永远在路上、党的自我革命永远在路上”作出的战略部署，为党在长期执政条件下不断开辟自我革命新境界提供了根本遵循。新征程上，我们要发挥好制度固根本、扬优势、补短板、利长远的作用，聚焦形成坚持真理、修正错误，发现问题、纠正偏差的长效机制，强化党的自我革命制度保障，健全党和国家监督体系，坚持制度治党、依规治党，以更加完备、协调、成熟的制度，确保党的自我革命常态化推进、可持续发展。 以严的基调强化正风肃纪。作风问题关系人心向背，关系执政党的生死存亡。党的作风是党的初心使命、性质宗旨的集中体现，严明作风纪律是推进自我革命的必由之路。作风建设永远在路上，全面从严治党永远在路上，党的自我革命永远在路上。新征程上持续推进自我革命，必须持之以恒加强作风建设，坚持严的基调不动摇，坚持思想从严、监督从严、执纪从严、治吏从严、作风从严和反腐从严有机统一，锲而不舍纠“四风”、扬新风，加固中央八项规定堤坝，反对特权思想和特权现象，把严的要求贯彻到管党治党全过程，以作风建设新成效赢得群众的信赖和支持，不断夯实党长期执政的政治根基。 （执笔：凌胜银、韩 飞、陈茂霞）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230314000345/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16204923.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230315035840/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16204923.html,2023-03-14 0:00:00,The Party's self-revolution is always on the road Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Ling Shengyin Han Fei Chen Maoxia Responsibility: Huang Min 2023-03-01 06:36:03 1,"The Party's self-revolution is always on the road ■ Army Party Innovation Theory Research Center The report of the Party's 20th National Congress points out, ""Comprehensively governing the Party strictly is always on the road, and the Party's self-revolution is always on the road, and there must not be any emotions of relaxation and rest, fatigue and boredom, and we must consistently push forward the comprehensively strict governance of the Party, and deeply push forward the Party's construction of the new era of the new great project, and lead the Party's self-revolution to a social revolution."" This important statement highlights the Party's firm determination to consistently adhere to the self-revolution, marking a new height in our Party's understanding of the laws of self-construction and the laws of governing. On the new journey, we should take the political courage of self-revolution, focus on solving the outstanding problems of the Party itself, and better lead the people to realize the dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is not easy for a Marxist party to seize power, and it is even more difficult to consolidate power; as long as the Marxist ruling party does not have any problems, the socialist country will not have any big problems, and we will be able to jump out of the historical cycle rate of ""its rise is also booming, and its demise is also sudden"". In the face of the intricate international situation and the arduous task of domestic reform, development and stabilization, the Party must have the courage to carry out a self-revolution if it wants to keep itself out of trouble. This is a profound indication of the Party's century-long historical experience. The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee emphasized that ""the spirit of self-revolution is a powerful support for the Party's eternal youthfulness and vitality."" This is a scientific summary of the historical experience of the Party's century-long struggle, which profoundly reveals the mystery of the Party's more vigorous vitality after thousands of years of refinement. A hundred years of wind and rain, our party can be developed from only 50 members to more than 96 million members, leading a large country with a population of more than 1.4 billion people, the world's first major ruling party with significant global influence, in the midst of bloody storms once reborn, in the midst of the mountains and waters ushered in the darkness of the day, a very important reason is to never stop to carry out the turbid and clear the self-revolution. In a certain sense, a hundred years of party history is a history of continuous self-revolution. This shows us that the party's self-revolution must not slacken off, and only by constantly promoting the party's self-revolution can we ensure that the party will never deteriorate in quality, color or taste. The inherent requirements of a Marxist political party. Marxist political party is the vanguard of the proletariat, and advancement and purity are the essential attributes of a proletarian political party. How to keep advanced and pure forever is a fundamental question that our party, as a big and strong party, must answer and solve. Practice has repeatedly warned us that the advancement and purity of Marxist political parties are not static; advanced and pure in the past does not equal advanced and pure now, and advanced and pure now does not equal advanced and pure forever, but must be forged in a continuous self-revolution. Promote the party's self-revolution, never a momentary requirement, there must be no relaxation, fatigue, fatigue, never have the first results on the idea of everything is fine, must be thoroughly revolutionary spirit and resolute revolutionary courage, perseverance and filter impurities, perseverance and clear toxins, do not slacken off to dispel chronic illnesses, and long-term efforts to see the results. The inevitable choice to deliver an excellent answer sheet on the new road to catch up. At present, the party led the people to embark on a new road to realize the second hundred years of struggle. This road is not only a road to revitalize and strengthen the dream, but also a road of ""the road is really like iron"", and a road of ""smooth out the bumps into the road"", the road of the thorns. On the new journey, the change of the world, the change of the times, the change of history is unfolding in an unprecedented way, in the face of the suppression and containment from the outside may escalate at any time, in the face of high winds and waves or even shocking waves of the major test, the construction of a comprehensive socialist modernization of the country, and comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the key in the party. Only by maintaining a never-relenting state of mind and an unrelenting attitude of struggle, and by unswervingly building the Party into a stronger and more powerful one, can we turn the high winds and waves into calm, and the frightening waves into a stormy sea, and promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to ride the stormy waves and sail away, and hand over an excellent answer to history and the people. Second, the courage to self-revolution is the most distinctive character of our Party and its greatest advantage. As the world's largest Marxist ruling party, our Party must always maintain the sobriety and firmness to solve the unique problems of large parties in order to win the support of the people and consolidate its long-term ruling position. The determination to carry the Party's self-revolution through the whole process of its great cause is tenacious. President Xi pointed out: ""The most formidable enemy in the world is never oneself. Our Party has made world-renowned achievements, but now it needs the attitude of 'the greater the fear, the stronger the fear' even more."" The longer it stays in power, the less it can lose its Marxist party character, the less it can forget the Party's original mission, and the less it can lose the spirit of self-revolution. At present, the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country started, China's development of the political advantages, institutional advantages are increasingly prominent, party members and cadres are prone to the emergence of Chengping day long, the spirit of slack mentality, prone to enter the state of unthinking, greedy for enjoyment, and prone to fall into the quagmire of forgetting the original intention, lost direction. ""The Party's self-revolution is always on the road"" is a major assertion, reminding the Party that it must not lose the spirit of struggle in the midst of applause and praise, and that it must take the revolutionary spirit of ""a thousand blows are still strong"" and the revolutionary spirit of ""not breaking the building of the Lan We must unswervingly push forward the Party's self-revolution with the revolutionary spirit of ""ten thousand blows are still strong"" and the revolutionary will of ""not to break the building of orchids"". The Party's will to lead the social revolution through self-revolution is indestructible. Promoting the great social revolution is the historical mission of our Party; promoting the great self-revolution is the inevitable requirement for accomplishing the historical mission. To promote the self-revolution, it is necessary to connect with the general trend of the social revolution, and to carry out self-reflection and self-awareness in accordance with the inevitable requirements of the social revolution on the basis of an in-depth grasp of the laws of history and the general trend of society. In the new era, the Party is leading the people to carry out a great social revolution, which is unprecedented in terms of the breadth of the areas covered, the profoundness of the adjustment of the pattern of interests touched upon, the acuteness of the contradictions and problems involved, the arduousness of the breakthrough of the obstacles of the system and mechanism, and the complexity of the situation of carrying out a great struggle. This puts high demands on our Party's strong will and ability to manage the social revolution led by the self-revolution. The major assertion that ""the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"" is precisely a forward-looking move that actively adapts to this strategic requirement, requiring the Party to strengthen the urgency and durability of the self-revolution, face up to the profoundly changing Party, national and world conditions, and take the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit"" and the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit"" and the heroic spirit of ""sacrificing for the sake of the heroic spirit With the heroic spirit of ""for the sake of sacrifice"" and the spirit of struggle of ""the one who meets on the narrow road is brave enough to win"", the Party will become stronger and more vigorous in the revolutionary forging, and will provide a strong guarantee for winning a new victory in the great social revolution. The Party's determination to carry out the most thorough self-revolution against corruption to the end is rock-solid. The report of the 20th Party Congress states, ""The fight against corruption is the most thorough self-revolution."" The fight against corruption is related to the greatest politics of the people's heart, and is a major political struggle that we cannot afford to lose and cannot afford to lose, and this struggle is extremely complicated and difficult, and there is no room for the slightest concession or compromise. As long as there are corruption problems arising from the soil and conditions, the fight against corruption can not stop for a moment, must always blow the charge. The major assertion that ""the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"" means that the Party attaches great importance to the persistence and harmfulness of corruption, and will always maintain zero tolerance for corruption on the new journey, with zero tolerance and zero tolerance, more vigorously curbing incremental increase and clearing stock, and integrating the strong deterrent effect of not daring to rot, the rigid institutional constraints of not being able to rot and the ideological and educational advantages of not wanting to rot, into a continuous process. We will integrate the powerful deterrent effect of not daring to corrupt, the rigid institutional constraints of not being able to corrupt, and the ideological and educational advantages of not wanting to corrupt, continuously remove all factors that undermine the Party's advancement and purity, and continuously remove all the viruses that erode the Party's healthy body, resolutely win the protracted battle against corruption, and maintain the Party's strong vitality and powerful combat effectiveness forever. On the new journey, we must always maintain the Party's self-revolution is always on the road of firm persistence, in-depth implementation of the general requirements of the Party's construction in the new era, comprehensively promote the Party's self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, self-improvement, and unremittingly to the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party to the depth of the advancement. Enhance the deep underpinnings of self-revolution. The fundamental reason why the CPC is able to unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution is that our Party does not have any special interests of its own, except for the interests of the country, the nation and the people. ""Without self-interest, the world is self-evident."" Because of selflessness, our Party can get rid of all interest groups, power groups, privileged class of roundup corrosion, relying on self-revolution to jump out of the historical cycle rate of the rise and fall of governance. On the new journey, continue to push the party's self-revolution to a deeper level, inevitably require the party to always bear in mind what the CPC is, what to do the fundamental question, always maintain flesh and blood contact with the people, do the most people's fundamental interests of the representatives, defenders and realizers, to consistently promote the party's self-revolution to provide a powerful source of strength. Improve the institutional norms of self-revolution. The system is fundamental, global, stable and long-term. To unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution, it is necessary to have not only the endogenous power of self-restraint, but also the external pressure of institutional constraints. The report of the 20th Party Congress puts forward the idea of ""perfecting the Party's self-revolutionary institutional normative system"", which is a strategic plan for realizing the idea of ""comprehensively governing the Party from a strict standpoint is always on the way, and the Party's self-revolution is always on the way"", and provides a fundamental guideline for the Party to open up new horizons of self-revolution under the conditions of long-term governance. This strategic plan provides a fundamental guideline for the Party to continuously open up new horizons of self-revolution under the conditions of long-term governance. On the new journey, we should give full play to the role of the system in consolidating the fundamentals, promoting the advantages, mending the shortcomings, and benefiting the long-term, focus on the formation of a long-term mechanism for adhering to the truth, correcting errors, identifying problems, and correcting deviations, strengthen the institutional guarantee for the Party's self-revolution, improve the supervision system of the Party and the state, adhere to the system of governance of the Party and govern the Party in accordance with the rules, and ensure that the Party's self-revolution will be promoted in a normalized way and develop in a sustainable manner with a more complete, coordinated, and mature system. Development. Strengthening corrective action and discipline in a strict tone. The issue of style has a bearing on the direction of people's hearts and on the survival of the ruling party.

思想战线丨像焦裕禄那样解决问题 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：吉象 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-17 07:03:09 0,像焦裕禄那样解决问题 ■吉象 重读焦裕禄的事迹，发现他有着十分强烈的问题意识。早在河南杞县工作时，他在一份工作报告中就提出“有的村子干部不团结，干群关系不够密切”等问题。调任兰考县工作后，他在一次座谈会上着重讲了干部领导方法和工作作风上存在的问题，归纳起来有“十多十少”“五个跟不上”等等。正是因为焦裕禄在工作中牢固树立问题意识、始终坚持问题导向，在深入调研中发现问题、在独立思考中分析问题、在真抓实干中解决问题，才能针对兰考县发展过程中面临的问题开出良方，使得兰考县的面貌发生了深刻变化，同时也为我们留下了宝贵的精神财富。 “问题就是事物的矛盾。哪里有没有解决的矛盾，哪里就有问题。”问题无时不在、无处不在。能不能发现问题、敢不敢正视问题、会不会解决问题，不仅是认识能力和工作水平问题，也是工作作风和精神状态问题。一个有作为的党员干部，应该树立强烈的问题意识，在发现和分析问题中积累经验、增长才干，在解决问题中彰显作为、创造佳绩。 在深入调研中发现问题。调查研究是我们党的传家宝，也是我们做好各项工作的基本功。毛泽东同志曾指出，“你对于某个问题没有调查，就停止你对于某个问题的发言权”“调查就像‘十月怀胎’，解决问题就像‘一朝分娩’。调查就是解决问题”。为了治理“三害”，焦裕禄先后抽调120名干部、技术员等组成调查队，跋涉数千公里，拿到了第一手资料。正是在深入调查研究中，他基本掌握了内涝、风沙、盐碱的规律，探索出“贴膏药”“扎针”等土办法，以苦干实干把沙丘变成了沃野。广大党员干部要向焦裕禄学习，走出“高墙深院”，走到田间地头，用更多的时间蹲在基层、深入一线，用更多的精力“解剖麻雀”、了解实情，这样才能及时准确发现问题。 在独立思考中分析问题。深入实际、了解实际，落脚点在于科学分析问题。除了走到、看到、听到，还要想到、分析到，通过深入细致地分析思考，把握事物的本质和规律，找到解决问题之道。焦裕禄在调查研究中，对如何改变兰考县面貌进行了深入思考和分析，既看到影响兰考发展的自然因素，如内涝、风沙、盐碱等，又看到影响兰考发展的社会因素，包括领导思想状况、干部精神状态等，进而为改变兰考面貌开出良方——“一个落后地区的改变，首先是领导思想的改变。领导思想不改变，外地的经验学不进，本地的经验总结不起来”。现实中一些党员干部做不好调查研究工作，既有不愿吃苦、怕麻烦的懒惰思想作怪，也有个人研究问题能力弱的因素使然。党员干部要提高对问题的认识能力、分析能力、思考能力，通过实践锻炼切实掌握去粗取精、去伪存真的本领，练就“拨云见日、洞悉本质”的功夫，以精准分析问题确保真正解决问题。 在真抓实干中解决问题。在调查研究中发现问题，在独立思考中分析问题，最终要落实到有效解决问题上。焦裕禄搞调查研究，走一路，看一路，不仅有思考、有想法，而且有部署、有行动，知行合一，说干就干，以“对群众的那股亲劲、抓工作的那股韧劲、干事业的那股拼劲”改变了兰考面貌，铸就了不朽的丰碑。要想解决问题，关键在于真抓实干。解决问题，有的要大火快炒，有的要小火慢炖，但都需要向问题开刀、向顽疾亮剑的决心勇气。在薄弱环节、关键问题上较真，让想遮的遮不住，想躲的躲不掉，这样才能打开天窗、一治到底，在解决问题中真出业绩、出真业绩，以实干担当履职尽责，以工作实绩取信于民。 能否及时发现问题、深入分析问题、有效解决问题，检验的是政治素质、党性原则和能力水平。党员干部只有具备较高的政治素质，才能“不畏浮云遮望眼”，在错综复杂的形势中看清事物的本质，抓住事物的要害；只有具备较强的党性原则，才能既“身入”更“心至”，坚持实事求是、一切从实际出发，敢说真话、敢报实情；只有具备较高的能力水平，才能有想法、有办法，遇事敢拍板，遇难敢攻关，以担当实干交出“为官一任、造福一方”的合格答卷。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230320000037/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16210089.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230321130445/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16210089.html,2023-03-20 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨Solving Problems Like Jiao Yulu Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Jixiang Editor-in-Chief：Huang Min 2023-03-17 07:03:09 0,"Problem solving like Jiao Yulu ■ Jixiang reread the deeds of Jiao Yulu, found that he has a very strong sense of the problem. As early as when working in Qixian County, Henan Province, he put forward in a work report, ""some village cadres are not united, the relationship between cadres and the masses is not close enough"" and other issues. After transferring to work in Lankao County, he focused on cadres at a symposium on leadership methods and work style problems, summarized in ""ten more than ten less"" ""five can not keep up with"" and so on. It is because Jiao Yulu firmly established in the work of problem awareness, always adhere to the problem-oriented, in-depth research to find problems, independent thinking in the analysis of the problem, in the real work to solve the problem, in order to Lankawe County, the development of the problems faced in the process of prescribing a prescription for Lankawe County, the face of Lankawe County has undergone a profound change, but also left us a valuable spiritual wealth. ""The problem is the contradiction of things. Where there is no contradiction to be solved, there is a problem."" Problems are always and everywhere. Whether you can find problems, dare to face problems, will solve problems is not only the ability to understand and work level problems, but also work style and mental state problems. A party member and cadres, should establish a strong sense of problem, in the discovery and analysis of problems in the accumulation of experience, growth of competence, in the solution of the problem as a manifestation of the creation of good results. In-depth research to find problems. Investigation and research is our party's heirloom, but also our basic skills to do a good job. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that ""you have not investigated a certain issue, you stop your right to speak on a certain issue,"" ""investigation is like 'October pregnancy', problem solving is like 'one day of labor'. Delivery'. Investigating is solving problems"". In order to control the ""three evils"", Jiao Yulu has deployed 120 cadres, technicians and other survey team, traveled thousands of kilometers, to get first-hand information. It is in-depth investigation and research, he basically mastered the waterlogging, sand, salt and alkali laws, explored the ""plastering"", ""pinning"" and other local methods, to hard work and practical work to turn the sand dunes into a fertile field. Party members and cadres should learn from Jiao Yulu, out of the ""high walls and deep yard"", go to the field, with more time to squat at the grassroots level, in-depth, with more energy to ""anatomize the sparrow"", to understand the real situation, so that we can timely and accurately find the problem. Analyze the problem in independent thinking. In-depth practical, understanding of the actual situation, the end point is to scientifically analyze the problem. In addition to walk, see, hear, but also think, analyze to, through in-depth analysis of thinking, to grasp the essence of things and laws, to find a solution to the problem. Jiao Yulu in the investigation and research, how to change the face of Lankao County in-depth thinking and analysis, both to see the natural factors affecting the development of Lankao, such as waterlogging, sand, salinity, etc., but also to see the impact of the development of the social factors of Lankao, including the leadership ideological situation, cadres, such as the state of mind, and then for the change of the face of the Lankawe opened a prescription---. ""The change of a backward area, first of all, the change of leadership thinking. Leadership thinking does not change, foreign experience can not learn, local experience can not be summarized. The reality is that some party members and cadres do not do a good job of investigation and research, both unwilling to suffer, afraid of trouble lazy thinking strange, but also the weak ability to study the problem of personal factors. Party members and cadres to improve the ability to recognize the problem, the ability to analyze, the ability to think, through practical exercises to effectively master the rough to extract the essence, to remove the false and save the real skills, to practice the ""clouds to see the sun, insight into the essence of the"" kung fu, to accurately analyze the problem to ensure that the real problem solving. Problem solving in the real work. In the investigation and research to find problems, in independent thinking to analyze the problem, and ultimately to be implemented to effectively solve the problem. Jiao Yulu to engage in research, go all the way, see all the way, not only thinking, ideas, and deployment, action, knowledge and action, said dry, to ""the masses of that pro-strength, grasp the work of that tenacity, do the cause of that force"" to change the face of Lankawe, casting a monumental monument. To solve the problem, the key lies in the real work. To solve the problem, some of them have to be fired quickly, some of them have to be stewed slowly over a small fire, but they all need to open the knife to the problem, to the persistent problems of determination and courage. In the weak links, key issues on the real, so that you want to cover up can not cover up, want to hide hide, so that we can open the windows of heaven, a rule in the end, in solving the problem really out of the performance, out of the real performance, in order to bear the responsibility for the work, in order to work to win the trust of the people. The ability to find problems in a timely manner, in-depth analysis of the problem, effectively solve the problem, the test is the political quality, party principles and level of competence. Party members and cadres only have a high political quality, in order to ""not afraid of the floating clouds overlooking the eyes"", in the intricate situation to see the essence of things, to grasp the crux of the matter; only with a strong party principle, in order to not only ""body into"" more ""heart to"", adhere to seek truth from facts, all from the practical point of view, dare to speak the truth, dare to report the truth; only with a high level of competence, in order to have the idea, have a way, in the event of a dare to clap the board, dare to attack, to take on the responsibility of the practical work to hand over the ""for the official, to benefit a party"" qualified answer sheet.

始终把党的政治建设摆在首位 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：任明哲 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-22 08:26:43 0,始终把党的政治建设摆在首位 ■任明哲 党的政治建设是党的根本性建设，决定党的建设方向和效果。党的二十届二中全会对深入推进全面从严治党提出明确要求，强调要健全全面从严治党体系，以党的政治建设为统领，扎实推进党的各方面建设，推动新时代党的建设新的伟大工程向纵深发展。新时代新征程，我们必须不断推进党的政治建设，坚定政治立场，把准政治方向，坚守政治原则，提高政治能力，为全面建设社会主义现代化国家提供坚强保障。 政党是特殊的政治组织，政治属性是政党的根本属性。我们党作为马克思主义政党，自成立之日起就在指导思想、奋斗目标等方面旗帜鲜明地宣示自己的政治属性和政治使命。“旗帜鲜明讲政治、保证党的团结和集中统一是党的生命，也是我们党能成为百年大党、创造世纪伟业的关键所在。”党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚持以党的政治建设为统领，全面加强党的领导，把坚持党中央集中统一领导作为最高政治原则，确保党发挥总揽全局、协调各方的领导核心作用，使今天我们这个拥有9600多万名党员的马克思主义政党更加团结统一。党的十九大强调，保证全党服从中央，坚持党中央权威和集中统一领导，是党的政治建设的首要任务。前进道路上，我们必须始终把党的政治建设摆在首位，教育引导全体党员深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，确保全党在政治立场、政治方向、政治原则、政治道路上同以习近平同志为核心的党中央保持高度一致，确保党的团结统一。 在党的建设总体布局中，政治建设是“灵魂”和“根基”，是管总、管根本的，对党的其他建设具有统领提携、纲举目张的作用。党的政治建设抓好了，政治方向、政治立场、政治原则、政治大局把握住了，党的建设就立了标、铸了魂。如果党的政治建设不力，党的其他建设就会失去根基，把党建设得更加坚强有力就会成为一句空话。新时代推进党的政治建设是一个长期工程，不应有“毕其功于一役”的想法或“一阵风”式的思维倾向，必须以持之以恒、驰而不息的决心和毅力，以“永远在路上”的自觉推进党的政治建设。要以党章为根本遵循，把党章明确的党的性质和宗旨、指导思想和奋斗目标、路线和纲领落到实处；突显党的政治建设的根本性地位，聚焦党的政治属性、政治使命、政治目标、政治追求持续发力；把政治标准和政治要求贯穿党的思想建设、组织建设、作风建设、纪律建设以及制度建设、反腐败斗争始终，以政治上的加强推动全面从严治党向纵深发展，引领带动党的建设质量全面提高；坚持问题导向，注重“靶向治疗”，针对政治意识不强、政治立场不稳、政治能力不足、政治行为不端等突出问题强弱项、补短板；把党的政治建设融入党和国家重大决策部署的制定和落实全过程，做到党的政治建设与各项工作特别是中心工作紧密结合、相互促进。 习近平总书记指出，在干部干好工作所需的各种能力中，政治能力是第一位的。有了过硬的政治能力，才能做到观察分析形势把握政治因素，筹划推动工作落实政治要求，分析解决问题防范政治风险，才能在错综复杂的形势中“不畏浮云遮望眼”“乱云飞渡仍从容”。然而，党员干部的政治能力不是与生俱来的，既要靠日复一日的学习积累，更要靠一点一滴的政治历练和实践锻炼。政治上的坚定，源于理论上的清醒。党员干部要按照学懂弄通做实的要求，深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，坚持读原著、学原文、悟原理，不断提高马克思主义思想觉悟和理论水平。新形势下，意识形态领域斗争尖锐复杂，社会思想文化多元多样多变，铸魂与蛀魂、固根与毁根的较量一刻也没有停止。面对各种错误思潮，党员干部务必敢于斗争、善于斗争，始终严守党的政治纪律和政治规矩，在拥护什么、反对什么的大是大非面前态度特别鲜明、立场特别坚定、行动特别坚决，在任何时候任何情况下都始终站在党的立场上想问题、办事情。同时，要严肃认真开展党内政治生活，用好批评和自我批评的思想武器，在不断检视、反省自身中，切实提高政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力。 （作者单位：兰州大学马克思主义学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230322234207/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16211067.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230322075516/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16211067.html,2023-03-23 0:00:00,Always put the party's political construction in the first place Source: china military network - liberation army newspaper Author: Ren Mingzhe Editor-in-chief: Huang Min 2023-03-22 08:26:43 0,"Always put the party's political construction in the first place ■ Ren Mingzhe The party's political construction is the fundamental construction of the party, determining the direction and effect of the party's construction. The second plenary session of the twentieth session of the Party put forward clear requirements for the in-depth promotion of the overall strict governance of the Party, emphasizing the need to improve the system of comprehensive strict governance of the Party, with the political construction of the Party as the overall leader, and solidly promote the construction of all aspects of the Party, and promote the new era of the Party's construction of a new great project to the vertical and deep development. In the new era and new journey, we must continuously promote the political construction of the Party, strengthen its political stance, set its political direction, adhere to its political principles, and improve its political capacity, so as to provide a strong guarantee for the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country. Political parties are special political organizations, and political attributes are the fundamental attributes of political parties. As a Marxist political party, our party has, since the day of its founding, flagrantly declared its political attributes and political mission in terms of its guiding ideology and striving goals. ""Speaking clearly about politics and ensuring the unity and centralization of the Party are the life of the Party and the key to our Party's ability to become a century-old party and create a century of greatness."" Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has adhered to the political construction of the Party as the overall leader, strengthened Party leadership in all aspects, made adherence to the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee the supreme political principle, and ensured that the Party plays the role of the leading core with an overarching view of the overall situation and coordination of all parties, making today's Marxist political party with more than 96 million Party members even more united and unified. The 19th CPC National Congress emphasized that ensuring that the entire Party obeys the central government and adheres to the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee is the primary task of the Party's political construction. On the way forward, we must always put the party's political construction in the first place, educate and guide all party members to deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", firmly ""four self-confidence The Party has been educating and guiding all Party members to deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", to enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", firm up the ""four confidence"", and achieve the ""two safeguards"", so as to ensure that the Party maintains a high degree of consistency with the Central Committee of the CPC, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and to ensure Party unity and unity in terms of its political standpoint, political direction, political principles, and political path. In the overall layout of the party's construction, political construction is the ""soul"" and ""foundation"", is the overall management, management of the fundamental, the other construction of the party has the role of leading and carrying, outline. The party's political construction, political direction, political position, political principles, political situation grasp, the party's construction on the standard, cast the soul. If the party's political construction is not strong, the party's other construction will lose its foundation, and build the party stronger will become an empty word. The new era to promote the party's political construction is a long-term project, there should not be a ""success in a battle"" idea or ""a gust of wind"" type of thinking tendency, must be persistent, unrelenting determination and perseverance, with ""always on the road"" consciously promote the party's political construction, the party's political construction is a long-term project. Road"" consciously promote the party's political construction. We should take the Party Constitution as the fundamental guideline, put the Party's nature and purpose, guiding ideology and goal, route and program clearly defined in the Party Constitution into practice; highlight the fundamental status of the Party's political construction, focus on the Party's political attributes, political mission, political goals and political pursuit of sustained efforts; and put the political standards and political requirements throughout the Party's ideological construction, organization construction, style construction, discipline construction, as well as system construction, anti-corruption, and the fight against corruption, in order to politically strengthen the political construction. We will continue to strengthen political standards and requirements throughout the Party's ideological construction, organizational construction, style construction, disciplinary construction, institutional construction, and anti-corruption struggle, and promote the development of the Party's overall strict governance to a deeper and deeper level with political enhancement, leading and driving the overall improvement of the quality of the Party's construction; we will adhere to the problem-oriented approach, focusing on the ""target treatment"", and strengthen the weaknesses and make up for the short boards against the outstanding problems of weak political awareness, unstable political position, insufficient political ability, and improper political behaviors; and integrate the political construction of the Party into the major decisions and deployment of the Party and the country. The Party's political construction has been integrated into the entire process of formulating and implementing major decisions and deployments of the Party and the state, so that the Party's political construction is closely integrated with and promotes each other's work, especially the central work. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that among the various abilities needed for cadres to do a good job, political ability comes first. With excellent political ability, in order to observe and analyze the situation to grasp the political factors, planning to promote the implementation of political requirements, analyzing and solving problems to prevent political risks, in order to in the intricate and complex situation, ""do not fear the floating clouds to cover the eyes"", ""chaotic clouds flying across the river is still calm"". The political ability of party members and cadres is not the same as that of their counterparts. However, the political ability of party members and cadres is not inherent, not only rely on the accumulation of day-to-day learning, but also rely on a little bit of political experience and practical exercise. Political firmness comes from theoretical sobriety. Party members and cadres should, in accordance with the requirements of learning and understanding, study Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in depth, insist on reading the original text, learning the original text, and understanding the principles, and constantly improve the Marxist ideological awareness and theoretical level. Under the new situation, the struggle in the field of ideology is acute and complex, the social ideology and culture is diversified and changeable, and the battle between soul-casting and soul-decaying, root-fixing and root-destroying has not stopped for a moment. In the face of all kinds of erroneous thinking, party members and cadres must dare to fight, good at fighting, always strictly abide by the party's political discipline and political rules, in support of what, against what the big right and wrong in front of the attitude is particularly clear, the position is particularly firm, the action is particularly resolute, at any time in any case are always standing in the position of the party to think, do things. At the same time, we should seriously carry out the internal political life of the Party, use the ideological weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and effectively improve our political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution in constantly examining and reflecting on ourselves. (Author's unit: School of Marxism, Lanzhou University)","The importance of putting the party's political construction first is emphasized in the article. Political construction is the fundamental construction of the party and determines the direction and effectiveness of the party's construction. In the new era and new journey, it is necessary to continuously promote the political construction of the party, strengthen its political stance, set its political direction, adhere to its political principles, and improve its political capacity in order to ensure the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country.

We must always adhere to the political building of the army as the foundation of the army, and build the people's army to be stronger, purer and more reliable. At present, our country is in a critical stage of development from big to strong, and our army is striding forward on the journey to build a world-class army. The political construction of the army is related to the overall situation of the Party and the army, the future of the people's army, and the success or failure of the cause of strengthening the army. It is the key to ensuring that our army faithfully fulfills its mission and supports the great cause of national rejuvenation. War is a continuation of politics, and the army is an armed group that carries out political tasks and must insist that the military be subordinated to politics and strategy to political strategy. In the course of comprehensively building a modern socialist country and comprehensively promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, China's national security faces major challenges. The new-era mission and tasks of ""four strategic supports"" entrusted to our army by the Party and the people profoundly reflect the political attributes of our army and the natural connection between the Party and the army, and require that our army must be politically sound, stand firmly under the Party's banner, resolutely safeguard the security of state power and the system, and resolutely maintain the stability of the political and social situation, and resolutely defend the core interests of the country, and resolutely safeguard the national security. It is resolute in defending the core interests of the country, resolutely safeguarding our overseas interests and maintaining world peace. This necessitates advancing the political building of the army, ensuring that the army maintains absolute loyalty to the Party at all times and under all circumstances, takes the Party's flag as its banner, the Party's direction as its direction, and the Party's will as its will, and faithfully carries out the mission and tasks entrusted to it by the Party and the people in the new era. An important guarantee for realizing the goal of building the army for 100 years on schedule and accelerating the building of the people's army into a world-class army. In the historical process of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and realizing the goal of the second hundred years of struggle, the Party, taking into account the needs of the overall situation of national security and development, and the orderly convergence of the modernization process of the People's Army, has put forward a new ""three-step"" plan for the modernization of the People's Army, which aims to achieve the goal of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army by 2027, basically modernize the national defense and the People's Army by 2035, and comprehensively build a world-class army by the middle of the century. The new ""three-step"" strategy for modernization. To implement this strategic plan, we must scientifically address many difficult and complex challenges and solve many deep-rooted conflicts. This makes it especially necessary to promote the political building of the military, deeply implement Xi Jinping's Thought on Strengthening the Military, deeply implement the military strategic policy for the new era, ensure that the decisions and directives of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and President Xi are carried out without compromise, and lay the ideological cornerstone, inject political souls, and gather spiritual strength for reforming and strengthening the military, strengthening the military with science and technology, and strengthening the military with talents and governing the military in accordance with the law. Withstand all kinds of severe tests, always maintain the nature of the people's army purpose of the nature of the urgent need. Our army was not defeated by unimaginable hardships and powerful enemies during the war years, and was not destroyed by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bombs and the West's ""peaceful evolution"" and ""color revolutions"" during the period of construction, and has been facing the ""four dangers"" and the ""color revolutions"" since the reform and opening up. In the face of the ""four dangers"" and ""four tests"" since the reform and opening-up period, the fundamental reason for not being overwhelmed by all kinds of erroneous thinking and corrupt culture lies in the fact that we have always carried out the strategy of building the army through politics, insisted on building and mastering the army ideologically and politically, and ensured that the people's army would always remain true to its original character. This is the biggest difference between our army and all other armies, and is also the fundamental guarantee that our army always maintains the nature and purpose of the people's army. Today, we want to ensure that the gene remains unchanged, the original heart is the same, we must put the political construction of the army in a more prominent position, continue to inherit the fine traditions of the people's army and the revolutionary bloodline, to build a firm ideological and political foundation of the officers and soldiers to maintain the core, follow the command, so that the army will continue to move forward victoriously in the direction of the party's guidance. Second, the political construction of the army is the foundation of the people's army, but also the new era of the people's army of the strong army to win the war. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has made a strategic plan to promote the political building of the army in the new era, standing on the height of the strategic overall situation of the Party, the State and the army's cause. The People's Army has strengthened its political leadership in unifying its thinking, boosted its morale in removing accumulated shortcomings, and built up the prestige of its political work through inheritance and innovation, so that its ideals and beliefs have become stronger, its political ecology has become purer, and its orientation towards preparation for war has become more distinctive. The Party's absolute leadership of the army has been newly strengthened by taking the casting of the military soul as the core task of building the army politically. The Party's absolute leadership of the army is the ""lifeblood"" of the army, which cannot be shaken at any time or under any circumstances, and must ensure that the troops are absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission has been implemented in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, the pattern of the Military Commission's management of the general administration, the main battle area, and the main construction of the military branch has been firmly established, the functions of the Military Commission's strategic command and strategic management have been further strengthened, and the Party's command and control of the gun has become more scientific in terms of its political design and institutional arrangements. Under the leadership of President Xi, our military has adhered to the organizational line to serve the political line, focused on the main responsibility and main business of preparing for war, strengthened the construction of the Party's organizational system, and transformed the Party's political and organizational advantages into a winning advantage. The Party's political advantage and organizational strength are being transformed into a winning advantage. The army is vigorously focusing on style construction and anti-corruption struggle, and the construction of the Party's wind and clean government has stepped into a new normal. A party that is always energetic is bound to be a party that is brave in self-revolution; an army that dares to fight and win is bound to be an army that is full of cleanliness and righteousness. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, our army has started from the style construction, and with the persistence of always on the road to clean up discipline, anti-corruption and punishment, insisting that corruption must be countered and corruption must be purged, resolutely investigating and dealing with Guo Bohsiung, Xu Caihou, Fang Fenghui, Zhang Yang, and other serious cases of indiscipline and violation of the law, and comprehensively and thoroughly purged of their influence, the party's wind and corruption and anti-corruption construction has made a historic achievement. Through the rectification of ideology, employment, organization and discipline, the People's Army has achieved a new political ecology, a new mental outlook and a new ethos. Firmly establishing combat effectiveness as the only fundamental standard, the political work focuses on the war and achieves new results. The army is first of all a combat team, service and improve combat effectiveness is the fundamental value orientation of political work. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, our army has widely and deeply carried out the ""Great Discussion on the Standard of Combat Effectiveness"", carried out a major investigation and cleanup of the accumulated evils of peace, educated officers and soldiers to strengthen the ideology of fighting in wars, leading soldiers to fight in wars and practicing in wars, and to take seeking and practicing in wars as the main duty and main occupation of soldiers; strengthened the awareness of centering around the center and serving the overall situation, and realized the value that political work should have in building combat effectiveness; and strengthened the awareness of serving the overall situation according to the principle of fighting wars. In accordance with the requirements for fighting battles, it has explored the mechanism of political work to serve and ensure the construction of combat effectiveness and improved the capacity building of political work; created public opinion, work, employment and policy orientations conducive to improving combat effectiveness, and carried out political work through all aspects of combat effectiveness construction, setting up a clear orientation of truly and practically preparing for and fighting battles. Vigorously promoting the innovation and development of political work, and making new progress in the scientific level of informatization and rule of law in political work. Political work is the watchword of our army, the army's greatest characteristic and advantage, and there is no way out and no vitality without innovation in political work. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, our army has adapted to new situations and tasks, studied and grasped the characteristics and laws of political work in the age of information and networks, actively promoted innovation in the thinking and concepts of political work, the mode of operation, the mode of guidance, and the methods and means of work, accelerated the sound improvement of the system of laws and regulations on political work, comprehensively strengthened the Party leadership and Party building work of the army in the new era, and made efforts to cultivate the four ""new era revolutionary soldiers"" and the ""new era revolutionary soldiers"". The ""Four Iron"" troops have been forged by focusing on cultivating ""four revolutionary soldiers of the new era"" and forging ""four iron"" tough troops, so that the theory of political work has been constantly innovated, the content constantly enriched, the channels constantly expanded, and the methods constantly renewed, which has further strengthened the epochal nature of the political work and the appeal of the political work. Third, the heart is like a rock, the journey is like a rainbow. On the new journey, we must comprehensively and accurately learn and understand, unswervingly implement the new era of political army building strategy, always adhere to the ideological and political construction and mastery of the troops, so that the will and strength of the entire army officers and soldiers cohesion in the party's flag, to ensure that the gun always listen to the party command. With the standard of being in the forefront of the in-depth promotion of theoretical armament. Theoretical innovation every one step forward, theoretical armament should follow one step. To comprehensively study, fully grasp, fully implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, in-depth study of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, highlighting Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, educating officers and soldiers to adhere to the reading of the original text, learning the original text, understanding the principles, and strive to master the Marxist position and viewpoint methods throughout, to comprehend the reasoning philosophy embedded in it; adhere to the study of theory and party character exercise, character strengthening combination, through theoretical inculcation, history and history, to ensure that the gun will always be commanded. Combine the study of theory with the exercise of party spirit and character building, strengthen political training through theoretical indoctrination, historical roots, situational awareness, case warning, etc., and play the role of the melting pot of organizational life, and always adhere to the spiritual high ground of the communists and revolutionary soldiers. With the consciousness that everyone is responsible for implementing the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, we have been able to implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. The comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission has a bearing on the fundamental direction of the construction of our army and the development of the cause of strengthening the country and the army in the new era, and it is a serious and significant political responsibility. We should deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", take forging political loyalty as the root, improving political capability as the key, and strengthening the practice of taking up the role as the practical point of departure, so as to further strengthen the political self-awareness of implementing the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. To implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission as the highest political requirements to follow, as the highest political discipline to strictly abide by, so that listening to the command of President Xi, responsible for President Xi, let President Xi rest assured that the military officers and soldiers a high degree of political consciousness. To focus and concentrate on the obsessive service to ensure the preparation for war. The effectiveness of the new era of political construction of the army, in the final analysis, to fall on the combat effectiveness enhancement. To tightly focus on the fundamental function of being able to fight and win wars, refine the specific tasks of political work at all levels in combat, training and non-war military operations, and set up a clear orientation of political work towards the war for the war at all times. To firmly grasp the political work of the times, firmly establish the concept of ""military performance is political performance, the correct concept of political performance is the concept of performance"", to explore the role of political work to ensure the role of combat power construction mechanism, the political work throughout the various aspects of the combat power construction, integrated into the whole process of preparation for the military struggle, to motivate everyone to think about the responsibility of war, do war work, strong war work, and the ability to fight. This will motivate everyone to think about the responsibility of fighting, do the work of fighting, and strengthen the ability to fight, so as to forge a new type of military talent that can take on the important task of winning the war. With unrelenting tenacity, the party organizations at all levels of the army will be strengthened. The strength of the party comes from the organization, and a strong organization is a strong army. To adapt to the new requirements of the new era of the army party construction, to further identify the functions and positioning of the various types of party organizations at all levels, to promote the innovation of the party organization system and operational mechanisms under the new system, and to focus on improving the ability of the party organization's strategic planning ability, the ability to fight the actual preparedness of the party, the ability to reform and innovation, the ability to scientific management, and the ability to grasp the implementation.

We should sincerely listen to the voices of the masses, truly reflect their aspirations, genuinely care about their hardships, consciously learn from the masses, learn from practice, gain correct understanding from the people's creative practice, and turn the correct propositions of the Party into the conscious actions of the masses. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has made a series of important remarks on adhering to the Party's mass line, emphasizing the need to ""walk the Party's mass line in the new era"", which provides a fundamental guideline for the Party's mass work under the new situation. On the new journey, we must always adhere to the supremacy of the people, we must more firmly and consciously adhere to the party's line of the masses, will be carried out in the governance of all practical activities, cohesion of the wisdom and strength of the masses of the people, for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and unity of struggle. The roots of our Party lie in the people, its bloodline in the people, and its strength in the people. The Party in the unity and leadership of the Chinese people in the unremitting struggle of the long-term practice, the formation of ""all for the masses, all rely on the masses, from the masses, to the masses,"" the mass line, is the product of the close combination of the basic principles of Marxism and China's concrete reality, is the cause of the Party continues to move from victory to victory of the important magic weapon. Today, the more ambitious the goal, the more complex the ruling environment, the more arduous the mission, the more need to walk the mass line of the Party in the new era, and rely closely on the people to create historical greatness. An effective way to maintain the flesh and blood connection between the Party and the people. The Party's mass line takes the relationship between the Party and the people as its logical starting point, and builds a strong ideological and emotional foundation for close contact with the masses as its important purpose. It is through the implementation of the Party's mass line that the Party has always maintained its flesh-and-blood ties with the people, and formed the excellent style of close contact with the masses and its greatest political advantage. All the achievements made by the Party in leading the people in their common struggle are the result of practicing the Party's mass line and closely connecting the Party with the people. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has adhered to the principle that the Party is for the public and governs for the people, and has carried out the Party's mass line education and practice activities, the theme of education of ""not forgetting the original heart and keeping the mission in mind"", and the study and education of the Party's history, etc., and has made great efforts to rectify the ""four winds"" and other practices that harm the Party and the cadres. The Party has made great efforts to rectify the ""four winds"" and other outstanding problems that jeopardize the relationship between the Party and the masses, thus laying a solid foundation for the Party and the country to make historic achievements and changes in their undertakings. Practice has fully proved that by walking the Party's mass line in the new era and always maintaining a flesh-and-blood connection with the people, the Party will have the greatest confidence in ruling and prospering the country. A strong guarantee to meet the people's new expectations for a better life. One of the core issues of the Party's mass line is that everything is done in the interest of the people and for the benefit of the general public. Faithfully practicing the Party's mass line and fundamental purposes, and relentlessly striving to realize, safeguard and develop the fundamental interests of the broadest possible number of people is precisely the vivid portrayal of our Party's century-long glorious history. Entering the new era, along with the transformation of the main contradiction in China's society into the contradiction between the people's growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development, the Party's mass line has also been given a new connotation of the times. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has adhered to the people-centered development ideology, united and led the people in their continuous struggle for a better life, won the battle against poverty on schedule, taken many measures to develop people's democracy in the whole process, safeguarded social fairness and justice, and focused on solving the problems of unbalanced and insufficient development and the people's urgent difficulties and sorrows, so as to push the common wealth of all the people to make more obvious and substantial progress. Practice has amply proved that by walking the Party's mass line in the new era, constantly realizing the people's aspirations for a better life, and moving toward the goal of achieving common prosperity, we can unite the tremendous synergy of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way. A key initiative to continuously improve the Party's governing capacity and level. Our Party was founded on adherence to the mass line, and has continued to develop and grow and maintain its vitality and vigor by adhering to the mass line. Adhering to the implementation of the Party's mass line and strengthening the Party's self-construction organically combined with the quality of contacting and serving the masses to test the effectiveness of the Party's self-construction, especially the style of construction and capacity building, is a successful experience in the Party's construction. Entering the new era, the Party has taken adherence to the mass line as the focus point for strengthening style construction and improving its governing capacity, promoted the institutionalization, normalization and long-term effect of serving the masses, innovated ways and means of mass work that meet the requirements of the times, and pushed the Party organizations at all levels and Party members to do practical things for the masses and solve difficult problems, so that the Party's appeal and cohesion have been significantly strengthened. Practice has amply proved that by walking the mass line of the Party in the new era, vigorously carrying forward the fine tradition and style of contacting and serving the masses, and improving the Party's governing ability and level with the times, the Party will be able to build a strong foundation that will make it invincible. President Xi's series of important discussions on the Party's mass line are far-sighted, profound and rich in content, systematically clarifying the fundamental requirements, goals and tasks, and methods and means of carrying out the Party's mass line in the new era, opening up a new realm of the Marxist view of the masses, and realizing an innovative development of the Party's mass line in theory and practice. Adhere to the people-centered development ideology. Adhering to people-centeredness is the basic strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, the Party's profound answer to the question of ""who am I, who am I for, and who am I relying on"", and the fundamental guideline and requirement for implementing the Party's mass line in the new era. We must always put the people in the highest position in our hearts, keep in mind that ""the mountains are the people, and the people are the mountains"", and insist on ruling for the people and relying on the people; comprehensively implement the people-centered development ideology, insist that development is for the people, development relies on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, and unswervingly take the path of common prosperity for all the people; always stand firm on the people's position, and always take the path of common wealth for all the people. We have always stood firm on the people's position, shared the same breath, common destiny and heart with the people, and taken the people's support or not, approval or not, happiness or not, promise or not as the fundamental standard for measuring the success or failure of all work. Take the people's aspirations for a better life as the goal of the struggle. Satisfy the people's growing need for a better life is the concentrated expression of the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people in the new era, and it is the goal and purpose of implementing the Party's mass line in the new era. We must respond to the people's aspirations for a better life, actively respond to the higher expectations in employment, income distribution, education, social security, medical care, housing, old age, and support for the young, grasp the higher demands in democracy, the rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and the environment, and take the enhancement of the people's well-being and the satisfaction of the people's needs as the impetus for advancement and the greatest achievement of the government; vigorously improve the quality and effectiveness of development, and better promote the comprehensive development of people and the progress of society; and vigorously promote the development of the people and the development of society in all aspects.

Fully stimulate the creative power hidden in the people. Adhering to the people's main position and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses to participate in reform and development is the source of strength for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and it is the basic principle and important task of implementing the Party's mass line in the new era. We must rely closely on the people, safeguard the people's rights and interests, and carry out the process of asking the people about politics, needs, and plans throughout the entire process of decision-making, policy-making, and business; respect the people's subjective status and the spirit of creativity, and the people's wishes, experiences, rights, and roles in practical activities, so as to fully stimulate the entrepreneurial zeal and creative vigor of the masses; adhere to the principle of penetrating into the masses and actively participating in the reform and development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is a source of strength for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. We insist on reaching out to the masses and taking root in them, learning from them with an open mind, listening to their voices, and drawing wisdom and strength for reform and development from their practices. Innovate the institutional mechanism and methods of mass work. Adapting to the new situation and new characteristics, and continuously promoting the innovation and development of mass work are the basic requirements and important measures for implementing the Party's mass line in the new era. We must accurately grasp the characteristics and laws of mass work in the new situation, improve and perfect the work system and operation mechanism of up and down linkage, cooperation and joint efforts, promote systematic and networked management, and further enhance the initiative, relevance and effectiveness of mass work; improve and innovate the methods of mass work, strengthen consultation, channeling, communication and exchanges, and pay attention to the use of policy, legal and scientific and technological means, and work hard to make the work more profound, detailed and practical; improve and innovate the methods of mass work, strengthen consultation, channeling, communication and exchange, and emphasize the use of policy, legal and technological means. We will make efforts to make the work deeper, more detailed and more practical; enrich and innovate the carriers of mass work, increase the strength of using network platforms and emerging media, and form an all-round, full-coverage, convenient and efficient pattern of contacting and serving the masses. Third, the Party's mass line in the new era, is a new subject for the past, but also a new test of responsibility. The majority of Party members and cadres, especially the leading cadres at all levels, should strive to enhance the ideological consciousness and action consciousness, and strive to write a new chapter in the practice of the Party's mass line.

军人修养丨努力成为本职工作的行家里手 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：贾乾 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-23 06:38:38 0,努力成为本职工作的行家里手 ■贾 乾 ●对领导干部而言，提高专业素质和领导才能至关重要。只有不断提高专业化水平，才能更好胜任领导工作 习主席在中央党校建校90周年庆祝大会暨2023年春季学期开学典礼上的重要讲话中强调，“履行好党和人民赋予的新时代职责使命，领导干部必须全面增强各方面本领，努力成为本职工作的行家里手”。习主席的重要讲话既体现了对各级领导干部的殷切期望和鼓励鞭策，同时也为各级领导干部履行好党和人民赋予的新时代使命责任提供了遵循，指明了方向。 领导干部是党和人民事业的骨干、发挥关键作用的“关键少数”，是一个领域、一个部门、一个地方的决策者和管理者，其专业素质的高低、领导才能的强弱，直接影响着决策水平、管理成效和发展成果。因而，对领导干部而言，提高专业素质和领导才能至关重要。当前，我们面临的外部环境不稳定性不确定性上升，国内改革发展稳定需要解决的问题复杂多样，既有不少长期积累的深层次矛盾和问题，又有前进道路上不断出现的新矛盾新问题。面对严峻复杂的形势和艰巨繁重的任务，要让党的二十大擘画的宏伟蓝图变为现实，以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，各级领导干部肩上的担子会更重，需要面对的风险挑战会更多，对能力素质的要求会更高。这就需要各级领导干部增强各方面本领，尤其是推动高质量发展本领、服务群众本领、防范化解风险本领。同时，要加强斗争精神和斗争本领养成，着力增强防风险、攻难关、迎挑战、抗打压能力。只有不断提高专业化水平，才能更好胜任领导工作。 发展是党执政兴国的第一要务。没有坚实的物质技术基础，就不可能全面建成社会主义现代化强国。目前，我国经济已进入高质量发展阶段，发展质量摆在更加突出的位置。高质量发展的关键在人，在于各级领导干部是否有揽高质量发展“瓷器活”的决心和解决实际问题的“金刚钻”。对军队领导干部来讲，只有具备推动高质量发展的本领，才能更好地实现我军建设发展质量变革、效能变革、动力变革。各级领导干部要扣牢如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标、加快把人民军队建成世界一流军队，把高质量发展放在首位，切实树立起实战、创新、体系、集约、融合等新理念，保持良好的战略素养、军事素养、科技素养，真正适应科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，不断向深化改革、科技创新、战略管理要质效，在实践中提升推动军队建设高质量发展本领。 全心全意为人民服务是我们党的宗旨，各级领导干部尤其要自觉践行以人民为中心的发展思想，走好新时代党的群众路线，下大气力解决群众急难愁盼问题，始终把人民拥护不拥护、赞成不赞成、高兴不高兴、答应不答应作为制定各项方针政策的出发点和落脚点，作为判断各项工作成败得失的重要标准。领导干部要深切理解“服务”的含义，真正主动为群众着想、积极与群众打成一片。“来自人民、为了人民，始终与人民血肉相连、生死与共，是我军的制胜之本、力量之源。”军队各级领导干部应当深刻认识这一点，始终牢记并全力践行全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，在以身作则服务人民的同时，也要教育引导官兵热爱军营、扎根军营、建功军营，像张思德、雷锋那样为人民服务，在群众看得见的地方要尽职尽责，在群众看不到的地方更要耐得住寂寞，科学刻苦训练，提高胜战本领，用无私奉献守护人民群众的幸福平安。 提升防范化解风险本领，加强斗争精神和斗争本领养成是干部历练成长的必经之路。习主席反复强调，全党必须高度重视风险防范问题。面对风险挑战，面对来自外部的各种遏制打压，我们要保持定力，骨头要硬，腰杆子要挺直，决不能腿肚子发软，在涉及国家核心利益问题上必须寸步不让。当前，干部队伍整体上是好的，但也要清醒认识到，面对“四大考验”“四种危险”，一些干部特别是年轻干部还存在斗争精神不足、斗争经验缺乏、斗争本领不强等问题。有的有“软骨病”，不愿斗争；有的患“恐惧症”，不敢斗争；有的本领不过硬，不善于斗争……这些都与当前形势任务和发展要求格格不入。前进道路上不可能一帆风顺，要准备经受风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的考验，如何应对重大挑战、抵御重大风险、克服重大阻力、解决重大矛盾，是摆在各级领导干部面前的一道必答题。党员干部特别是领导干部应当增强忧患意识，居安思危，未雨绸缪，善于审时度势，全面准确研判风险挑战。要经受严格的思想淬炼、政治历练、实践锻炼，在复杂严峻的斗争中经风雨、见世面，壮筋骨、长才干，真正把自己锻造成为烈火真金。要做到在大是大非面前敢于亮剑，在矛盾冲突面前敢于迎难而上，在危机困难面前敢于挺身而出，在歪风邪气面前敢于坚决斗争，以担当作为的行动奋进新征程、建功新时代。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230326000352/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16211423.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230326163510/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16211423.html,2023-03-26 0:00:00,Soldier cultivation丨strive to become an expert in their own work Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Jia Qian Responsibility：Huang Min 2023-03-23 06:38:38 0,"The first time I saw this, I was in the middle of a long journey, and I was able to get to the top of my game.

President Xi's important speech not only reflects the high expectations and encouragement for leading cadres at all levels, but also provides guidelines and points out the direction for leading cadres at all levels to fulfill the mission and responsibility of the new era entrusted to them by the Party and the people. Leading cadres are the backbone of the Party and the people's cause, play a key role in the ""key few"", is a field, a department, a local decision makers and managers, the professional quality of its high and low, the strength of leadership, directly affecting the level of decision-making, management effectiveness and development results. Thus, for leading cadres, it is crucial to improve professional quality and leadership skills. At present, we are facing a rising instability and uncertainty in the external environment, the domestic reform, development and stabilization of complex and diverse issues that need to be resolved, there are a lot of long-accumulated deep-rooted contradictions and problems, as well as new contradictions and new problems that continue to emerge on the road ahead. In the face of the severe and complicated situation and the arduous and heavy task, to make the grand blueprint drawn by the 20th Party Congress a reality, and to promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in a comprehensive way with Chinese-style modernization, leading cadres at all levels will have heavier burdens on their shoulders, and need to face more risks and challenges, and have higher requirements for their abilities and qualities. This requires leading cadres at all levels to strengthen their abilities in all aspects, especially in promoting high-quality development, serving the masses, and preventing and resolving risks. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the spirit of struggle and struggle skills, and strive to enhance the ability to prevent risks, attack difficulties, meet challenges and resist pressure. Only by constantly improving the level of specialization can we be better equipped for leadership work. Development is the Party's first priority in governing the country. Without a solid material and technological foundation, it is impossible to fully build a strong socialist modernization country. At present, China's economy has entered the stage of high-quality development, and the quality of development has been placed in a more prominent position. The key to high-quality development lies in the people, in whether the leading cadres at all levels have the determination to take high-quality development ""porcelain work"" and solve practical problems ""diamond"". For the military leading cadres, only with the ability to promote high-quality development, in order to better realize the quality of our military construction and development changes, efficiency changes, power changes. Leaders and cadres at all levels should put the first priority on high-quality development by realizing the goal of building the army for one hundred years and accelerating the building of the people's army into a world-class army, effectively setting up new concepts such as actual combat, innovation, system, intensification, and fusion, and maintaining good strategic, military, and scientific and technological literacy, so that they can truly adapt to the changes in science and technology, the changes in warfare, and the changes in opponents, and constantly work towards deepening reform, scientific and technological innovation, and strategic management. We will continue to seek quality and effectiveness in deepening reform, scientific and technological innovation, and strategic management, and enhance our ability to promote the high-quality development of military construction in practice. To serve the people wholeheartedly is the purpose of our party, leading cadres at all levels, in particular, should consciously practice the people-centered development ideology, take the mass line of the party in the new era, make great efforts to solve the urgent problems of the masses, and always take the people's support or not, approval or not, happy or not, promise or not as the starting and ending point for formulating policies and guidelines, and as an important criterion for judging the success of each job. Important standard. Leading cadres should deeply understand the meaning of ""service"", really take the initiative to think for the masses, and actively mingle with the masses. ""Coming from the people, for the people, always linked to the people by flesh and blood, living and dying together, is the basis of victory and the source of strength of our army."" Leaders and cadres at all levels of the army should deeply understand this, always remember and fully practice the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, and while serving the people by example, they should also educate and guide their officers and soldiers to love the barracks, take root in the barracks, and build up the barracks, and to serve the people like Zhang Side, Lei Feng, and to be dutiful and conscientious where the masses are visible, and even more so where the masses are invisible, and to be able to endure the loneliness, and to train scientifically and diligently, and to Improve the ability to win the war, with selfless dedication to guard the people's happiness and peace. Enhance the ability to prevent and defuse risks, strengthen the spirit of struggle and struggle skills is a must for cadres to grow up. President Xi has repeatedly emphasized that the whole party must attach great importance to risk prevention. In the face of risks and challenges, and in the face of all kinds of containment and suppression from the outside, we must maintain our strength, our bones must be hard, our backs must be straight, we must not be weak in the legs and stomachs, and we must not give in on issues involving the core interests of the country. At present, the cadres on the whole is good, but we should also realize that, in the face of the ""four tests"" ""four dangers"", some cadres, especially young cadres, there is still a lack of spirit of struggle, lack of experience in the struggle, the struggle is not strong and other issues. Some have ""cartilage disease"", unwilling to fight; some suffer from ""phobia"", do not dare to fight; some skills are not good, not good at fighting ...... These are with the current situation and task and development requirements These are all incompatible with the current situation and task and development requirements. The road ahead can not be smooth sailing, to be prepared to withstand high winds and waves or even shocking test, how to cope with major challenges, resist major risks, to overcome major resistance, to resolve major contradictions, is in front of the leading cadres at all levels of a must-answer question. Party members and cadres, especially the leading cadres should enhance the sense of anxiety, in peace and security, saving for a rainy day, good at judging the situation, comprehensive and accurate research and judgment of risk challenges. To undergo rigorous ideological refinement, political experience, practical exercise, in the complexity and severity of the struggle in the storm, see the world, strengthen the muscles and bones, long talent, really forging themselves into a blazing gold. To do in front of the major right and wrong dare to sword, in front of conflict dare to rise to the challenge, in front of the crisis and difficulties dare to stand up, in front of the crooked and evil dare to fight resolutely, to take action as the action of the new journey, to build a new era.","The article discusses the importance of becoming an expert in one's own work for leading cadres. It emphasizes that in the current situation of high-level decision-making and management effectiveness, it is crucial for cadres to improve their professional quality and leadership skills. President Xi has highlighted the need to make great efforts to become an expert in their own work and fully understand the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.

National defense education for all is a fundamental project for building a consolidated national defense and a strong people's army, an important part of the Party's propaganda and ideological work, and an effective way to promote the spirit of patriotism and enhance the national defense awareness of all people. Strengthening national defense education for the whole people in the new era will help guide the whole society to consciously fulfill their national defense obligations and take practical actions to care for, support and participate in national defense construction, thus bringing together the strong will and power to strengthen the country and the army. Accurately grasp the situation and tasks of national defense education in the new era Strengthening national defense education for all and enhancing the concept of national defense for all is an important strategic issue to which the Party and the State have always attached great importance. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, President Xi has attached great importance to national defense education for all people, and made a series of important decisions and deployments. The awareness of national defense among all people has been increasing, and the social atmosphere of caring for and supporting national defense and military construction has become stronger. In realizing the goal of building the army for 100 years, national defense education for all people has a glorious mission and arduous task. Fully recognize the overall significance of deepening national defense education. The country can not stand without defense, and the people are restless without soldiers. National defense education for all is the basic project of building a consolidated national defense and a strong people's army, which is conducive to enhancing the concept of national defense of the entire population and consolidating the ideological consensus. National defense education for all is an important means of promoting the spirit of patriotism, and by integrating it into the socialist core value system and spiritual civilization construction, it is conducive to cultivating national sentiments, enhancing the sense of anxiety, and guiding all people to unite and strive for the country's long-lasting peace and security and the nation's great rejuvenation.

Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military provides a fundamental guideline for national defense education, which is the ""outline"" and ""soul"" of national defense education in the new era, and must be used as a fundamental guide to set the right direction for national defense education. The great practice of strengthening the army in the new era has enriched the new content of national defense education for the whole nation, and we must vigorously publicize the great achievements of the people's army, which has a new system, a new structure, a new pattern, and a new outlook, on the basis of good revolutionary tradition. The expansion of the national security field has opened up a new classroom for national defense education for the whole nation, and we must extend the educational tentacles to new threats and new fields while paying attention to traditional security, so as to further enhance the systematic, contemporary and targeted nature of national defense education for the whole nation. Efforts to give full play to the advantages of the new system of national defense education According to the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee, the deepening of the reform of national defense education for all has been comprehensively implemented, realizing the historic change and strategic reshaping of the leadership system and working mechanism.

自耦合作战：未来联合作战新趋势 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：彭海 刘孝良 张付林 责任编辑：黄敏 2023-03-30 06:52:00 0,自耦合作战：未来联合作战新趋势 ■彭 海 刘孝良 张付林 引  言 面对科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，传统战争中形成的固定编组、任务衡定、树形指挥的作战模式将难以适应战场需要，亟需转变观念，创新实施自耦合作战。所谓自耦合作战，是指依托大数据、云计算、智能化的网络信息体系支撑，参战力量围绕指挥员意图，基于任务目标与作战需求，打破地域、建制和领域限制，即时感知态势、快速动态组群、自主匹配任务，聚合体系优势，最大限度地释放体系作战能力。 用最合适力量遂行最恰当任务，达到作战效能最佳释放，历来是战争指导的最高境界 翻开人类战争史的画卷，耦合释能与战争发展相生相伴、与指挥协同紧密关联。变化的是耦合组织形式——从“他耦合”向“自耦合”演进；不变的是耦合价值追求——追求作战效能最佳释放，寻求最佳作战效益。 冷兵器时代作战，双方摆成简单队形，展开面对面厮杀，战争指导者往往依靠自身的表率作用或简单的组织，来实现不同的作战力量、作战行动的有效配合，从而最大限度地释放作战能量。从这种意义上看，冷兵器时代作战，主要是通过将帅的发号施令，即“他耦合”来组织能量释放。 热兵器时代，随着打击距离的增大，火炮、飞机、坦克、舰艇等武器装备相继出现，作战行动更加复杂，相互配合更加重要，必须由指挥员及其指挥机关进行周密战前筹划，依靠有线/无线通信实施战中调控。作战效能释放，主要依靠指挥员确定的力量编组、任务分配、行动时序、支援保障来实现，即仍然没有摆脱“他耦合”束缚。但由于战场态势的快速变化，战前筹划组织已经难以适应实战需求。因应战场不确定性，着眼发挥任务部队主观能动性，分散指挥、委托式指挥、任务式指挥等指挥方式相继出现。从能量释放角度看，这些指挥方式可以作为基于指挥授权实施的自耦合作战。 现代联合作战，无人力量崭露头角，远程精打成为新锐，隐身高速渐成主力，多维战场全纵深布势，多元力量混合发力，多域行动协同增效，虽然作战效能释放还依靠“他耦合”，但更加注重“自耦合”。近年外军提出的“马赛克战”概念，旨在强调通过技术构架使已有系统灵活组网并快速配置，在指挥官指定时间与地点提供期望的作战能力。近年来，局部战争和武装冲突中，有的国家军队基于网络信息体系，重构杀伤链路，依网发布任务，作战单元实施“接单式”打击，已经初现自耦合作战端倪。 信息化智能化技术为作战效能最佳释放提供了手段支撑，强制性要求向自耦合作战迁移 随着大数据、云计算、人工智能、量子通信等新技术的广泛运用，使作战力量全维分布、异质同构，作战资源极限运用、按需释放成为可能，强制推动作战方式向自耦合作战转变。 战场态势即时感知为自耦合作战提供了“慧眼”。在信息网络技术支撑下，天基监控、空中预警、海上探测、水下侦监、地面感知等多域多维多元预警侦察手段，实时获取战场情报信息，高效处理融合各类信息，使得分布于各领域、全纵深的作战单元可以获得完整、精准、实时的战场态势，使整个作战体系可以清晰感知潜在威胁、准确判断打击目标，为其自主实施作战行动提供了“千里眼”。 跨域行动实时打击为自耦合作战提供了“臂膀”。外军提出的“多域战”概念，其实质是集多域之所长克他域之所短。近几场局部战争中，外军实践的跨代融合、体系抗击、以分抗散，以无人集群打有人高价值目标等大都体现了多域作战的这一非对称制衡理念。智能技术发展将进一步改变这种作战方式，各类作战单元“感知—决策—打击—评估”链路将实现从“传感器到射手”的瞬间传递，打击准备实现“零预热”，“发现即摧毁”得以真正实现。这种跨域行动“零反应”，为实施自耦合作战提供了“拳头”。 高度智能决策系统为自耦合作战提供了“大脑”。随着人工智能的演进，参谋人员的辅助决策、指挥控制和评估推演等“外脑”功能，将更多地被人工智能“智脑”所取代，泛在的“智能参谋”将取代庞大的参谋人员群体。在智能化加持下，力量编配将向基于任务的实时组合转变，力量选用将向并域聚优、体系选优、按需择优转变，作战行动将向即时反应、同步协作、精准释能转变，指挥体系将重塑为星点分布、权限不同的指挥架构，指挥方式向任务下达、节点把控转变，打击力、信息力、防护力将在最需要的时机、以最恰当的方式释放于最合适的目标上，以实现作战潜力的最大转化。 网络信息体系为自耦合作战提供了“经络”。随着信息技术的发展，网络信息体系的网聚功能较之以往任何时代都更加强大，分散配置的作战力量、作战单元、武器装备基于各种信息链路成为地位平等网络信息节点，可无差别获取和使用信息。正如人体的经络一样，网络信息体系这一特性，不仅为指挥机构下达指令、调控行动提供便利，也为作战单元输送血液、提供养分。基于网络信息体系，联合作战指挥机构不仅可以云端发布任务，真正实现“去中心化”，也可监控战场态势、感知行动效果、调配力量资源；作战单元可以进行“接单式”任务选择，基于网络智脑进行自主式行动，最大限度地降低力量内耗，形成局部最优作战能力。 努力探索战略战役上“他耦合”为主导、战术上“自耦合”为主体的作战行动之道 胜利总是向那些能预见战争特性变化的人微笑。因应科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，必须立足当前部队实际、前瞻未来作战发展，加紧推动观念更新、训练转型、条件建设，向着实战贴近再贴近。 积极推动作战理念更新。当前，智能无人作战力量已经大量运用于现代战场，联合作战正向内聚式融合快速发展。应突破掌控平台利器观念束缚向体系聚优转变，突出战中快速组合力量、规划行动，打造模块化韧性强的作战体系；应突破传统作战资源多少观念束缚向微群多能转变，打造高度智能化作战群，推动作战体系向自适应、系统涌现功能转变；应突破传统统揽统管观念束缚向任务指挥转变，基于态势定任务、定目标、定力量，推动上级卡点指挥、多级并行实施的行动方式；应突破传统协同观念束缚向自主作战转变，基于任务编配，基于规则配合，基于态势协作，推动作战能量最佳释放。 加紧完善作战规则体系。推动实现自耦合作战，离不开对体系内部各作战力量统一行动、互相融合、协调配合的规则约束。这些规则，既是智能化辅助决策系统的必备前提，也是避免行动随意、协同失调的关键。应建立效能优先规则，即根据多域作战单元作战能力、打击效果，以瘫体失能成效为力量选用标准，为不同域、不同质作战力量融合提供依据；应建立力量主导规则，即明确不同力量间协同关系，按任务、分目标、逐领域建立力量主导规则，为并域行动时序、配合提供依据；应建立授权性规则，即作战单元根据指挥员授权履行某一领域、某一方向或某一行动指挥权责，为响应战场、指挥下沉提供依据；应建立调控性规则，明确指挥员调控时机、调控方式、调控权限，确保作战始终按指挥员意图实施。 着力建强信息支撑网系。云联支撑的联合作战体系，是实现体系对抗、体系聚优的前提基础。应着眼信息高速流转，打造贯通军种壁垒、共享情报信息、衔接作战单元的云态战场网链，为作战力量分散部署、依网重组、跨域融合提供支撑；应瞄准智能决策，加速研发信息快速处理、方案快速生成的智能辅助模型，为任务云端发布、接单智能匹配提供支撑；应健全数据资源池，区分敌我作战目标、平台装备、作战单元、作战群，建设数据新鲜保真、动态更新的资源池，为任务行动提供客观支撑。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230331235940/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16213160.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230330033552/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16213160.html,2023-04-01 0:00:00,Self-coupled Combat: A New Trend in Future Joint Warfare Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Peng Hai Liu Xiaoliang Zhang Fulin Responsibility: Huang Min 2023-03-30 06:52:00 0,"Self-coupled combat: a new trend in future joint operations ■ Peng Hai Liu Xiaoliang Zhang Fu Lin Introduction In the face of changes in science and technology, changes in the war, changes in the adversary, the traditional war in the formation of a fixed formation, the task of weighing, the tree command mode of operation will be difficult to adapt to the battlefield, the urgent need to change the concept of the implementation of the innovation of self-coupled combat. The so-called self-coupled combat, refers to relying on big data, cloud computing, intelligent network information system support, combat forces around the commander's intention, based on the mission objectives and operational needs, breaking the geographical, establishment and field restrictions, instantaneous situational awareness, rapid dynamic grouping, independent matching tasks, aggregation of system advantages, maximize the release of the system's operational capabilities. With the most appropriate force to attempt the most appropriate task, to achieve the best release of combat effectiveness, has always been the highest realm of war guidance Open the scroll of the history of human war, the coupling of release and the development of the war is born with each other, and command and coordination is closely related. What has changed is the form of coupling organization - from ""other coupling"" to ""self-coupling"" evolution; unchanged is the pursuit of coupling value - the pursuit of the best release of combat effectiveness, seeking to achieve the best release of combat effectiveness, has always been the highest level of war guidance. -Pursue the best release of combat effectiveness, and seek the best combat efficiency. Cold war era combat, the two sides into a simple formation, face-to-face killing, war guides often rely on their own role as an example or simple organization, to achieve different combat forces, combat operations, effective coordination, so as to maximize the release of combat energy. In this sense, the cold war era combat, mainly through the commander-in-chief's orders, that is, ""his coupling"" to organize the release of energy. In the era of hot weapons, with the increase of striking distance, artillery, aircraft, tanks, ships and other weapons and equipment appeared one after another, the combat action is more complex, more important to cooperate with each other, it must be by the commander and his command organ to carry out careful pre-war planning, relying on wired/wireless communication to implement the regulation of the war. The release of combat effectiveness mainly relies on the commander to determine the formation of forces, task allocation, action sequence, support and security to realize, that is, still not free from the ""other coupling"" bondage. However, due to the rapid change of battlefield situation, it is difficult to adapt the pre-war planning organization to the actual battle demand. In response to the uncertainty of the battlefield, with an eye to playing the subjective initiative of the task force, decentralized command, entrusted command, task command and other command methods have emerged one after another. From the perspective of energy release, these command methods can be used as self-coupled operations based on command authorization. Modern joint operations, unmanned forces emerging, long-range precision fighting has become a new elite, stealth and high-speed gradually become the main force, multi-dimensional battlefield full-depth deployment, mixed forces, multi-domain action synergies, although the release of combat effectiveness still rely on ""his coupling"", but pay more attention to the ""self-coupling The first is the ""self-coupling"". In recent years, the concept of ""mosaic war"" put forward by foreign armies is aimed at emphasizing the flexible networking and rapid configuration of existing systems through the technical framework, and providing the desired combat capability at the time and place designated by the commander. In recent years, in local wars and armed conflicts, some national armies, based on the network information system, reconfigure the kill link, release tasks according to the network, and the combat unit implements the ""take-order"" strike, which has already appeared the beginning of self-coupled combat. Informatization and intelligent technology for the best release of combat effectiveness provides the means to support the mandatory requirements to the migration of self-coupled combat With the extensive use of big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and other new technologies, so that the full-dimensional distribution of combat forces, heterogeneous isomorphism, the limit of combat resources, the release of on-demand to become a possibility to force to promote the mode of operation to the transformation of the self-coupled combat. Instant perception of battlefield situation provides ""eyes"" for self-coupled combat. Under the support of information network technology, space-based monitoring, airborne early warning, maritime detection, underwater surveillance, ground perception and other multi-dimensional multi-dimensional early warning and reconnaissance means, real-time access to battlefield intelligence information, and efficient processing and integration of various types of information, so that the distribution of combat units in various fields, the full depth of the battlefield can obtain a complete, accurate and real-time battlefield situation, so that the entire combat system can clearly perceive the potential threat, accurately judge The combat system can clearly perceive potential threats, accurately determine the target, and provide ""clairvoyance"" for its autonomous implementation of combat operations. Cross-domain action real-time combat for self-coupled combat provides the ""arm"". Foreign military put forward the concept of ""multi-domain war"", in essence, is a set of multi-domain strengths of the short of other domains. In recent local wars, the foreign military practice of cross-generation integration, system resistance, to points against the scattered, unmanned clusters to fight people with high-value targets, most of the multi-domain combat this asymmetric checks and balances concept. Intelligent technology development will further change this way of combat, all types of combat units ""perception - decision-making - strike - assessment"" link will be realized from ""sensor to shooter Instantaneous transmission from ""sensor to shooter"", strike preparation to achieve ""zero warm-up"", ""found that is destroyed"" to be truly realized. This cross-domain action ""zero reaction"", for the implementation of self-coupled combat provides a ""fist"". Highly intelligent decision-making system provides a ""brain"" for self-coupled combat. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, the staff's auxiliary decision-making, command and control and assessment of the deduction of the ""external brain"" function, will be more by artificial intelligence ""brain"" to replace the ubiquitous ""intelligence staff The ""intelligent staff"" will replace the large group of staff officers. Under the intelligent support, the power allocation will be transformed to the real-time combination based on the task, the power selection will be transformed to the concurrent domain polymerization, system selection, according to the need to choose the best, the combat action will be transformed to the immediate response, synchronous collaboration, accurate release of energy, the command system will be reshaped to the distribution of star points, the authority of the different command structure, the command mode to the task to the command, the node to control the transformation of the striking force, the information force, the protection force will be in the most necessary time, in the most appropriate way to release the power. Strike force, information force and protection force will be released in the most appropriate way at the most needed time and on the most suitable target to realize the maximum transformation of combat potential. Network information system provides ""meridian"" for self-coupled combat. With the development of information technology, the network information system of the network aggregation function of any previous era is more powerful, decentralized configuration of combat forces, combat units, weapons and equipment based on a variety of information links to become equal status network information nodes, non-discriminatory access to and use of information. Just like the human body's meridians, this feature of the network information system not only provides convenience for the commanding organization to give orders and regulate actions, but also transports blood and provides nutrients for the combat units. Based on the network information system, the joint combat command organization can not only release tasks in the cloud to truly realize ""decentralization"", but also monitor the battlefield situation, perceive the effect of the action, and deploy forces and resources; the combat unit can carry out the ""take-over"" task selection, based on the network brain to carry out autonomous actions, and the network intelligence brain to carry out autonomous actions. The combat units can make ""order-taking"" mission choices and carry out autonomous actions based on the network brain to minimize the internal consumption of power and form the optimal local combat capability. Efforts to explore the strategic battle ""other coupling"" as the dominant, tactical ""self-coupling"" as the main body of the combat action Victory always smiles to those who can foresee the changes in the characteristics of war. In response to changes in science and technology, changes in war, changes in opponents, must be based on the actual current troops, looking forward to the future development of combat, and step up to promote the concept of updating, training transformation, conditions of construction, close to the actual combat close again. Actively promote the combat concept update. Currently, intelligent unmanned combat forces have been heavily utilized in the modern battlefield, joint operations are rapidly developing towards cohesive integration. Should break through the control of platforms and tools conceptual constraints to the system of poly-optimal transformation, highlighting the rapid combination of forces in the war, planning operations, to create a modular and resilient combat system; should break through the traditional conceptual constraints of the number of combat resources to the micro-group multi-purpose transformation to create a high degree of intelligent combat group, to promote the combat system to the adaptive, systematic emergence of the function of the transformation; should break through the traditional conceptual constraints of the unity of control and unity of control to the task of the command of the transformation based on situational and operational requirements. It should break through the traditional conceptual constraints of coordination to change to autonomous combat, based on the task allocation, based on the rules of cooperation, based on the posture of collaboration, to promote the best release of combat energy. Step up to improve the combat rules system. Promote the realization of self-coupled combat, inseparable from the system of internal combat forces unified action, mutual integration, coordination and coordination of the rules of constraints. These rules are the prerequisite for the intelligent decision-making system, but also the key to avoid arbitrary action and coordination disorders. Efficiency priority rules should be established, that is, according to the multi-domain combat unit combat capability, combat effectiveness, to paralyze the body incapacitation effectiveness of the force selection criteria for different domains, different quality of the integration of combat forces to provide the basis for the force should be established to dominate the rules, that is, clear synergistic relationship between the different forces, according to the task, sub-targets, field by field to establish the force dominant rules for the concurrent domains of the action sequence, with the basis for the establishment of the rule should be established authorization, that is, combat units under the commander's authorization to perform their duties. That is, the combat unit under the commander's authorization to perform a certain field, a certain direction or an action command authority and responsibility, in response to the battlefield, command sinking to provide a basis; should be established to regulate the rules, a clear commander regulating the timing, regulating the mode of regulating, regulating the authority to ensure that the operation is always in accordance with the intention of the commander to implement. Invest in building a strong information support network system. The joint operation system supported by the cloud link is the prerequisite foundation for realizing system confrontation and system aggregation.

The 20th Party Congress listed ""promoting the building of a community of human destiny"" as one of the essential requirements for Chinese-style modernization, further revealing the significance of promoting the building of a community of human destiny and the practical path. In this new era and new journey, we should deeply understand and comprehend the rich theoretical connotation, great contemporary value and far-reaching historical significance of promoting the building of a community of human destiny, and firmly hold up the great banner of building a community of human destiny, so as to join hands with people of all countries in the world to create a better future. The report of the 20th Party Congress emphasized that ""China has always adhered to the foreign policy tenet of maintaining world peace and promoting common development, and is committed to promoting the building of a community of human destiny."" This year marks the 10th anniversary of President Xi Jinping's proposal to build a community of human destiny, and in March 2013, at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, President Xi scientifically grasped the laws of development of human society, and explicitly stated that ""in this world, the degree of interconnection and interdependence among countries has deepened as never before, and human beings are living in the same global village and in the same space and time where history and reality meet, becoming more and more interconnected and interdependent. Human beings are living in the same global village, in the same space and time where history and reality converge, and are increasingly becoming a community of destiny in which you are with me and I am with you"". The introduction of the important concept of building a community of human destiny has provided a Chinese program for jointly addressing global challenges and creating a better future for mankind. A profound answer to the question of ""where is the world going and what should mankind do?"" Ten years ago, in the face of the great changes that the world had not seen in a century, President Xi, with the outstanding political wisdom, extraordinary theoretical courage and strong mission bearing of a Marxist statesman, thinker and strategist, profoundly pondered ""what kind of world and how to build this world"" and ""what kind of world and how to build this world"". What kind of world and how to build it"", made a profound answer to the question of ""where is the world going and what should mankind do?"", creatively put forward the important concept of building a community of human destiny, and put forward the proposals of taking the road of peaceful development, building a new type of international relations, and building the ""Belt and Road"" together. ""Belt and Road"", deepening and expanding the global partnership of equality, openness and cooperation, adhering to genuine multilateralism and a series of other important theses, which have built up a scientific theoretical system that is far-sighted, systematic, profound and perfect, providing a fundamental guideline for China's diplomacy, and pointing out the direction of the world's development at this turning point in history. It has pointed out the direction for world development at the turning point of history. Over the past 10 years, under the guidance of Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought, which takes building a community of human destiny as its core concept, China's foreign affairs have made important contributions to the noble cause of world peace and development, actively contributed Chinese wisdom to solving the common challenges of mankind, and conducted all-round, wide-field and multi-level active exploration of this important concept to guide the practice of international relations, and achieved important results. The concept of building a community of human destiny has been incorporated into the resolutions, declarations and outcome documents of the United Nations and other important international and multilateral mechanisms, demonstrating strong international influence, appeal and shaping power, and is increasingly gaining popularity around the world. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of President Xi's proposal of the concept of building a community of human destiny, comprehensively studying and comprehending the great significance of this important concept in terms of time, theory, practice and world significance is an essential course for in-depth study and implementation of the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and Xi Jinping's thought on diplomacy, an essential course for accurately grasping the historic achievements of China's foreign work in the past 10 years of the new era and an essential course for striving for the new journey and pushing forward the new development. It is also a necessary course to strive for a new journey and promote new development. Reflections on China in the Face of Changes in the World, the Times, and History Accurately assessing the situation is the prerequisite for solving problems and carrying out work, and it is also the key to the CPC's struggle for more than a hundred years and its continuous progress from victory to triumph. The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change. In the face of the question of the times, ""What's wrong with the world and what should we do?"", every responsible politician must answer the questions of the times and make historical choices with confidence, courage and commitment. President Xi profoundly pointed out that in order to grasp the international situation, it is necessary to establish a correct view of history, the overall situation and role. This provides a scientific method for us to accurately analyze the world situation and our country's historical orientation. As early as December 5, 2012, President Xi pointed out during a discussion with 20 representatives of foreign experts from 16 countries working in China at the Great Hall of the People that the international community is increasingly becoming a community of destiny in which you are one of us and I am one of you. In the face of the complex situation of the world economy and global problems, no country can stand alone, which requires all countries to be in the same boat, to work together in harmony, to take into account the reasonable concerns of other countries while pursuing their own interests, to promote the common development of all countries while seeking their own development, to establish a new type of more equal and balanced global partnership for development, to enhance the common interests of mankind, and to work together for the building of a better homeland of the Earth. We will build a new, more equal and balanced global partnership for development, promote the common interests of humankind and jointly build a better global home. Since then, the phrase ""you have me and I have you"" to describe the common destiny of all countries has struck a chord in the international community. Over the past 10 years, based on the scientific judgment of the development and change of the international situation and the correct grasp of China's own direction, President Xi has made all-round, systematic and scientific elaborations on building a community of human destiny on various important occasions, constantly enriching and deepening the connotation and elements of building a community of human destiny, and also leading the international community's cognition of the concept of building a community of human destiny to a deeper and deeper level. In March 2013, President Xi delivered an important speech at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, pointing out that ""in this world, peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation have become the trend of the times; the old colonial system has collapsed; the bloc confrontation of the Cold War era no longer exists; and no country or group of countries can dominate world affairs on their own any more"". In today's world, countries are interdependent and in solidarity, and it has become a consensus that human society is an interdependent community. In September 2015, President Xi pointed out in his important speech during the general debate of the 70th United Nations General Assembly that ""'The way of the road is also the way of the world.' Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are the common values of all mankind and the noble goals of the United Nations. The goal is far from being accomplished, and we still have to work hard."" The goal of this endeavor is to ""build a community of human destiny."" In January 2017, President Xi's speech at the Palais des Nations in Geneva comprehensively discussed the concept of building a community of human destiny, starting from the international situation in which ""mankind is in a period of great development, great changes and great adjustments"", and from the fact that ""the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation has become even stronger"" and ""challenges are still far from being realized"". Starting from the international situation, in which mankind is in a period of great development and change, and from the fact that ""the tide of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation has become stronger in the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation"" and that ""the challenges are endless and the risks are increasing"", it is pointed out that ""there is only one Earth in the universe, and mankind has a common homeland"". At the outset, he pointed out the necessity, importance and feasibility of building a community of human destiny, and comprehensively elaborated on the concept of building a community of human destiny - putting forward the basic guidelines for building a community of human destiny. President Xi pointed out that from the principles of equality and sovereignty established by the Peace of Westphalia more than 360 years ago to the spirit of international humanitarianism established by the Geneva Conventions more than 150 years ago; from the four major purposes and seven principles specified in the United Nations Charter more than 70 years ago to the five principles of peaceful coexistence advocated at the Bandung Conference more than 60 years ago, a series of universally recognized principles have been accumulated in the evolution of international relations. These principles should be the basic guidelines for building a community of human destiny. The overall goal and direction of efforts to build a community of human destiny are proposed. President Xi emphasized adhering to dialogue and consultation to build a world of lasting peace; adhering to building and sharing to build a world of universal security; adhering to win-win cooperation to build a world of common prosperity; adhering to exchanges and mutual understanding to build an open and inclusive world; and adhering to green and low-carbon to build a clean and beautiful world. President Xi also encouraged the international community to make joint efforts in terms of partnership, security pattern, economic development, civilizational exchanges and ecological construction, and declared China's firm determination in terms of its unchanging resolve to safeguard world peace, promote common development, forge partnerships and support multilateralism. The 19th CPC National Congress pointed out that ""great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics should promote the construction of a new type of international relations and the building of a community of human destiny"" and included the promotion of the building of a community of human destiny in the basic strategy of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, as well as writing it into the Party's Constitution. On the basis of comprehensively and profoundly summarizing the achievements of 10 years of diplomacy in the new era and systematically analyzing and accurately judging the current international situation, the Twentieth National Congress of the CPC listed ""promoting the building of a community of shared destiny for mankind"" as one of the essential requirements for Chinese-style modernization, and included ""promoting world peace and development, and promoting the building of a community of shared destiny"" as the fourteenth part of its agenda. On the basis of the situation in China, it has listed ""promoting the building of a community of human destiny"" as one of the essential requirements of Chinese modernization, and made ""promoting world peace and development, and promoting the building of a community of human destiny"" the theme of the fourteenth part of the report, clearly stating the principles of China's foreign relations, thus linking the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to the future and destiny of all mankind by means of the link of Chinese modernization and further revealing the significance of the times and the path of practice in promoting the building of a community of human destiny. Contributing Chinese strength to the cause of human progress We are living in an era full of challenges, but also an era full of hope. At present, the world's unprecedented changes are accelerating, and the changes in the world, the times and history are unfolding in an unprecedented manner. The concept of building a community of human destiny, which profoundly elaborates China's propositions and proposals for actively addressing global challenges, points out the direction and draws a blueprint for the human community to realize common development, long-term peace and security, and sustained prosperity, and fully demonstrates China's firm determination and mission to work together with other countries to build a better world. The Way is not alone, and the world is one. In a wide range of areas related to the reform and construction of global governance, President Xi has proposed and promoted the construction of the Belt and Road, the building of a community of destiny in cyberspace, the building of a community of destiny in nuclear security, the building of a community of human health, the building of a community of mankind and nature, the building of a community of destiny in the oceans, the building of a community of life on Earth, the building of a global development community, and the building of a community of human security. Over the past 10 years, the building of a community of human destiny has become a clear banner leading the trend of the times and the direction of mankind. ""The construction of the Belt and Road is an important practical platform for promoting the building of a community of human destiny, and over the past 10 years, the number of countries and international organizations participating in the construction of the Belt and Road has been steadily increasing. The latest statistics show that more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations have signed up. More importantly, the Belt and Road has brought obvious and tangible benefits to the people of the countries along the route, and the countries and international organizations participating in its construction have joined hands to embark on a mutually beneficial and win-win path. The Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative have become important foundations for building a community of human destiny. The Global Development Initiative and the building of a global development community have responded to the strong aspirations of the peoples of all countries for a better life, injected key ideological impetus into the focus on development, unity and common development of all countries, and provided a guide to action for the joint maintenance of the international system with the United Nations at its core, and have triggered a strong reaction in the international community as soon as they were put forward. At present, more than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, support the Global Development Initiative, and nearly 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative. The Global Security Initiative and the building of a human security community have drawn up a blueprint and pointed out a direction for global security governance, demonstrating China's confidence as a great power in realizing its own security and development goals and its commitment to actively fulfilling its international responsibilities and promoting world peace and development, and embodying the core essence of the concept of building a community of shared destiny for humankind. Promoting regional and country-specific cooperation. At the level of global governance, President Xi has, on the occasions of major visits and hosting important main diplomatic events, respectively proposed building a community of destiny in the periphery, building a community of destiny in Asia, building a community of destiny in the Asia-Pacific region, joining hands to build a closer China-ASEAN community of destiny, joining hands to build a closer SCO community of destiny, building a closer China-Africa community of destiny for the new era, and building a closer China-Africa community of destiny for the new era. The SCO is also working to build a closer China-Africa community of destiny in the new era, a China-Arab community of destiny in the new era, a China-Latin America community of destiny, and a closer China-Pacific Island countries community of destiny. At the bilateral level, President Xi has had in-depth communication with the leaders of a series of countries, including Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand and others, to forge consensus and advocate the building of a community of destiny between China and all countries concerned. Promoting the building of a community of destiny in various fields, regions, and even bilaterally at the country level has yielded remarkable results and is of great significance. These efforts, as successful practices under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on diplomacy, have the excellent theoretical quality of observing justice and innovation and the practical character of being people-centered, and are not only practical initiatives to safeguard the overall situation of the strategy for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, but also a scientific response to the major challenges faced by the human society and the countries of the world. These efforts are aimed at encouraging all countries of the world to form a sense of mutual support and solidarity in the corresponding areas and to join hands to overcome risks and challenges, and at encouraging the international community to work together to build our blue planet, where we are born and grow up, into a big, harmonious family, and to turn the aspirations of the people of all countries of the world for a better life into a reality. These efforts are accumulating conditions and energy to promote the building of a community of human destiny and a better world. At the same time, the building of a community of destiny in the field and region is, to a certain extent, a ""key breakthrough"" in the promotion of the building of a community of human destiny, and plays the role of ""point into line, line into surface and surface into body"" in this major historical process. ""The road is long, but the journey will be accomplished; the future is promising if the journey continues unabated."" Promoting the building of a community of human destiny has always been the high melody and spiritual banner of Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought leading China's diplomacy to move forward courageously. In this new era and new journey, we should deeply understand and comprehend the rich theoretical connotation, significant value of the times and far-reaching historical significance of promoting the building of a community of human destiny, insist on comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization, firmly hold up the great banner of building a community of human destiny, insist on vigorously carrying forward the common values of all humanity, take the initiative to act in various fields of global governance, actively promote the building of a community of human destiny, and join hands with people from all over the world to build a community of human destiny. community of human destiny, and work hand in hand with the people of the world to create a better future.

加强干部斗争精神和斗争本领养成 来源： 中国军网-解放军报 作者：刘文煜 王胜男 燕 武 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-03 07:17:18 0,加强干部斗争精神和斗争本领养成 ■火箭军党的创新理论研究中心 习主席在党的二十大报告中明确提出，要“加强干部斗争精神和斗争本领养成”。这一重要指示，既是对我们党斗争经验的继承创新，又是建设堪当民族复兴重任高素质干部队伍的时代要求，充分体现了全面从严治党永远在路上、党的自我革命永远在路上的清醒坚定，明确了加强党的干部队伍建设的重要路径，是深入推进新时代党的建设新的伟大工程的重大现实课题。 一 “政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”作为拥有9600多万名党员的马克思主义政党，我们党肩负的使命任务艰巨繁重，面临的挑战考验复杂严峻，建设一支具备过硬斗争精神和斗争本领的干部队伍，对于高举伟大旗帜、凝聚意志力量、推动事业发展，具有极为重要的意义。 总结党的斗争历史得出的宝贵经验。回望党的奋斗征程，一代代党的优秀干部坚守理想信念，在斗争中创造了一系列伟大成就。革命战争年代，老一辈革命家以武装的革命反对武装的反革命，以大无畏的英雄气概同敌人进行殊死斗争，为争取民族独立、人民解放建立不朽功勋。社会主义革命和建设时期，我们党以顽强的斗争精神，荡涤旧社会留下的污泥浊水，赢得抗美援朝战争伟大胜利，团结带领人民确立社会主义基本制度，推进伟大的社会主义建设。进入改革开放新时期，我们党“摸着石头过河”，号召广大党员干部深入开展各领域体制改革，带领人民成功开辟了中国特色社会主义道路。历史反复证明，一支德才兼备、具备过硬斗争精神和斗争本领的坚强干部队伍，是党和人民的事业不断从胜利走向胜利的重要保证。 履行新时代新征程党的使命任务的素质要求。进入新时代，以习近平同志为核心的党中央，团结带领全党全军全国各族人民进行具有许多新的历史特点的伟大斗争，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革。站在新的历史起点上，党的二十大对全党接续开展新的伟大斗争提出更高要求，强调的“三个务必”之一就是“务必敢于斗争、善于斗争”，要求在前进道路上必须牢牢把握的五个重大原则之一就是“发扬斗争精神”，强调“在重大斗争中磨砺干部，增强干部推动高质量发展本领、服务群众本领、防范化解风险本领”，等等。可见，党对干部队伍斗争精神和斗争本领的要求不仅没有放松，反而更加严格。广大党员干部只有认清形势、迎难而上，以高度的历史主动和政治自觉加强斗争精神和斗争本领的锤炼，才能为战胜前进道路上的各种困难挑战做好充分的思想与能力准备。 巩固发展党的先进性和纯洁性的重要保证。先进的马克思主义政党是在斗争中淬炼而成的。新时代以来，习主席带领全党发扬斗争精神，持之以恒纠治“四风”，开展史无前例的反腐败斗争，彻底扭转了管党治党宽松软的状况，消除了党、国家、军队内部存在的严重隐患。全党更加深刻地认识到，只要敢于直面问题，勇于同党内一切错误思想和行为作斗争，就一定能确保党不变质、不变色、不变味。党的二十大通过的《中国共产党章程（修正案）》将“发扬斗争精神、增强斗争本领”的内容写入其中，成为全体党员干部必须认真践行的基本要求，这也必将为永葆党的先进性和纯洁性提供强有力的保证。 二 加强干部斗争精神和斗争本领的养成是一项长期而艰巨的任务。党的十八大以来，习主席围绕敢于斗争、善于斗争作了许多重要指示，为党员干部加强斗争精神和斗争本领养成提供了根本遵循与行动指南。 必须坚持斗争的方向、立场和原则。习主席指出：“共产党人的斗争是有方向、有立场、有原则的，大方向就是坚持中国共产党领导和我国社会主义制度不动摇”，并鲜明提出必须坚决斗争的五个方面：凡是危害中国共产党领导和我国社会主义制度的各种风险挑战，凡是危害我国主权、安全、发展利益的各种风险挑战，凡是危害我国核心利益和重大原则的各种风险挑战，凡是危害我国人民根本利益的各种风险挑战，凡是危害我国实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的各种风险挑战，只要来了，我们就必须进行坚决斗争，毫不动摇，毫不退缩，直至取得胜利。这些重要论述，明确了加强干部斗争精神和斗争本领养成的政治站位和根本要求。 必须勇于直面矛盾问题、风险挑战开展斗争。斗争精神、斗争本领不是与生俱来的，党员干部只有在复杂严峻的斗争中经风雨、见世面、壮筋骨，才能真正锻造成为烈火真金。回顾党的历史，老一辈革命家正是在极度艰苦残酷的斗争环境中经受历练，才成长为不畏艰险、百折不挠的钢铁战士。当前，我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，各种“黑天鹅”“灰犀牛”事件随时可能发生。面向未来，我们党面临的重大考验和斗争一点也不会比过去少。党员干部应当把应对风险挑战、解决矛盾问题作为斗争的着力重点，在不断斗争中提高本领、推动发展。 必须注重策略方法，提升斗争艺术。在领导中国革命、建设和改革的进程中，我们党总能依靠正确的策略方法、高超的斗争艺术，不断赢得斗争的胜利。进入新时代，习主席深刻总结党的斗争经验，对提高斗争艺术作出一系列重要论述。比如，在斗争的总体把握上，强调要坚持增强忧患意识和保持战略定力相统一、坚持战略判断和战术决断相统一、坚持斗争过程和斗争实效相统一；在斗争策略方法的运用上，强调要抓主要矛盾、抓矛盾的主要方面，坚持有理有利有节，合理选择斗争方式、把握斗争火候；在干部斗争能力的培塑上，强调要善斗争、会斗争，提升见微知著的能力；等等。这些重要论述，是党对斗争策略、斗争艺术的科学总结，标志着党对斗争规律的认识把握达到了新的高度，是党员干部应当在斗争中认真学习掌握和运用的科学方法论。 必须在斗争中锤炼敢于负责、勇于担当的品格作风。面对矛盾和斗争是否敢于负责、勇于担当，最能检验一名干部的党性和作风。习主席要求广大党员干部面对大是大非敢于亮剑，面对矛盾敢于迎难而上，面对危机敢于挺身而出，面对失误敢于承担责任，面对歪风邪气敢于坚决斗争；强调广大党员干部要以钉钉子精神抓工作落实，坚决摒弃一切明哲保身、得过且过、敷衍塞责、懒政怠政等消极行为；特别要求党员领导干部不论在哪个岗位、担任什么职务，都要勇于担当、攻坚克难，既当指挥员、又当战斗员。这些重要指示为党员干部加强党性修养、强化责任担当、发扬斗争精神指明了努力方向。 三 当前，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，世界进入新的动荡变革期。前进道路上，我们要准备经受风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验。广大党员干部必须坚决响应党中央、习主席的号召，发扬斗争精神、提高斗争本领，坚决战胜前进道路上的各种困难和挑战，依靠顽强斗争打开事业发展新天地。 加强思想淬炼，夯实斗争的思想根基。理论上清醒，政治上才能坚定，斗争起来才有底气、才有力量。我们必须坚持用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想武装头脑，坚持好、运用好贯穿其中的立场观点方法，使之成为开展斗争的锐利思想武器。当前，尤其要把坚持党的领导作为衡量思想政治上是否清醒坚定、斗争精神和斗争本领强不强的重要标志，教育引导党员干部深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，贯彻军委主席负责制，始终把握斗争的正确方向，做到头脑特别清醒、立场特别坚定。 加强政治历练，磨砺斗争的坚定意志。政治性是斗争的鲜明特征。党员干部应始终保持斗争必胜的信念，坚定政治信仰、站稳政治立场，坚信在党中央、习主席的坚强领导下，无论面对什么样的艰难险阻，都必将赢得伟大斗争的伟大胜利。始终保持勇于斗争的血性，不断强化勇于斗争的政治自觉，不信邪、不怕鬼、不怕压，旗帜鲜明地捍卫原则立场，以前所未有的意志品质维护国家主权、安全、发展利益。始终保持顽强斗争的韧劲，不断提高政治敏锐性和政治鉴别力，增强越是艰险越向前的斗争锐气与韧劲，努力创造经得起实践、人民和历史检验的实绩。 加强实践锻炼，提升斗争的实际本领。实践是提升斗争本领的基本途径。党员干部应善于在实践中积累斗争经验，积极投身全面深化改革、维护发展稳定大局、推进全面从严治党等实际工作，边学习、边斗争、边进步，努力成为既敢于斗争、又善于斗争的勇士。善于在实践中掌握斗争规律，坚持理论与实践相结合，准确识变、科学应变、主动求变，牢牢掌握斗争的主动权。善于在实践中提升斗争艺术，准确分析斗争形势，正确制定斗争策略，妥善处理好原则坚定性与策略灵活性、斗争目标与斗争方式、斗争过程与斗争效果等关系，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，确保赢得斗争的最终胜利。 （执笔：刘文煜、王胜男、燕 武）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230403235315/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214135.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230403143347/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214135.html,2023-04-04 0:00:00,Strengthening cadres' spirit and ability to fight Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Liu Wenyu Wang Shengnan Yan Wu Editor-in-Chief: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-03 07:17:18 0,"Strengthening cadres' spirit of struggle and ability to fight ■ Rocket Force Party Innovation Theory Research Center President Xi clearly proposed in the report of the 20th Party Congress to ""strengthen cadres' spirit of struggle and ability to fight"". This important instruction is not only the inheritance and innovation of our party's struggle experience, but also the requirement of the times to build a high-quality cadre capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of national rejuvenation, fully embodies the sober firmness that comprehensively governing the party strictly is always on the way, and the party's self-revolution is always on the way, and clarifies an important path to strengthen the construction of the party's cadre, which is the major practical issue of further promoting the new era of party construction of the new great project. I ""After the political line is determined, cadres are the deciding factor."" As a Marxist political party with more than 96 million members, our party shoulders arduous missions and tasks, and faces complex and severe challenges and tests, building a cadre with a strong spirit of struggle and struggle skills is of great significance for holding up the great banner, cohesion of will and strength, and promoting the development of the cause. Summarizing the history of the Party's struggle is a valuable experience. Looking back at the Party's struggle, generations of the Party's outstanding cadres have stood firm on their ideals and beliefs and created a series of great achievements in the struggle. During the revolutionary war era, the revolutionaries of the older generation opposed armed counter-revolution with armed revolution, fought the enemy to the death with fearless heroism, and established immortal feats for the struggle for national independence and people's liberation. During the period of socialist revolution and construction, the Party, in the spirit of tenacious struggle, cleansed the muddy water left behind by the old society, won the great victory in the war against the United States and North Korea, united and led the people to establish the basic socialist system, and pushed forward the great socialist construction. Entering the new period of reform and opening up, the Party ""crossed the river by groping for stones"", called on the majority of Party members and cadres to carry out in-depth institutional reforms in various fields, and led the people to successfully open up the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. History has repeatedly proved that a strong cadre of both moral and intellectual ability, with excellent fighting spirit and fighting skills, is an important guarantee that the cause of the Party and the people will continue to go from victory to victory. Fulfill the quality requirements of the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and new journey. Entering the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, united and led the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation to carry out the great struggle with many new historical characteristics, the Party and the country's cause has made historic achievements and historic changes. Standing on a new historical starting point, the 20th Party Congress put forward higher requirements for the Party to continue to carry out new great struggles, emphasizing that one of the ""three musts"" is ""must dare to struggle, good at struggle"", and requesting that the five major principles must be firmly grasped on the way forward. One of the five major principles that must be firmly grasped on the way forward is to ""carry forward the spirit of struggle"", emphasizing that ""cadres should be sharpened in major struggles, and their ability to promote high-quality development, serve the masses, and prevent and mitigate risks should be strengthened"", and so on. Visible, the party on the cadres of the spirit of struggle and struggle skills requirements not only did not relax, but more stringent. The Party members and cadres can only recognize the situation, rise to the challenge, and strengthen the spirit of struggle and the ability to fight with a high degree of historical initiative and political consciousness, in order to overcome the various difficulties and challenges on the road ahead to make full preparation for the ideology and ability. It is an important guarantee for the consolidation and development of the Party's advancement and purity. Advanced Marxist political parties are refined in struggle. Since the beginning of the new era, President Xi has led the Party in carrying forward the spirit of struggle, persistently correcting the ""four winds"" and launching an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign, completely reversing the laxity of the Party's governance and eliminating the serious hidden dangers that existed within the Party, the State and the military. The Party has come to realize more profoundly that as long as it dares to face up to the problems and fights courageously against all erroneous thoughts and behaviors within the Party, it will be able to ensure that the Party will not deteriorate in quality, color or taste. The 20th Party Congress adopted the ""Constitution of the Communist Party of China (Amendment)"" will ""carry forward the spirit of struggle, strengthen the ability to fight"" written into the content, become all party members and cadres must be seriously practiced the basic requirements, which will also be to maintain the party's advancement and purity to provide a strong guarantee. Strengthening the cadres' spirit of struggle and ability to fight is a long-term and arduous task. Since the 18th National Congress of the Party, President Xi has made many important instructions around the courage to struggle, good at struggle, for the party cadres to strengthen the spirit of struggle and struggle to develop the skills to provide a fundamental guide and action. We must adhere to the direction, position and principles of the struggle. President Xi pointed out that ""the struggle of the communists has a direction, position and principles, and the general direction is to adhere to the leadership of the CPC and China's socialist system without wavering"", and distinctly put forward five aspects that must be resolutely fought against: all risks and challenges that jeopardize the leadership of the CPC and China's socialist system, and all challenges that jeopardize the sovereignty, security and development interests of China. We must resolutely fight against all risks and challenges that jeopardize the leadership of the CPC and the socialist system of China, all risks and challenges that jeopardize the sovereignty, security and development interests of China, all risks and challenges that jeopardize the core interests and major principles of China, all risks and challenges that jeopardize the fundamental interests of the people of China, and all risks and challenges that jeopardize the realization of our goal of the ""Two Hundred Years"" and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We must fight resolutely, without wavering or flinching, until victory is achieved. These important discussions have made clear the political position and fundamental requirements for strengthening the spirit and skills of cadres in the struggle. We must have the courage to face up to contradictions and problems, risks and challenges to carry out the struggle. Struggle spirit, struggle skills are not innate, party cadres only in the complex and severe struggle through the storm, see the world, strong bones, can really forge into a blaze of real gold. Looking back at the history of the party, the older generation of revolutionaries is in the extremely difficult and cruel environment of the struggle through experience, only to grow into a fearless, indomitable steel warrior. At present, China's development into the strategic opportunities and risks and challenges coexist, uncertainty and unpredictable factors increase in the period, a variety of ""black swan"" ""gray rhinoceros"" events may occur at any time. Facing the future, the Party will not face fewer major tests and struggles than in the past. Party members and cadres should focus on addressing risks and challenges, resolving contradictions and problems as the focus of the struggle, and improve their skills and promote development in the continuous struggle. It is necessary to focus on strategy and method to improve the art of struggle. In the process of leading China's revolution, construction and reform, the Party has always been able to rely on correct tactical methods and superb art of struggle to win the struggle. Entering the new era, President Xi has profoundly summarized the Party's experience in struggle and made a series of important remarks on improving the art of struggle. For example, in the overall grasp of the struggle, it is emphasized that we should adhere to the unity of enhancing the awareness of danger and maintaining strategic determination, the unity of strategic judgment and tactical decision, and the unity of the struggle process and the effectiveness of the struggle; in the use of struggle tactics and methods, it is emphasized that we should grasp the main contradiction and the main aspects of the contradiction, adhere to the rationality and advantage, reasonably choose the way of the struggle, and grasp the fire of the struggle; in the cultivation and shaping of the cadre's ability to struggle, it is emphasized that we should be good at struggle, and be able to fight. In the cultivation of cadres' ability to fight, it is emphasized that they should be good at fighting, be able to fight, and enhance their ability to see the small things and know the big things; and so on. These important theses are the Party's scientific summary of the struggle strategy, the art of struggle, marking the Party's understanding of the laws of struggle has reached a new height, is the Party members and cadres should be in the struggle to seriously learn to master and apply the scientific methodology. It is necessary to refine the character and style of being responsible and courageous in the struggle. In the face of contradictions and struggles whether dare to be responsible, the courage to take responsibility, the most test of a cadre's party character and style. President Xi asked the majority of party members and cadres in the face of the major right and wrong dare to sword, in the face of contradictions dare to rise to the challenge, in the face of crisis dare to stand up, in the face of mistakes dare to take responsibility, in the face of crookedness dare to resolutely fight; emphasized that the majority of party members and cadres should be the spirit of the implementation of the spirit of the work of the nail, and resolutely abandon all the philosophical and philosophical, overdoing it, perfunctory, lazy and neglectful of the negative behavior of the government; in particular, party members and cadres are asked to lead Regardless of which position, what position, we must be courageous, overcome difficulties, both as a commander, but also as a combatant. These important instructions for party members and cadres to strengthen the party spirit, strengthen the responsibility to bear, carry forward the spirit of struggle pointed out the direction of efforts. Three Currently, the world's century-old changes accelerate the evolution of the world into a new period of turbulence and change. On the way forward, we have to be prepared to withstand high winds and waves and even shocking waves of the major test. The majority of Party members and cadres must resolutely respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi, carry forward the spirit of struggle, improve the ability to struggle, resolutely overcome all kinds of difficulties and challenges on the road ahead, and rely on the tenacious struggle to open up new horizons for career development. Strengthen the ideological quenching, consolidate the ideological foundation of the struggle. Theoretically sober, politically firm, struggle to have the courage and strength. We must insist on arming our minds with Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, and adhere to and utilize the position and viewpoints and methods that run through it, so as to make it a sharp ideological weapon to carry out the struggle. At present, especially to adhere to the leadership of the party as a measure of ideological and political sobriety and firmness, the spirit of the struggle and the struggle of strong skills, education and guidance of party members and cadres to deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", to enhance the ""four consciousness"", The two establishments will help the Party members and cadres to realize the significance of the two establishments, enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", strengthen the ""four self-confidence"", and achieve the ""two safeguards"", carry out the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and grasp the correct direction of the struggle at all times, so as to make their minds particularly clear and their positions particularly firm. Strengthen political training, sharpen the firm will to struggle. Politics is a distinctive feature of the struggle. Party members and cadres should always maintain the belief that the struggle will be won, firm political beliefs, stand firm political position, firmly believe in the CPC Central Committee, under the strong leadership of President Xi, no matter what kind of difficulties and obstacles, will win a great victory in the great struggle. Always maintain the bloodiness of the courageous struggle, constantly strengthen the political consciousness of the courageous struggle, do not believe in evil, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of pressure, and clearly defend the principled position, with unprecedented quality of will to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests. Always maintain the tenacity of tenacious struggle, constantly improve political sensitivity and political discernment, enhance the more difficult and dangerous the more forward the struggle and tenacity, and strive to create practical achievements that can stand the test of practice, the people and history. Strengthen the practice of exercise, enhance the practical skills of the struggle. Practice is the basic way to improve the ability to fight. Party members and cadres should be good at accumulating experience in the struggle in practice, and actively participate in the comprehensive deepening of reform, safeguarding the overall situation of development and stability, and promoting the overall strict governance of the Party and other practical work, learning, struggling and making progress, and strive to become not only bold, but also good at the struggle of the warrior.

In the new era, our Party has become stronger and more powerful in the revolutionary forging, and a very important experience is that we have always attached importance to the ideological construction of the Party and the theoretical strengthening of the Party, and insisted on arming the minds of the majority of Party members and cadres with scientific theories. On the new journey of the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation, the test of governance, the test of reform and opening up, the test of the market economy, and the test of the external environment faced by the Party will exist for a long time; the danger of mental slackness, the danger of insufficient capacity, the danger of detachment from the masses, and the danger of passive corruption will exist for a long time; the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party will always be on the way, and the Party's self-revolution will always be on the way. Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era inherits and develops the Marxist doctrine of party building, summarizes and applies the historical experience of the party's century-long struggle, and pushes forward the innovation of the practice, theory and system of governing the party, reaching a new height of regularity and understanding of what kind of long-term ruling Marxist political party is being built and how to build a long-term ruling Marxist political party. On the new journey, only by persistently using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era to strengthen the heart and soul can we ensure that the Party will always be at the forefront of the times in the historical process of profound changes in the world situation, always be the backbone of the nation's people in dealing with all kinds of risks and tests both at home and abroad, and always be a strong leading core in the historical process of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. It will be transformed into a powerful force that strengthens ideals, refines party character, and guides practice and promotes work Knowledge is the beginning of action, and action is the fulfillment of knowledge. Chinese communists never study theories for window dressing, but to transform the subjective and objective worlds. The fundamental task of carrying out in-depth education on the theme of studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the whole Party is to insist on the coherence of learning, thinking and application, and the unity of knowledge, belief and action, and to transform Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force that strengthens the ideals, refines the Party's character, and guides practice and promotes work, so that the Party can always maintain a unified ideology, a firm will, a coordinated action, and a strong fighting force, and strive to Achieve tangible results in forging the soul by learning, increasing wisdom by learning, correcting the wind by learning, and promoting work by learning. Transform Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force for firm ideals, and consciously be a firm believer in and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics. ""If the will is not established, nothing can be accomplished in the world."" General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""firm ideals and beliefs will always be an inexhaustible source of strength to inspire us to move forward and overcome difficulties."" Without firm ideals and beliefs, it would have been impossible for the Chinese Communist Party to withstand so many life and death tests, overcome so many difficulties and obstacles, unite and lead the Chinese people from being bullied to self-confidence and self-reliance, push the Chinese nation from decay and withering to thriving, and make Chinese civilization go from being difficult to continue to thriving. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has always raised the banner of ideals and beliefs, profoundly manifesting faith in Marxism, belief in socialism and communism, and profoundly manifesting the lofty pursuits and far-reaching ambitions of Chinese communists in the new era. To transform Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force for firm ideals, we must transform the results of our learning into unshakeable ideals and beliefs, into a correct outlook on the world, life, and values, into a sober cognition and persistent pursuit of lofty ideals and goals, and consciously be a firm believer in, and a faithful practitioner of, the lofty ideals of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We will forge ahead towards our goals with perseverance and perseverance through thick and thin, and create the performance and glory belonging to our generation. Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era has been transformed into a powerful force for refining the Party's character, deeply comprehending the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"" and resolutely achieving the ""two safeguards"". What determines a person's character is behavior, and what determines a party member's character is party spirit. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""party character is the cornerstone of party members, cadres, body, career, speech and morality."" The strong party character of Chinese communists is firstly reflected in remembering that their first identity is a member of the Communist Party, and their first duty is to work for the Party, and that they are always of one mind and one heart with the Party at all times, and that they are loyal to the Party, share the Party's worries, bear the Party's responsibility, and do their duty for the Party. To transform Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force for refining the Party's character, it is necessary to closely link the Party's century-long struggle, the historic achievements and changes of the Party and the country's cause in the new era, and the extremely unusual and extraordinary course we have taken over the years, and to deeply grasp the theoretical and historical logic of the ""two establishments"" and the ""two principles"" of the Party and the country. The Party should deeply grasp the theoretical, historical and practical logic of the ""two establishments"", and profoundly comprehend that the ""two establishments"" is a major political achievement of the Party in the new era, a decisive factor in promoting the Party and the country's cause to make historic achievements and changes, and the greatest certainty, strength and confidence in overcoming all difficulties and obstacles and coping with all uncertainties. It is the greatest certainty, the greatest confidence and the greatest guarantee that we will always maintain a high degree of consistency with the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core of our ideology, politics and actions. We should firmly support the ""two establishments"" and resolutely achieve the ""two maintenance"" as the highest political principle and fundamental political responsibility, and implement it in the actual work and reflect it in our words and deeds, and always be loyal to the core, embrace the core, safeguard the core, and defend the core. Turn Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era into a powerful force to guide practice, and use the developing theory to guide the developing practice. The power of theory can only be realized by putting it into practice; the results of learning should be tested by the effectiveness of practice. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""the viewpoint of practice and the viewpoint of life are the basic viewpoints of Marxist epistemology, and practicability is the distinguishing feature of Marxist theory from other theories."" Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a theory of practice, which is rooted in the soil of reality and responds to the needs of practice, answering in depth a series of major topics of the times relating to the development of the Party and the country and the Party's governance from the perspective of the combination of theory and practice, and guiding our practical actions to comprehensively build a socialist modernized country and realize the second hundred-year struggle goal. To transform Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force guiding practice, we must grasp the worldview and methodology of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, adhere to and utilize the standpoints and methods that run through it, adhere to the combination of theory and practice, take the study of the solution of hotspots and difficult problems in practice as the focus, adhere to the unity of knowledge and practice, and really do something, and be an actor, not a sitter. We should be a man of action, not a talker who sits and discusses, a struggler who tackles difficulties, not a clay Bodhisattva who is afraid of seeing the wind and rain, and we should fully demonstrate the distinctive practical character of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era with the positive results of transforming the world. Transform Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era into a powerful force to promote the work, and strive to put the major decisions and deployments made by the 20th Party Congress into action and see results. True knowledge is so to do, not enough to be called knowledge. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""the most important task at present is to roll up the sleeves and do a good job, and step by step to put the major decisions and deployments made at the 20th Party Congress into action and see the results."" In his report to the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping broke a grand blueprint for building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization, and made a comprehensive plan for coordinating the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the ""Four Comprehensive"" strategic layout. It makes a comprehensive deployment of the ""five-in-one"" overall layout and the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout, and focuses on the strategic tasks and major initiatives for the next five years. To accomplish any of these strategic tasks and major initiatives is not easy, and there are no shortcuts, only practical work. Xi Jinping Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into a powerful force to promote the work, we must adhere to the learning and applying, physically, in the study of their own in, put their duties in, put their work in, the results of the study into the work of their own work, to promote the cause of development. For the work of the problems encountered in the work, we need to explore investigation and research, really find out the situation, find the right problem, the countermeasures to mention the real, and constantly put forward new ideas to solve the real problem of the new way. To know the unity of action to take on the role, the courage to take on the heavy burden, the spirit of slackness, get by, say no, not dare to fight, take refuge and escape responsibility say no, with the knowledge of the heavy burden, overcome the difficulties of the actual action to break through the passes and overcome the strongholds, the implementation of the Party's twentieth major decisions made and deployments, to create a practice, the people, history test of the actual results.","The article discusses the importance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as a guiding principle for the Communist Party of China (CPC) in leading the country towards modernization and national rejuvenation.

观点争鸣丨作战决策应融入复杂性思维 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：徐玉忠 张 壹 杨 宁 责任编辑：王韵 2023-04-06 07:12:42 0,作战决策应融入复杂性思维 ■徐玉忠 张 壹 杨 宁 作战决策是对作战中全局性重大问题或关键性问题作出的决断，是一个关乎作战胜利与否的重要而复杂的问题，更是凝聚指挥员对敌情、我情和战场环境等多因素思维的结果。现代战争是在陆、海、空、天、网、电等多维空间同时展开的复杂性对抗，作战决策已经不可能像“眉头一皱、计上心来”那么简单，而是由“智”而“谋”的一种创造性思维活动。这就要求指挥员应充分认清现代战争系统的复杂性，准确把握现代战争指挥的思维规律，积极融入复杂性思维方式，使作战决策更加科学合理，指挥控制更加灵活高效。 融入更理性的过程思维 所谓过程思维，是与静态思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的过程思维，是指挥员为获得预期结果而快速分析出多种可行性方案，进而再研判出最佳方案的思维状态。其关键是对战场态势进行全方位、多层次的分析研判。随着战争形态的加速演进，作战空间、兵力构成以及武器装备等作战要素正在发生深刻变化，致使现代作战体系所呈现出的战场复杂性骤然提升。这就要求指挥员应强化过程思维，充分计算敌我双方作战效能、体系重心和关键节点，反复推演分析敌之可能行动和我应对策略。正如毛泽东同志所强调的：“在研究部署时，除根据当前情况外，还要估计到情况的某些可能发生的变化。要设想敌可能变化的几种情况，其中应包括一种较严重的情况，要准备在这种情况下有对付的办法。” 战争的复杂性，就在于其过程具有激烈的对抗性、超强的时效性和高度的风险性。近年来的局部战争实践表明，“技术差”是导致弱势一方难有还手之力的直接原因，但透过“技术差”，在“技”不如人的背后，更深层地折射出的是“思”不如人。正如克劳塞维茨所说，任何思维都是一种能力。因此，简单的静态思维模式已经无法满足未来作战的决策需求，指挥员应学会运用过程思维综合考量战场可能出现的各种复杂变化，理性并高效地处理战场态势，确保作战决策的合理性和时效性。 融入更全面的联系思维 所谓联系思维，是与片面思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的联系思维，是指挥员在面对变化的战场环境和复杂的战场态势时，对战场客观条件、基本处置方法等方面进行的关联性审视。“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”毛泽东同志的这一重要论述，深刻阐明了联系思维的精髓要义，既将侦察、判断、决心到行动等一系列思维活动与实际情况紧密地联系起来，又将各个方面的思维活动联结成为一个整体。 未来战争中，战场环境复杂化、情报信息多源化和对抗活动多域化，决定了指挥员的片面思维不仅无法把握战场全貌，更无法把握敌方的作战行动和真实意图。未来复杂多域战场上出现的任何一个单元都将不再是孤立的实体，而是由实体与周围战场环境要素共同组成的一种复杂体系。因此，适应未来战争特点的作战决策，应该运用更为全面的联系思维，将战场态势看作一个由多种作战要素及其复杂关系构成的整体，善于透过纷乱无序的战场表象抓住其背后的联系和实质，统筹各部门职能和各战场要素，处理好局部与全局的关系，使作战决策更加科学合理且富有成效。 融入更有效的适应思维 所谓适应思维，是与线性机械思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的适应思维，是指挥员着眼现代战争特点规律，采用灵活的非线性思维，使作战决策不断适应战场的动态变化。“兵无常势，水无常形”，基于军情复杂和“兵无常势”的客观条件，孙武提出了“兵因敌而制胜”。克劳塞维茨也认为，战争并不是活的力量对死的物质的行动，它总是两股活的力量之间的冲突。因此，历史上从未出现过两场完全相同的战争，事实上，即使给定相同的初始条件，战争亦不会沿着同样的轨迹发展。 从一定意义上讲，作战决策的思维水平决定着指挥员的指挥水平，它既是应对战场复杂性态势的必然要求，又是发挥战争主体能动性的集中反映。未来战争中，随着无人系统、机器人、自主武器等新一代高技术装备广泛运用于战场，无论是作战空间的多维性、作战方式的多样性，还是作战信息的多变性、作战行动的不可控性等，都不可避免地对指挥员作战决策思维产生冲击。因此，作战决策只有主动适应未来战场变化，摒弃按套路、走流程的线性思维，重视无序、个性和非线式等因素在作战决策中的作用，才能在未来战场上赢得主动。 融入更管用的有机思维 所谓有机思维，是与还原主义思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的有机思维，是指挥员依据作战意图以及敌情、我情和战场环境等情况，对物理域信息域认知域一体作战进行的整体性运筹谋划。在作战决策重心上，聚焦认知域双方对抗，关注物理域信息域行动对人的影响、人对物理域信息域行动的影响，以最终达成瘫敌物质基础、毁敌精神意志的战略目标。辩证唯物主义认为，客观世界是极为复杂的有机联系的统一整体，正确认知是认识和改造客观世界的基本前提。从军事领域来看，正确的思维认知已经成为人们认识战争、赢得战争的强大思想武器，从根本上制约着军心士气、影响着决策质量。 战争实践告诉我们，战争对抗归根结底是指挥员思维认知的博弈，思维认知正确才能掌握战场的主动权，思维认知错误就会丧失战场的主动权。钱学森曾说过，凡是不能用还原论方法处理的，或不宜用还原论方法处理的问题，而要用或宜用新的科学方法处理的，都是复杂性问题。要有效解决战场上的复杂性问题，就要求指挥员提高有机思维能力，在正确理解上级意图和科学判断形势的基础上，因时因势发挥主观能动性，制定出思维认知正确的作战决策。因此，必须在作战决策中合理运用有机思维，特别是在目标选择上，将人的性格、心理、情感等认知因素考虑在内，将认知作为确定作战目标的重要因素，集中使用精锐力量打击，才能有效重创敌作战体系，对敌形成强大震慑，最终达成“不战而屈人之兵”的作战目的。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230407000547/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214773.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230406114719/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214773.html,2023-04-07 0:00:00,Viewpoint Controversy丨Operational decision-making should be integrated into complexity thinking Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Xu Yuzong Zhang Yi Yang Ning Editor-in-Chief: Wang Yun 2023-04-06 07:12:42 0,"Operational decision-making should be integrated into the complexity of thinking ■ Xu Yuzhong Zhang Yi Yang Ning Operational decision-making is the operation of the overall situation of the major issues or key issues to make a decision, is an important and complex issues related to operational victory or not, but also the cohesion of the commander of the enemy, my situation and the battlefield environment, and other factors such as the results of thinking. Modern war is on land, sea, air, sky, network, electricity and other multi-dimensional space at the same time the complexity of the confrontation, operational decision-making is no longer possible as ""a frown, the plan on the heart"" so simple, but by the ""wisdom"" and ""plan! ""It is a creative thinking activity. This requires that the commander should fully recognize the complexity of the modern war system, accurately grasp the law of thinking of modern war command, and actively integrate the complexity of the way of thinking, so that combat decision-making is more scientific and rational, command and control is more flexible and efficient. Incorporate a more rational process thinking The so-called process thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to static thinking. The process thinking in combat decision-making is the thinking state of the commander who quickly analyzes a variety of feasible options to obtain the expected results and then studies and judges the best options. The key is to analyze and judge the battlefield situation in an all-round and multi-level way. With the accelerated evolution of the war pattern, the combat space, force composition and weapons and equipment and other combat elements are undergoing profound changes, resulting in the modern combat system presented by the complexity of the battlefield suddenly increased. This requires commanders to strengthen process thinking, fully calculate the combat effectiveness of the enemy and us, the center of gravity of the system and key nodes, and repeatedly deduce and analyze the enemy's possible actions and my response strategy. As Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized, ""When studying deployment, in addition to the current situation, it is necessary to estimate certain possible changes in the situation. Several scenarios of possible changes in the enemy should be envisaged, which should include a more serious situation, and ways of dealing with this situation should be prepared."" The complexity of war lies in the fact that its process is intensely confrontational, exceedingly time-sensitive and highly risky. Local war practice in recent years has shown that ""poor technology"" is the direct cause of the weaker party is difficult to fight back, but through the ""poor technology"", in the ""technology"" is not as good as others, the deeper reflection of the But through the ""poor technique"", behind the ""technical"" inferiority, the deeper refraction is the ""thinking"" inferiority. As Clausewitz said, any thinking is an ability. Therefore, the simple static thinking mode can no longer meet the decision-making needs of future operations, and commanders should learn to use process thinking to comprehensively consider all kinds of complex changes that may occur on the battlefield, rationally and efficiently deal with the battlefield situation, and ensure that the rationality and timeliness of combat decision-making. Incorporate more comprehensive linkage thinking The so-called linkage thinking is a complex thinking as opposed to one-sided thinking. The linkage thinking in combat decision-making is the commander's correlative scrutiny of the objective conditions of the battlefield, basic disposal methods and other aspects in the face of changing battlefield environments and complex battlefield postures. ""A commander's correct deployment comes from correct determination, correct determination from correct judgment, and correct judgment from thoughtful and necessary reconnaissance and coherent thinking about all kinds of reconnaissance material."" This important exposition of Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly clarifies the essence of linked thinking, which closely links a series of thinking activities from reconnaissance, judgment, determination to action with the actual situation, and links all aspects of thinking activities into a whole. In the future war, the complexity of the battlefield environment, the multi-source intelligence information and the multi-domain confrontation activities determine that the commander's one-sided thinking not only fails to grasp the whole picture of the battlefield, but also fails to grasp the enemy's combat actions and real intentions. Any unit on the future complex multi-domain battlefield will no longer be an isolated entity, but a complex system composed of entities and elements of the surrounding battlefield environment. Therefore, to adapt to the characteristics of the future war combat decision-making, we should use a more comprehensive linkage thinking, the battlefield situation as a whole composed of a variety of combat elements and their complex relationships, good through the chaos of the battlefield appearance to seize the connection and substance behind it, the integration of the functions of various departments and the battlefield elements, and to deal with the relationship between the local and the overall situation, so as to make combat decision-making more scientific, rational and fruitful. The so-called adaptive thinking is the complexity of thinking as opposed to linear mechanical thinking. The so-called adaptive thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to linear mechanical thinking. Adaptive thinking in operational decision-making is the commander's focus on the characteristics of modern warfare law, the use of flexible non-linear thinking, so that operational decision-making to adapt to the dynamic changes in the battlefield. ""Soldiers are unpredictable, water is unpredictable"", based on the complexity of the military situation and ""soldiers are unpredictable"" objective conditions, sun wu put forward the ""soldiers because of the enemy and win"". Clausewitz also believes that war is not an action of living force against dead matter, it is always a conflict between two living forces. Therefore, there have never been two identical wars in history; in fact, even given the same initial conditions, wars do not follow the same trajectory. In a certain sense, the level of thinking in combat decision-making determines the level of command of the commander, which is not only an inevitable requirement to deal with the complexity of the battlefield situation, but also a centralized reflection of the initiative of the main body of the war. In the future war, with the unmanned systems, robots, autonomous weapons and other new generation of high-tech equipment widely used in the battlefield, whether it is the multi-dimensionality of the combat space, the diversity of combat modes, or the versatility of the combat information, the uncontrollability of combat operations, etc., are inevitably on the commanders combat decision-making thinking impact. Therefore, combat decision-making only actively adapt to the future battlefield changes, abandon the linear thinking according to the routines and processes, and pay attention to the role of disorder, personality and non-linear factors in combat decision-making in order to win the initiative on the future battlefield. Incorporate more useful organic thinking The so-called organic thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to reductionist thinking. Organic thinking in operational decision-making is based on the commander's operational intent and the enemy's situation, my situation and the battlefield environment, the physical domain information domain cognitive domain integrated combat overall operational planning. In the center of gravity of combat decision-making, focusing on the confrontation between the two sides in the cognitive domain, paying attention to the impact of physical domain information domain actions on people, the impact of people on physical domain information domain actions, in order to ultimately achieve the strategic goal of paralyzing the enemy's material base and destroying the enemy's spiritual will. Dialectical materialism believes that the objective world is an extremely complex organically linked unified whole, and correct cognition is the basic premise for recognizing and transforming the objective world. From the military field, correct cognition has become a powerful ideological weapon for people to recognize and win the war, fundamentally restricting the morale of the military and affecting the quality of decision-making. War practice tells us that the war confrontation is ultimately a game of cognitive thinking of the commander, thinking cognitively correct in order to grasp the initiative of the battlefield, thinking cognitive error will lose the initiative of the battlefield. Qian Xuesen once said, all can not be dealt with by reductionist methods, or should not be dealt with by reductionist methods to deal with the problem, but to use or appropriate to deal with a new scientific method, are complexity issues. To effectively solve the complexity problem on the battlefield, it is required that the commander improve the organic thinking ability, on the basis of correctly understanding the intention of the superiors and scientific judgment of the situation, to play the subjective initiative according to the time and situation, and to formulate the combat decision of thinking cognitively correct. Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably use organic thinking in combat decision-making, especially in target selection, the human character, psychology, emotions and other cognitive factors into account, cognition as an important factor in determining the combat objectives, and focus on the use of elite forces to combat, in order to effectively re-create the enemy combat system, and form a strong deterrent to the enemy, and ultimately achieve the ""war without giving up the war"" combat objectives. The final result is to achieve the combat objective of ""giving up the enemy without a fight"". (Author's unit: School of Political Science, National Defense University)","The article discusses the importance of incorporating complexity thinking in operational decision-making for modern warfare. This involves using process thinking, linkage thinking, adaptive thinking, and organic thinking to consider various factors and predict possible changes in the battlefield. The complexity of the modern war system requires commanders to think critically and holistically when making decisions, with the understanding that the war is dynamic and unpredictable. The article emphasizes that incorporating these types of thinking can lead to more rational and effective combat decision-making, which is crucial for success in future wars."
认清现代战争系统的复杂性，作战决策融入复杂性思维方式 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：徐玉忠 张壹 杨 宁 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-06 07:46:26 0,作战决策应融入复杂性思维 ■徐玉忠 张 壹 杨 宁 作战决策是对作战中全局性重大问题或关键性问题作出的决断，是一个关乎作战胜利与否的重要而复杂的问题，更是凝聚指挥员对敌情、我情和战场环境等多因素思维的结果。现代战争是在陆、海、空、天、网、电等多维空间同时展开的复杂性对抗，作战决策已经不可能像“眉头一皱、计上心来”那么简单，而是由“智”而“谋”的一种创造性思维活动。这就要求指挥员应充分认清现代战争系统的复杂性，准确把握现代战争指挥的思维规律，积极融入复杂性思维方式，使作战决策更加科学合理，指挥控制更加灵活高效。 融入更理性的过程思维 所谓过程思维，是与静态思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的过程思维，是指挥员为获得预期结果而快速分析出多种可行性方案，进而再研判出最佳方案的思维状态。其关键是对战场态势进行全方位、多层次的分析研判。随着战争形态的加速演进，作战空间、兵力构成以及武器装备等作战要素正在发生深刻变化，致使现代作战体系所呈现出的战场复杂性骤然提升。这就要求指挥员应强化过程思维，充分计算敌我双方作战效能、体系重心和关键节点，反复推演分析敌之可能行动和我应对策略。正如毛泽东同志所强调的：“在研究部署时，除根据当前情况外，还要估计到情况的某些可能发生的变化。要设想敌可能变化的几种情况，其中应包括一种较严重的情况，要准备在这种情况下有对付的办法。” 战争的复杂性，就在于其过程具有激烈的对抗性、超强的时效性和高度的风险性。近年来的局部战争实践表明，“技术差”是导致弱势一方难有还手之力的直接原因，但透过“技术差”，在“技”不如人的背后，更深层地折射出的是“思”不如人。正如克劳塞维茨所说，任何思维都是一种能力。因此，简单的静态思维模式已经无法满足未来作战的决策需求，指挥员应学会运用过程思维综合考量战场可能出现的各种复杂变化，理性并高效地处理战场态势，确保作战决策的合理性和时效性。 融入更全面的联系思维 所谓联系思维，是与片面思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的联系思维，是指挥员在面对变化的战场环境和复杂的战场态势时，对战场客观条件、基本处置方法等方面进行的关联性审视。“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”毛泽东同志的这一重要论述，深刻阐明了联系思维的精髓要义，既将侦察、判断、决心到行动等一系列思维活动与实际情况紧密地联系起来，又将各个方面的思维活动联结成为一个整体。 未来战争中，战场环境复杂化、情报信息多源化和对抗活动多域化，决定了指挥员的片面思维不仅无法把握战场全貌，更无法把握敌方的作战行动和真实意图。未来复杂多域战场上出现的任何一个单元都将不再是孤立的实体，而是由实体与周围战场环境要素共同组成的一种复杂体系。因此，适应未来战争特点的作战决策，应该运用更为全面的联系思维，将战场态势看作一个由多种作战要素及其复杂关系构成的整体，善于透过纷乱无序的战场表象抓住其背后的联系和实质，统筹各部门职能和各战场要素，处理好局部与全局的关系，使作战决策更加科学合理且富有成效。 融入更有效的适应思维 所谓适应思维，是与线性机械思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的适应思维，是指挥员着眼现代战争特点规律，采用灵活的非线性思维，使作战决策不断适应战场的动态变化。“兵无常势，水无常形”，基于军情复杂和“兵无常势”的客观条件，孙武提出了“兵因敌而制胜”。克劳塞维茨也认为，战争并不是活的力量对死的物质的行动，它总是两股活的力量之间的冲突。因此，历史上从未出现过两场完全相同的战争，事实上，即使给定相同的初始条件，战争亦不会沿着同样的轨迹发展。 从一定意义上讲，作战决策的思维水平决定着指挥员的指挥水平，它既是应对战场复杂性态势的必然要求，又是发挥战争主体能动性的集中反映。未来战争中，随着无人系统、机器人、自主武器等新一代高技术装备广泛运用于战场，无论是作战空间的多维性、作战方式的多样性，还是作战信息的多变性、作战行动的不可控性等，都不可避免地对指挥员作战决策思维产生冲击。因此，作战决策只有主动适应未来战场变化，摒弃按套路、走流程的线性思维，重视无序、个性和非线式等因素在作战决策中的作用，才能在未来战场上赢得主动。 融入更管用的有机思维 所谓有机思维，是与还原主义思维相对的复杂性思维。作战决策中的有机思维，是指挥员依据作战意图以及敌情、我情和战场环境等情况，对物理域信息域认知域一体作战进行的整体性运筹谋划。在作战决策重心上，聚焦认知域双方对抗，关注物理域信息域行动对人的影响、人对物理域信息域行动的影响，以最终达成瘫敌物质基础、毁敌精神意志的战略目标。辩证唯物主义认为，客观世界是极为复杂的有机联系的统一整体，正确认知是认识和改造客观世界的基本前提。从军事领域来看，正确的思维认知已经成为人们认识战争、赢得战争的强大思想武器，从根本上制约着军心士气、影响着决策质量。 战争实践告诉我们，战争对抗归根结底是指挥员思维认知的博弈，思维认知正确才能掌握战场的主动权，思维认知错误就会丧失战场的主动权。钱学森曾说过，凡是不能用还原论方法处理的，或不宜用还原论方法处理的问题，而要用或宜用新的科学方法处理的，都是复杂性问题。要有效解决战场上的复杂性问题，就要求指挥员提高有机思维能力，在正确理解上级意图和科学判断形势的基础上，因时因势发挥主观能动性，制定出思维认知正确的作战决策。因此，必须在作战决策中合理运用有机思维，特别是在目标选择上，将人的性格、心理、情感等认知因素考虑在内，将认知作为确定作战目标的重要因素，集中使用精锐力量打击，才能有效重创敌作战体系，对敌形成强大震慑，最终达成“不战而屈人之兵”的作战目的。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230407000547/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214772.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230411140436/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214772.html,2023-04-07 0:00:00,"Recognize the complexity of the modern war system, combat decision-making into the complexity of the way of thinking Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Xu Yuzhong Zhang Yi Yang Ning Responsibility: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-06 07:46:26 0","Operational decision-making should be integrated into the complexity of thinking ■ Xu Yuzhong Zhang Yi Yang Ning Operational decision-making is the operation of the overall situation of the major issues or key issues to make a decision, is an important and complex issues related to operational victory or not, but also the cohesion of the commander of the enemy, my situation and the battlefield environment, and other factors such as the results of thinking. Modern war is on land, sea, air, sky, network, electricity and other multi-dimensional space at the same time the complexity of the confrontation, operational decision-making is no longer possible as ""a frown, the plan on the heart"" so simple, but by the ""wisdom"" and ""plan! ""It is a creative thinking activity. This requires that the commander should fully recognize the complexity of the modern war system, accurately grasp the law of thinking of modern war command, and actively integrate the complexity of the way of thinking, so that combat decision-making is more scientific and rational, command and control is more flexible and efficient. Incorporate a more rational process thinking The so-called process thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to static thinking. The process thinking in combat decision-making is the thinking state of the commander who quickly analyzes a variety of feasible options to obtain the expected results and then studies and judges the best options. The key is to analyze and judge the battlefield situation in an all-round and multi-level way. With the accelerated evolution of the war pattern, the combat space, force composition and weapons and equipment and other combat elements are undergoing profound changes, resulting in the modern combat system presented by the complexity of the battlefield suddenly increased. This requires commanders to strengthen process thinking, fully calculate the combat effectiveness of the enemy and us, the center of gravity of the system and key nodes, and repeatedly deduce and analyze the enemy's possible actions and my response strategy. As Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized, ""When studying deployment, in addition to the current situation, it is necessary to estimate certain possible changes in the situation. Several scenarios of possible changes in the enemy should be envisaged, which should include a more serious situation, and ways of dealing with this situation should be prepared."" The complexity of war lies in the fact that its process is intensely confrontational, exceedingly time-sensitive and highly risky. Local war practice in recent years has shown that ""poor technology"" is the direct cause of the weaker party is difficult to fight back, but through the ""poor technology"", in the ""technology"" is not as good as others, the deeper reflection of the But through the ""poor technique"", behind the ""technical"" inferiority, the deeper refraction is the ""thinking"" inferiority. As Clausewitz said, any thinking is an ability. Therefore, the simple static thinking mode can no longer meet the decision-making needs of future operations, and commanders should learn to use process thinking to comprehensively consider all kinds of complex changes that may occur on the battlefield, rationally and efficiently deal with the battlefield situation, and ensure that the rationality and timeliness of combat decision-making. Incorporate more comprehensive linkage thinking The so-called linkage thinking is a complex thinking as opposed to one-sided thinking. The linkage thinking in combat decision-making is the commander's correlative scrutiny of the objective conditions of the battlefield, basic disposal methods and other aspects in the face of changing battlefield environments and complex battlefield postures. ""A commander's correct deployment comes from correct determination, correct determination from correct judgment, and correct judgment from thoughtful and necessary reconnaissance and coherent thinking about all kinds of reconnaissance material."" This important exposition of Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly clarifies the essence of linked thinking, which closely links a series of thinking activities from reconnaissance, judgment, determination to action with the actual situation, and links all aspects of thinking activities into a whole. In the future war, the complexity of the battlefield environment, the multi-source intelligence information and the multi-domain confrontation activities determine that the commander's one-sided thinking not only fails to grasp the whole picture of the battlefield, but also fails to grasp the enemy's combat actions and real intentions. Any unit on the future complex multi-domain battlefield will no longer be an isolated entity, but a complex system composed of entities and elements of the surrounding battlefield environment. Therefore, to adapt to the characteristics of the future war combat decision-making, we should use a more comprehensive linkage thinking, the battlefield situation as a whole composed of a variety of combat elements and their complex relationships, good through the chaos of the battlefield appearance to seize the connection and substance behind it, the integration of the functions of various departments and the battlefield elements, and to deal with the relationship between the local and the overall situation, so as to make combat decision-making more scientific, rational and fruitful. The so-called adaptive thinking is the complexity of thinking as opposed to linear mechanical thinking. The so-called adaptive thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to linear mechanical thinking. Adaptive thinking in operational decision-making is the commander's focus on the characteristics of modern warfare law, the use of flexible non-linear thinking, so that operational decision-making to adapt to the dynamic changes in the battlefield. ""Soldiers are unpredictable, water is unpredictable"", based on the complexity of the military situation and ""soldiers are unpredictable"" objective conditions, sun wu put forward the ""soldiers because of the enemy and win"". Clausewitz also believes that war is not an action of living force against dead matter, it is always a conflict between two living forces. Therefore, there have never been two identical wars in history; in fact, even given the same initial conditions, wars do not follow the same trajectory. In a certain sense, the level of thinking in combat decision-making determines the level of command of the commander, which is not only an inevitable requirement to deal with the complexity of the battlefield situation, but also a centralized reflection of the initiative of the main body of the war. In the future war, with the unmanned systems, robots, autonomous weapons and other new generation of high-tech equipment widely used in the battlefield, whether it is the multi-dimensionality of the combat space, the diversity of combat modes, or the versatility of the combat information, the uncontrollability of combat operations, etc., are inevitably on the commanders combat decision-making thinking impact. Therefore, combat decision-making only actively adapt to the future battlefield changes, abandon the linear thinking according to the routines and processes, and pay attention to the role of disorder, personality and non-linear factors in combat decision-making in order to win the initiative on the future battlefield. Incorporate more useful organic thinking The so-called organic thinking is the complexity of thinking relative to reductionist thinking. Organic thinking in operational decision-making is based on the commander's operational intent and the enemy's situation, my situation and the battlefield environment, the physical domain information domain cognitive domain integrated combat overall operational planning. In the center of gravity of combat decision-making, focusing on the confrontation between the two sides in the cognitive domain, paying attention to the impact of physical domain information domain actions on people, the impact of people on physical domain information domain actions, in order to ultimately achieve the strategic goal of paralyzing the enemy's material base and destroying the enemy's spiritual will. Dialectical materialism believes that the objective world is an extremely complex organically linked unified whole, and correct cognition is the basic premise for recognizing and transforming the objective world. From the military field, correct cognition has become a powerful ideological weapon for people to recognize and win the war, fundamentally restricting the morale of the military and affecting the quality of decision-making. War practice tells us that the war confrontation is ultimately a game of cognitive thinking of the commander, thinking cognitively correct in order to grasp the initiative of the battlefield, thinking cognitive error will lose the initiative of the battlefield. Qian Xuesen once said, all can not be dealt with by reductionist methods, or should not be dealt with by reductionist methods to deal with the problem, but to use or appropriate to deal with a new scientific method, are complexity issues. To effectively solve the complexity problem on the battlefield, it is required that the commander improve the organic thinking ability, on the basis of correctly understanding the intention of the superiors and scientific judgment of the situation, to play the subjective initiative according to the time and situation, and to formulate the combat decision of thinking cognitively correct. Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably use organic thinking in combat decision-making, especially in target selection, the human character, psychology, emotions and other cognitive factors into account, cognition as an important factor in determining the combat objectives, and focus on the use of elite forces to combat, in order to effectively re-create the enemy combat system, and form a strong deterrent to the enemy, and ultimately achieve the ""war without giving up the war"" combat objectives. The final result is to achieve the combat objective of ""giving up the enemy without a fight"". (Author's unit: School of Political Science, National Defense University)","The article discusses the importance of incorporating various complex thinking methods into operational decision-making in modern warfare. These methods include process thinking, linkage thinking, adaptive thinking, and organic thinking. It highlights that modern warfare is characterized by its complexity and requires commanders to analyze and judge the battlefield situation in an all-round and multi-level way. Process thinking involves analyzing and judging the possible changes in the battlefield situation to predict and prepare for various scenarios. Linkage thinking involves considering the objective conditions of the battlefield, basic disposal methods, and other aspects in the face of changing battlefield environments and complex battlefield postures. Adaptive thinking involves focusing on the characteristics of modern warfare law and using flexible non-linear thinking to adapt to dynamic changes in the battlefield. Organic thinking involves integrating the physical, information, and cognitive domains and focusing on the confrontation in the cognitive domain to paralyze the enemy's material base and destroy their spiritual will."
未来战争中，域接合部将作为联合全域战场的焦点备受关注 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：袁艺 张玉军 李志飞 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-06 07:42:41 0,●作战价值重大 ●组织指挥复杂 ●新质战力“富矿” 域接合部：未来战争必争之地 ■袁 艺 张玉军 李志飞 核心提示 随着军事科技的迅猛发展和作战空间的日益拓展，现代战争作战域的类型更加丰富多样，各作战域之间的融合程度进一步加深。正如多学科融合碰撞会产生前沿交叉学科一样，各作战域的交叉融合，也会产生具有重要战略地位和重大作战价值的“域接合部”，并由此催生一系列新行动新样式新战法，涌现出新质战斗力。 “接合部”概念起源于陆战场，是指两支部队作战部署相连接的地方。本文所说的“域接合部”，则是指陆、海、空、天、电、网等作战域之间的连接处。例如，陆海相接的濒海地区和近海，空天相接的低轨道和亚轨道，网络域与认知域相接的网络认知域，以及与电磁域相接的网电域等。 以往战争中，陆战场中不同部队之间的接合部，往往是兵力部署的薄弱点，是谋求出其不意撕开对手防线并发动纵深攻击的突破口。未来战争中，对战场综合控制权的争夺可能首先围绕域接合部展开，域接合部将作为整个联合全域战场的焦点而备受关注。 域接合部成为军种作战能力多域拓展的基本指向 通常说来，每个军种都有自身相应的优势作战域，对于这些专属“自留地”，其他军种因职责分工和能力所限往往难以涉足，如陆军的城市与山地战场、海军的远海与深海战场、天军的高轨与深空战场等。从强国军队建设发展实践看，随着跨域作战技术和手段的发展，为谋求在联合作战中发挥更大作用，各军种作战能力的拓展，不约而同地指向了本军种优势作战域边缘与相邻作战域的域接合部。其根本原因，就是域接合部具有重要战略地位和重大作战价值。 域接合部战略地位极其重要。从地缘战略角度看，对于实力相近的对手而言，基于自身地理特点，往往在某一作战域具有比较优势，如有的擅长陆上作战，有的具有海上优势等。冲突初期，都会力避首先进入对方优势域作战，各对手方通常会在各自优势域的边缘地带即域接合部首先发生碰撞和较量。战争实践表明，像陆权大国与海权大国对抗，前者首先要倚陆制海，取得近海优势，再向远海拓展；后者也需要利用海上优势由海向陆，首先取得近海优势，再向大陆纵深拓展。此时，陆域与海域接合部的近海，就成为双方对抗的焦点战场，谁先在域接合部取得优势，谁就能抢先压制对手。 域接合部具有重大作战价值。域接合部是两个及以上作战域能力相互交叠的区域，先天兼具多域特性，既能以一域行动影响多域，又能以多域能力聚焦一域，有效发挥各作战域在作战机理、作战力量、作战时空上的互补优势，从而在有限战场内汇聚多域作战资源，给对手制造复杂性。 在域接合部，针对一个目标可快速闭合多条不同类型的跨域杀伤链，迫使对手在规避某个作战域力量打击的同时，又暴露在另一作战域力量的打击范围内，使其难以应对多域多向威胁，从而陷入多重困境。 域接合部作战是衡量联合作战水平的试金石 未来随着各军种向“一专多能”方向发展，各军种作战能力将在域接合部产生交叠覆盖。在整个联合全域战场，域接合部作战的联合程度将最深、情况最为复杂、组织难度最大，将成为衡量一支军队联合作战水平极具代表性的作战样式。 跨域作战呈常态化。在域接合部，各军种利用自身不断丰富的跨域作战手段，向其他作战域持续施加影响，产生了陆军远程火箭炮反舰、反潜，空军飞机布雷、反舰，海军舰艇反导、反卫，天军在轨对地打击等多种跨域行动，极大丰富了作战手段与打击目标的匹配类型，对同一目标可综合运用多域多类打击手段，生成多种复合打击方案。域接合部作战，跨域行动与单域行动密切配合，为达成作战目的提供更多作战选项，有利于形成更大作战优势，因而将逐步成为常态。 联合作战样式丰富。在整个战场体系中，域接合部作为多个作战域能力的交叉点，具有多域毗邻、连接多域的特性，能够通过跨域协同、多域聚能方式，催生出一系列联合作战新样式。各国军队先后提出来的空地一体战、空海一体战、空天一体战、网电一体战等作战概念，都试图通过聚焦域接合部，释放出两域接合的巨大作战潜能。未来随着跨域作战手段和能力的不断增强，域与域交叉的可能情况将由两域结合向多域组合、全域联合方向发展，从而产生更为丰富的作战样式。 联合作战组织复杂。在域接合部作战，参战力量类型多样，兵力兵器密度大，跨域作战行动频繁，在相对较小的战场范围内，联合行动更容易产生空域、时域、频域冲突，使得联合作战组织更为复杂。以近海登陆作战为例，不仅包括陆军和海军陆战队的登陆作战、空军的制空作战、海军的制海作战等单域行动，还包括陆军和空军的反舰、反潜作战，海军舰炮和巡航导弹对陆攻击等跨域行动。这些行动紧密交织相互影响，使得联合作战协同要求更为精确，组织也更为复杂。 加强域接合部能力建设是未来战争准备的重要内容 作为未来战争的必争之地，域接合部是可以涌现多种新质战斗力的“富矿”。下好未来战争准备的先手棋，应深研域接合部作战制胜机理，针对域接合部战场特点，持续加强域接合部能力建设。 一体统筹各军种域接合部能力发展。应该依据国情、军情和使命任务，一体统筹各军种能力结构。鼓励包容各军种依据实际作战需要，适当发展与其他军种重叠性的跨域作战能力，以适度的能力冗余，增强遂行域接合部作战任务的适应性和鲁棒性。在不搞“一刀切”的同时，也应充分考虑各军种职能分工和能力优长，避免军种能力的盲目扩张。 积极创新域接合部跨域协同机制。充分借鉴强国军队经验做法，针对不同类型的域接合部，加强军种合作与联合训练，打通跨域杀伤链，创新针对不同域接合部的多种跨域协同机制，如陆海空一体联合打击近海水面目标协同机制等。 加快发展域接合部作战技术和装备。积极探索跨水空介质通信、空天穿梭飞行、异构网络通信“中间件”等跨域作战支撑技术，提高各作战域互联互通互操作与跨域机动能力。推进作战平台和精导弹药多能化，加快发展跨域作战装备，如跨水空介质飞行器、跨空天飞行器等跨域作战平台，以及集反舰、防空、反导、对地打击等功能于一体的全域作战弹药。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230407000547/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214771.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230411111612/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214771.html,2023-04-07 0:00:00,"In future wars, the domain interface will attract attention as the focal point of the joint domain battlefield Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Yuan Yi Zhang Yujun Li Zhifei Editor-in-chief: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-06 07:42:41 0","● significant operational value ● organization and command complex ● new quality of war power ""mine"" domain interface: the future of the war must be fought ■ Yuan Yi Zhang Yujun Li Zhifei Core Tip With the rapid development of military science and technology and the growing expansion of the combat space, the type of modern war combat domain is more rich and diverse, and the degree of convergence between the various combat domains to further deepen. Just as multidisciplinary fusion and collision will produce cutting-edge cross-disciplinary, the cross-fertilization of the combat domains will also produce a strategically important and significant operational value of the ""domain interface"", and thus give rise to a series of new actions and new styles of new methods of warfare, emergence of a new quality of combat power. The concept of ""interface"" originated in the land battlefield, refers to the place where the operational deployment of two forces is connected. In this article, the ""domain interface"" refers to the connection between the land, sea, air, sky, electricity, network and other combat domains. For example, the land-sea interface of the coastal area and offshore, the air-sky interface of the low-orbit and suborbital, the network domain and the cognitive domain interface of the network cognitive domain, and the electromagnetic domain interface of the net-electricity domain, etc. In the past wars, different domains in the land battlefield were connected. In past wars, the interface between different forces in the land battlefield was often a weak point in the deployment of forces, and was a breakthrough for seeking to unexpectedly tear open the opponent's defenses and launch a deep attack. In future wars, the fight for comprehensive control of the battlefield may first center around the domain interface, which will attract attention as the focal point of the entire joint global battlefield. Domain interface has become the basic point of the multi-domain expansion of military combat capability Usually, each military branch has its own corresponding advantageous combat domain, for these exclusive ""reserved land"", other military branches due to the division of labor and capacity constraints are often difficult to get involved in, such as the army's urban and mountainous battlefield, the navy's sea and deep sea battlefield, the sky army's high orbit and deep space battlefield, and so on. Deep Space Battlefield of the Sky Army, etc. From the strong military construction development practice, with the development of cross-domain combat technology and means, in order to seek to play a greater role in joint operations, the expansion of the combat capabilities of the various military branches, coincidentally pointed to the edge of the superiority of this branch of the combat domain and the neighboring combat domain of the domain interface. The fundamental reason for this is that the domain interface has an important strategic position and significant operational value. The strategic position of the domain interface is extremely important. From the geostrategic point of view, for the strength of similar opponents, based on their own geographic characteristics, often in a combat domain has a comparative advantage, such as those who specialize in land combat, some have the advantage of the sea. At the beginning of the conflict, they will try to avoid entering each other's dominant domains first, and each opponent will usually collide and compete with each other at the edge of their respective dominant domains, i.e., the domains' joints. War practice shows that, like land power and sea power confrontation, the former should first rely on the land to control the sea, to obtain the advantage of the sea, and then to the far sea expansion; the latter also need to use the sea advantage from the sea to the land, the first to obtain the advantage of the sea, and then to the continent to the expansion of the depth of the sea. At this time, the land area and the sea interface of the sea, the focus of the confrontation between the two sides of the battlefield, who first in the domain interface to obtain advantages, who will be able to pre-empt the suppression of opponents. Domain interface has significant operational value. Domain interface is a region where two or more combat domains overlap each other, with innate multi-domain characteristics, which can not only influence multiple domains with one domain's actions, but also focus on one domain with multiple domains' capabilities, and effectively bring into play the complementary advantages of the combat domains in the combat mechanism, combat power, and combat time and space, so as to bring together multi-domain combat resources within a limited battlefield, and create complexity for the opponents. In the domain interface, a target can quickly close a number of different types of cross-domain killing chain, forcing the opponent to avoid the strike of a combat domain forces at the same time, but also exposed to the strike range of another combat domain forces, making it difficult to cope with multi-domain and multi-directional threats, and thus fall into multiple dilemmas. Domain interface combat is a litmus test to measure the level of joint operations In the future, with the development of the military branches to the direction of ""multi-functionality"", the combat capabilities of the military branches will be overlapping coverage in the domain interface. In the entire joint domain battlefield, the joint degree of the domain interface combat will be the deepest, the most complex situation, the most difficult to organize, will become a measure of the level of an army's joint operation is very representative of the combat style. Cross-domain operations are normalized. In the domain interface, the military services to use their own constantly enriched cross-domain combat means, to other combat domains continue to exert influence, resulting in the Army long-range rocket artillery anti-ship, anti-submarine, Air Force aircraft mines, anti-ships, naval ships anti-missile, anti-defense, Tianjun on-orbit strikes on the ground and other cross-domain operations, greatly enriched the means of combat and the type of target matching, on the same target can be comprehensively applied to multiple domains of multi-type means of combat, generating a variety of composite strike programs. Generate a variety of composite strike program. The joint operations, cross-domain operations and single-domain operations are closely coordinated to provide more combat options for achieving combat objectives, which is conducive to the formation of greater combat advantages, and thus will gradually become the norm. The joint combat style is rich. In the entire battlefield system, the domain interface as the intersection of multiple combat domain capabilities, with multi-domain adjacency, connecting the characteristics of multiple domains, through cross-domain synergies, multi-domain aggregation, giving rise to a series of new styles of joint operations. National armies have put forward the air-ground integrated warfare, air-sea integrated warfare, air and space integrated warfare, network and electricity integrated warfare and other combat concepts, are trying to focus on the domain interface, unleashing the huge combat potential of the two domains together. In the future, with the continuous enhancement of cross-domain combat means and capabilities, the possible situation of domain-domain intersection will be developed from two-domain conjunction to multi-domain combination and all-domain jointness, thus generating richer combat styles. The organization of joint operations is complex. In the domain interface combat, the participating forces are diversified, the density of troops and weapons, cross-domain combat operations are frequent, in a relatively small battlefield range, joint operations are more likely to produce airspace, time domain, frequency domain conflict, making the joint combat organization more complex. Offshore landing operations, for example, not only includes the landing operations of the Army and Marine Corps, the Air Force's air operations, the Navy's sea operations and other single-domain operations, but also includes the Army and the Air Force's anti-ship, anti-submarine operations, the Navy's naval artillery and cruise missiles on the land attack and other cross-domain operations. These actions are closely intertwined and interact with each other, making the joint combat coordination requirements more precise and the organization more complex. Strengthening the domain interface capacity building is an important part of the preparation for future wars As a place where future wars will be fought, the domain interface is a ""rich mine"" that can produce a variety of new combat capabilities. To make a good first move in preparing for future wars, we should deeply study the mechanism of victory in domain-junction operations, and continue to strengthen domain-junction capacity building in light of the characteristics of domain-junction battlefields. Integrate the development of domain-junction capabilities of all military branches as a whole. The capability structure of all military branches should be integrated on the basis of national conditions, military conditions and missions. Encourage the inclusion of all military services in the development of overlapping cross-domain combat capabilities with other military services based on actual operational needs, so as to enhance the adaptability and robustness of attempting domain-adjacent combat missions with moderate redundancy of capabilities. While not engaging in a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, it should also take into full consideration the division of functions and strengths of the military services, and avoid blind expansion of the capabilities of the military services. We should actively innovate the mechanism of cross-domain synergy in the domain interface. Drawing on the experiences and practices of the armies of powerful countries, we should strengthen cooperation and joint training among the military services for different types of domain-adjacent sites, open up cross-domain killing chains, and innovate a variety of cross-domain synergistic mechanisms for different domain-adjacent sites, such as the synergistic mechanism for joint land-, sea-, and air-integrated strikes against offshore and water-surface targets. Accelerate the development of domain-junction combat technology and equipment. Actively explore cross-water and air media communications, air and space shuttle flights, heterogeneous network communications ""middleware"" and other cross-domain combat support technologies, and improve the interoperability and interoperability of various combat domains and cross-domain mobility. It is promoting the multifunctionalization of combat platforms and precision missile munitions, and accelerating the development of cross-domain combat equipment, such as cross-water and air-media vehicles, cross-space vehicles and other cross-domain combat platforms, as well as all-domain combat munitions integrating anti-ship, anti-aircraft, anti-missile and ground-attack functions.","The domain interface, where various combat domains overlap, is an important focus of future wars. It has significant operational value as it allows for a variety of cross-domain military operations. The article outlines the types of cross-domain operations conducted, such as air-to-sea and land-to-sea attacks, and emphasizes the importance of strengthening domain-junction capacity building. It also mentions the challenges of coordinating multi-service operations in such a complex environment. The focus on the domain interface is seen as a strategic point of attack in joint operations and a potential source of a new quality of combat power."
发扬历史主动精神，以只争朝夕状态建功强军事业 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：范 晶 责任编辑：王韵 2023-04-04 06:21:11 0,发扬历史主动精神 ——以只争朝夕状态建功强军事业① ■范 晶 ●实践证明，发扬历史主动精神是赢得伟大斗争、开创伟大事业的重要法宝，是战胜艰难险阻、实现奋斗目标的力量源泉 “强国建设、民族复兴的接力棒，历史地落在我们这一代人身上。”如何跑好我们这一棒？习主席在第十四届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上强调，我们要只争朝夕，坚定历史自信，增强历史主动。作为新时代革命军人，就是要发扬历史主动精神，以“朝受命、夕饮冰”的使命感，“昼无为、夜难寐”的紧迫感，不等不靠、主动作为，埋头苦干、真抓实干，奋力把新时代强军事业推向前进。 “胜负之征，精神先见。”历史主动精神具有深厚的历史底蕴、鲜明的时代特征和广泛的现实基础，集中体现了共产党人把握历史发展规律和大势，肩负历史使命，自信自强、守正创新、奋发作为，把党的事业不断推向前进的宝贵品格。这种历史主动精神，是指作为历史主体的人充分发挥主观能动性，在深刻把握历史规律的基础上，立足所处的历史方位，顺应历史发展大势，勇于抓住历史机遇，自觉肩负历史责任，主动担当历史使命，勇于开创未来的精神品质。党的十八大以来，我们之所以能够创造出一个个彪炳史册的伟大成就，一个重要原因就是坚持和发扬了历史主动精神。历史是最好的营养剂，也是宝贵的启示录。实践证明，发扬历史主动精神是赢得伟大斗争、开创伟大事业的重要法宝，是战胜艰难险阻、实现奋斗目标的力量源泉。 当前，距离实现建军一百年奋斗目标只有不到5年时间。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。”精神所在，就是力量所在。能不能发扬历史主动精神，事关重大、事关成败、事关长远。面对现代战争形态加速演变的新趋势，面对我国由大向强发展的新形势，面对我军使命任务拓展的新要求，广大官兵只有发扬历史主动精神，增强“全力以赴、务期必成”的决心意志和“快马加鞭未下鞍”的紧迫意识，看清历史大势、把准前进方向，努力做到因势而谋、应势而动、顺势而为，做历史洪流中的引领者、奋进者、搏击者，才能抓住机遇、应对挑战，在时代洪流中牢牢把握事业发展主动权，努力创造无愧于历史和人民的新业绩。 发扬历史主动精神，必须加强理论指导。习主席强调，“拥有马克思主义科学理论指导是我们党坚定信仰信念、把握历史主动的根本所在”。理论武装既能补精神之钙，也是发扬历史主动精神的重要前提和基础。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是当代中国马克思主义、二十一世纪马克思主义，是中华文化和中国精神的时代精华。广大官兵应自觉强化理论武装，把握好习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的世界观和方法论，深刻领会贯穿其中的立场观点方法，方能以高度的理论自信、理论自觉增强历史主动；应坚持理论联系实际，在运用党的创新理论回答和解决实际问题上下功夫，把理论学习成果转化为干事创业的新理念新思路新举措，转化为破解难题、推动高质量发展的实际能力，用指导实践、推动工作的成效增强历史主动。 发扬历史主动精神，必须用好历史经验。我党我军的光辉历史，凝结着中国革命建设奋斗历程的宝贵经验，包含着对党的性质宗旨的深刻认识，蕴含着激励后人的巨大精神力量。刘少奇同志曾指出，我们“必须用中国革命的经验来教育中国的革命者，用中国党的经验来教育中国的党员”，这是“团结全党、教育全党、提高全党以至争取中国革命胜利的最重要的一环”。历史也充分证明，对历史进程的认识越全面，对历史规律的把握越深刻，党的历史智慧越丰富，对前途的掌握就越主动。“所贵乎史者，述往以为来者师也。”广大官兵只有善于把我党我军的历史经验作为正确判断形势、科学预见未来、把握历史主动的重要思想武器，作为想问题、作决策、办事情的重要遵循，作为判断重大政治是非的重要依据，作为加强党性修养的重要指引，才能更加自觉地在“历史之变”中探寻和把握“历史之常”。 发扬历史主动精神，必须增强斗争本领。加强斗争精神和斗争本领养成，是干部历练成长的必经之路，也是进行伟大斗争的迫切需要。斗争本领高强，就会赢得主动，往往能起到四两拨千斤的作用，收到事半功倍的效果。没有斗争本领，发扬历史主动精神就可能会陷于盲目、陷入被动。然而应该看到，斗争本领不是与生俱来的，增强斗争本领，广大官兵需要经受严格的思想淬炼、政治历练、实践锻炼，在复杂严峻的斗争中经风雨、见世面，壮筋骨、长才干，真正把自己锻造成为烈火真金。唯有如此，才是真正发扬历史主动精神，才能以斗争本领的提高，扛起民族复兴和强国强军的历史重任。 发扬历史主动精神，必须强化责任担当。发扬历史主动精神，必然会主动担当；主动担当了，才是真正发扬历史主动精神。当前，我军建设、改革和军事斗争准备任务之重前所未有，矛盾风险挑战之多前所未有，容不得我们慢慢腾腾、疲疲沓沓、拖拖拉拉。“做一朵小小的浪花奔腾，呼啸加入献身者的滚滚洪流中推动历史向前发展”，广大官兵只有争做开路破局的弄潮儿，甘当吃苦耐劳的实干家，勇做尽力尽责的建设者，心思精力向强军兴军聚焦，智慧力量在岗位战位迸发，以主人翁的责任感跑好手中这一棒、脚下这一程，知重负重、苦干实干，把每项工作都干到极致，把每项任务都出色完成，才能在建功强军事业中成就精彩军旅人生。 （作者单位：军事科学院军队政治工作研究院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230407000547/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214377.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230404160753/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16214377.html,2023-04-07 0:00:00,"Carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, and build a strong army in the state of striving only for the night Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Fan Jing Editor-in-Chief: Wang Yun 2023-04-04 06:21:11 0","Carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative - building a strong military career in the state of striving only for the day ① ■ Fan Jing ● practice has proved that the spirit of carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative is an important treasure to win the great struggle and create a great cause, and it is a source of strength to overcome the difficulties and obstacles and realize the goal of the struggle. ""The baton of the construction of a strong country and the rejuvenation of the nation has historically fallen on our generation. , historically falls on our generation."" How to run our baton well? President Xi emphasized at the first meeting of the 14th National People's Congress that we should strive only for the best, strengthen historical confidence and enhance historical initiative. As a revolutionary soldier in the new era, we should carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, with a sense of mission of ""receiving orders in the morning and drinking ice in the evening"", and a sense of urgency of ""doing nothing during the day and having difficulty sleeping at night"", we should not wait or rely on our own initiative to take the initiative to act, and we should work hard and do our best, and strive to push the cause of a strong army in the new era forward. Push forward. ""The victory and defeat of the march, the spirit of the first to see."" The spirit of historical initiative has a deep historical heritage, distinctive characteristics of the times and a broad base of reality, which centrally embodies the valuable character of the Communists in grasping the laws of historical development and the general trend, shouldering the historical mission, self-confidence and self-improvement, guarding the right and innovative, and striving to act, and pushing the Party's cause forward. This spirit of historical initiative refers to the spiritual quality of people as the main body of history to give full play to their subjective initiative, on the basis of profoundly grasping the laws of history, basing on the historical position, adapting to the general trend of historical development, courageously seizing the opportunities of history, consciously shouldering the responsibility of history, taking the initiative to take up the historical mission, and courageously pioneering the future. Since the 18th Party Congress, we have been able to create a history of great achievements, an important reason is to adhere to and carry forward the spirit of historical initiative. History is the best nutrient, but also a valuable revelation. Practice has proved that carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative is an important magic weapon for winning great struggles and creating great undertakings, and it is a source of strength for overcoming difficulties and obstacles and realizing the goals of the struggle. At present, there are less than five years to realize the goal of one hundred years of building the army. ""How many things are never in a hurry; heaven and earth are turning, and time is pressing."" Where the spirit is, is where the power is. The ability to carry forward the spirit of historical initiative is a matter of great importance, success or failure, and the long term. In the face of the new trend of the accelerated evolution of the pattern of modern warfare, in the face of the new situation of our country's development from big to strong, in the face of the new requirements of the expansion of the mission of the army, the majority of officers and soldiers only carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, enhance the ""all-out efforts to make sure to achieve"" the determination of the determination of the will and the ""whip is not saddle! ""The sense of urgency, see the historical trend, the direction, and strive to do because of the situation and plan, respond to the situation and move, follow the trend and do the historical current of the leader, striving for progress, striving, in order to seize the opportunity to deal with the challenges, in the era of the torrent to grasp the initiative of the cause of the development of the efforts to create a new performance worthy of history and the people. To carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, theoretical guidance must be strengthened. President Xi emphasized that ""having the scientific theoretical guidance of Marxism is fundamental to our party's firm faith and beliefs, and grasping the initiative of history."" Theoretical armament can not only replenish the calcium of the spirit, but is also an important prerequisite and foundation for carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century Marxism, and is the essence of the times of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit. The majority of officers and soldiers should consciously strengthen theoretical armament, grasp the worldview and methodology of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and profoundly comprehend the position and viewpoint methodology that runs through it, so as to enhance the historical initiative with a high degree of theoretical self-confidence and theoretical self-consciousness; they should adhere to the theory and practice, and work hard on answering and solving practical problems by applying the Party's innovative theories, so as to turn the results of theoretical learning into New ideas, new ideas and new measures, into cracking the problem, promote high-quality development of the actual ability to guide the practice, promote the effectiveness of the work to enhance the historical initiative. To carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, we must use the historical experience. The glorious history of our party and our army, condensed with the valuable experience of the struggle of the Chinese revolution and construction, contains a profound understanding of the nature and purpose of the party, contains a great spiritual power to inspire future generations. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out that we ""must use the experience of the Chinese revolution to educate Chinese revolutionaries, and use the experience of the Chinese Party to educate Chinese Party members"", which is ""the most important link to unite the whole Party, educate the whole Party, improve the whole Party and even strive for the victory of the Chinese revolution! "". History has also amply proved that the more comprehensive the understanding of the historical process and the deeper the grasp of the laws of history, the richer the Party's historical wisdom and the more proactive its grasp of the future. ""What is valuable to the history of the person, the description of the past for the future of the teacher also."" The majority of officers and soldiers are only good at the historical experience of the Party and our army as an important ideological weapon for correctly judging the situation, scientifically foreseeing the future, and grasping the historical initiative, as an important guideline for thinking, making decisions, and doing things, as an important basis for judging the right and wrong of major politics, and as an important guideline for strengthening the Party's cultivation, so that we can more consciously explore and grasp the historical change in the ""change of history. It is only through this that we can more consciously explore and grasp the ""constant of history"" in the ""change of history"". To carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, it is necessary to enhance the ability to fight. Strengthening the spirit of struggle and struggle skills is the way for cadres to grow up, but also the urgent need to carry out the great struggle. Struggle skill is strong, will win the initiative, often can play the role of four or two pounds, receive twice the result with half the effort. Without the ability to struggle, carry forward the spirit of historical initiative may be trapped in blindness and passivity. However, it should be seen, the struggle is not inherent in the ability to enhance the struggle, the majority of officers and soldiers need to undergo rigorous ideological refinement, political experience, practical exercises, in the complexity and severity of the struggle in the storm, to see the world, strong muscles and bones, long talent, really forging themselves into a blazing fire of real gold. Only in this way, is really carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, in order to improve the ability to struggle, to carry the national rejuvenation and the historical responsibility of strengthening the country and the military. Carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, must strengthen the responsibility to bear. Carry forward the spirit of historical initiative, will inevitably take the initiative to bear; take the initiative to bear, is to really carry forward the spirit of historical initiative. At present, our military construction, reform and preparation for the military struggle is unprecedented, the contradictions and risks and challenges are unprecedented, we can not afford to be slow, tired, procrastination. ""Do a small wave rushing, whistling to join the rolling torrent of dedication to promote the forward development of history"", the majority of officers and soldiers only strive to do to open the way to break the tide, willing to be a hard-working doer, the courage to do their best to do their part in the construction of the mind energy to the strong army to focus on the development of the army, the wisdom of the power of the post in the position of the war eruption to the sense of responsibility of the masters! Run well in the hands of the baton, under the feet of this course, know the weight, hard work, every job to the extreme, every task are excellent completion, in order to build a strong military cause in the achievement of wonderful military life. (Author's unit: Institute of Military Political Work, Academy of Military Sciences)","The article emphasizes the importance of carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative in building a strong military. It argues that this spirit is an essential treasure for winning great struggles and creating great causes, and it is a source of strength to overcome difficulties and obstacles.

Among the ""achievements"" listed towards this proclamation, there is explicit evidence showing China has surpassed some developed countries in 14-year developmental projects which are purely technological. The bureaucracy in China has effectively channeled efforts to balance economic development with societal cohesion and national security goals.

Approaching the challenges, China faces undeniably political machinations as a significant threat. However, they are manageable, thanks to the country's ability to create new developments that meet national needs efficiently. 

The country's investment in developing raw materials necessary for industrialization has put China in a good position to meet imports requirements, while keeping political stability as the highest significance for the Chinese government. 

In summary, the technology development situation in China is good and those challenges that can negatively impact the above developments can be sufficiently managed. 

Additionally, the country can derive benefit from both international and indigenous developments. The Chinese government has been working to maximize these opportunities by working with local companies to create new innovations that meet local needs uniformly. 

Lastly, the military assets of China are proof that regardless of how they are classified, have become highly effective in providing necessary security to the nation at a strategic level."
大兴调查研究之风系列谈丨敢于攻坚克难 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：刘富才 郑博文 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-14 07:27:08 1,敢于攻坚克难 ■刘富才 郑博文 中共中央办公厅印发的《关于在全党大兴调查研究的工作方案》要求，必须坚持攻坚克难，发扬斗争精神，增强斗争本领，勇于涉险滩、破难题，知难而进、迎难而上，把调查研究成果转化为推进工作、战胜困难的实际成效。敢于攻坚克难，方能淬炼成钢。越是接近实现中华民族伟大复兴的目标，越是任务繁重、困难重重，越需要把存在的矛盾困难和风险挑战摸清摸透，以攻坚克难的勇气广泛深入开展调查研究，在闯关夺隘、攻城拔寨中不断取得新胜利。 攻坚克难是共产党人干事创业必备的精神品质和能力素质，也是新征程上开展调查研究必须坚持的重要原则。周恩来同志曾说：“下去调查，要敢于正视困难，解决困难。一个困难问题解决了，新的困难问题又来了。共产党人就是为不断克服困难，继续前进而存在的。畏难苟安，不是共产党人的品质。”调查研究必须敢于攻坚克难，直面矛盾问题，大胆揭短亮丑，在急流险滩面前逆流而上、敢闯敢试，在风险挑战面前迎难而上、敢为人先。通过调查研究剖析矛盾问题背后的深层次原因，制订务实管用的举措，真正解决实际工作中遇到的各种难题，切实把调查研究成果转化为推进工作、战胜困难的实际成效。 要发扬斗争精神。敢于斗争、敢于胜利，是中国共产党不可战胜的强大精神力量。开展调查研究，固然要到工作局面好和先进的地方去总结经验，但更需要到困难多、情况复杂、矛盾尖锐的地方去研究问题、化解矛盾。当前，我们正处于船到中流浪更急、人到半山路更陡的关键时期，必然会面对各种重大挑战、重大风险、重大阻力、重大矛盾，迫切需要在调查研究中发扬斗争精神，找到事物的本质和规律，找到破解难题的办法和路径。调查研究能不能攻坚克难，愿不愿直面问题，敢不敢跳进矛盾漩涡，考验的是党性觉悟，检验的是斗争精神。越是困难大、矛盾多的地方，越是形势严峻、情况复杂的时候，越能练胆魄、磨意志、长才干。党员干部在调查研究过程中要敢于斗争、善于斗争，不惧怕风险挑战、不回避矛盾问题，敢接“烫手山芋”、敢啃“硬骨头”，多到分管领域的基层一线去，多到困难多、群众意见集中、工作打不开局面的地方去，体察实情、解剖麻雀，全面掌握情况，做到心中有数。 要增强攻坚本领。党员干部开展好调查研究，不仅需要政治过硬，还需要本领高强。然而现实工作中，有的党员干部把“调研”变为“调演”，精心设计路线，听标准汇报，沉浸在“脚本”里；有的停留在了解枝节问题、表面现象，不能由表及里、由此及彼……这些现象的出现，既有不愿吃苦、怕麻烦的懒惰思想作怪，也有个人研究问题能力弱、攻坚克难本领不强的因素使然。开展好调查研究，光有一腔热情远远不够，没有几把“刷子”不行。要强化理论武装，学懂弄通做实党的创新理论，掌握蕴含其中的马克思主义立场观点方法，不断锤炼敢于攻坚克难的底气、勇气和胆气。要善于抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，扭住关键性工作，集中优势力量解决“牵一发而动全身”的关键问题，推动调查研究工作取得更大成效。要坚持求真务实的调研作风，紧贴现实需求、紧盯瓶颈问题，不做表面文章、不耍花拳绣腿，扑下身子干实事、谋实招、求实效，以优良作风推动矛盾问题解决。 要注重成果转化。衡量调查研究搞得好不好，关键要看能不能把实际问题解决好。调查研究要注重实效，才能使调研的过程成为加深对党的创新理论领悟的过程、成为保持同人民群众血肉联系的过程、成为推动事业发展的过程。要防止为调研而调研，防止搞“出发一车子、开会一屋子、发言念稿子”式的调研，避免扎堆调研、“作秀式”调研。调查研究的目的，在于深入一线发现问题、拿出对策解决问题、推动工作提质增效。做好调查研究的“后半篇文章”，重点要在运用调研成果改进工作、推动发展上下功夫见成效。党员干部应增强对调研成果转化为工作实效重要性的认识，对现有的调研成果认真归纳和梳理，有指导价值、实际意义的要重点研究，并据此制订科学决策；对没有调查彻底、一时拿不准的，要继续深入调查、反复论证；对本级解决不了、需上级解决的，必须实事求是地向上级反映，只有让上级了解真实情况，才能更加有效地落实工作指导。实践检验成果，实绩推动发展。调查研究要走深走实，必须做好“后半篇文章”，真正把调查研究成果转化为推进工作、战胜困难的实际成效。 （作者单位：南部战区陆军）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230415235541/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216839.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230420202712/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216839.html,2023-04-16 0:00:00,Daxing the Wind of Investigation and Research Series Talk 丨 Dare to Tackle Difficulties Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Liu Fucai Zheng Bowen Editor-in-Chief: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-14 07:27:08 1,"Dare to overcome difficulties ■ Liu Fu Choy Zheng Bowen issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, ""on the whole party in the work of the program of investigation and research"" requires that we must adhere to overcome difficulties, carry forward the spirit of struggle, enhance the ability to struggle, the courage to wade through dangerous shoals, break the problem, know the difficulties, meet the challenges, the results of the investigation and research into the promotion of the work of overcoming the difficulties of the actual results. Dare to overcome difficulties, can be hardened into steel.

Overcoming difficulties is the necessary spiritual quality and ability quality for communists to work and start business, and it is also an important principle that must be adhered to in carrying out investigation and research on the new journey. Comrade Zhou Enlai once said: ""Go down to investigate, we must dare to face up to difficulties and solve them. After a difficult problem is solved, new difficult problems come again.

To carry forward the spirit of struggle. Dare to struggle, dare to win, is the CPC invincible powerful spiritual force. Carry out research, of course, to the work of the situation is good and advanced to sum up the experience, but more need to go to the difficulties, complexity, sharp contradictions in the place to study the problem, resolve the contradictions. At present, we are in the boat to the middle of the more urgent, people to halfway up the mountain road more steep critical period, is bound to face a variety of major challenges, major risks, major resistance, major contradictions, there is an urgent need to carry forward the spirit of the struggle in the investigation and research, to find the essence of things and the law, to find the way to crack the problem and the path. Investigation and research can overcome difficulties, willing to face the problem, dare to jump into the vortex of contradictions, the test is the party consciousness, the test is the spirit of struggle. The more difficult, contradictory places, the more serious the situation, the more complex the time, the more can practice courage, grinding will, long ability. Party members and cadres in the investigation and research process should dare to struggle, good at struggle, not afraid of the risk of challenges, do not avoid the contradictions, dare to take the ""hot potato"", dare to gnaw ""hard bones"", more to the field of management of the grass-roots level to go, more to the difficulties, the masses of concentrated opinions, The work can not open the situation of the place to go, physical observation of the actual situation, anatomy of the sparrow, a comprehensive grasp of the situation, to do a good understanding of the situation. To enhance the ability to attack. Party members and cadres to carry out good research, not only need to be politically tough, but also need to be strong. However, the reality of work, some party members and cadres to ""research"" into a ""tune-up"", elaborate routes, listen to the standard report, immersed in the ""script""; some stay in the understanding of the Branches of the problem, surface phenomena, can not be from the table and inside, from and to ...... the emergence of these phenomena, both reluctant to suffer, afraid of trouble, lazy thinking, but also the ability to study the problem of personal weakness, the ability to overcome the difficulties of the factors that make it not strong. Carry out a good survey and research, just a passion is not enough, there are no a few ""brushes"" can not. To strengthen the theoretical armament, learn and understand the Party's innovative theories, master the Marxist position and viewpoints contained therein, and constantly refine the courage to overcome the difficulties of the bottom, courage and boldness. We should be good at grasping the main contradictions and the main aspects of the contradictions, twisting the key work, focusing on the advantageous strength to solve the key problems of the ""one hair affects the whole body"", and promote the investigation and research work to achieve greater results. To adhere to the pragmatic style of research, close to the reality of demand, focusing on bottlenecks, do not do superficial articles, do not play the fist fist, get down to do practical things, make practical moves, seek practical results, to promote the excellent style of conflict resolution. To focus on the transformation of results. Measure the investigation and research is good or not, the key to see whether the actual problem can be solved.

To prevent research for the research, to prevent the ""departure of a car, a meeting of a room, speech reading script"" type of research, to avoid a pile of research, ""show"" research. The purpose of investigation and research is to go into the front line to find problems, come up with countermeasures to solve problems, and promote the work of quality and efficiency. Do a good job of investigation and research, ""the second half of the article"", focusing on the use of research results to improve the work and promote the development of efforts to see results.

“练好调查研究基本功”系列谈丨真研究问题 研究真问题 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：贾乾 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-13 06:39:31 0,真研究问题 研究真问题 ——“练好调查研究基本功”系列谈之三 ■贾乾 ●党员干部在调查研究中坚持问题导向，增强问题意识，就要在“真研究问题、研究真问题”上下功夫，如此才能找到解决问题的办法，更好地破解改革发展难题 前不久，中共中央办公厅印发了《关于在全党大兴调查研究的工作方案》，要求“必须坚持问题导向，增强问题意识，敢于正视问题、善于发现问题，以解决问题为根本目的，真正把情况摸清、把问题找准、把对策提实，不断提出真正解决问题的新思路新办法”。党员干部在调查研究中坚持问题导向，增强问题意识，就要在“真研究问题、研究真问题”上下功夫，如此才能找到解决问题的办法，更好地破解改革发展难题。 问题是时代的声音，坚持问题导向是马克思主义的鲜明特点。党员干部搞调查研究，根本目的就是为了解决问题。要想把问题解决好，当务之急需要认真研究问题。真研究问题和研究真问题是研究问题的两个方面，即以什么样的态度和作风研究问题和研究什么样的问题，只有把握好这两个方面，调查研究才能取得实实在在的效果。当前，我军建设正处在提质增效的关键阶段，有很多建设规划亟盼紧前推进，有很多创新举措亟须谋深落实，有很多现实矛盾问题亟待研究解决，这些都迫切需要党员干部深入调查研究，坚持问题导向，把真研究问题和研究真问题统一起来，准确把握问题的本质和规律，寻找解决问题的最佳方案，不断开创工作新局面。 坚持问题导向，必须真研究问题。真研究问题体现了调查研究的态度和作风。只有扑下身子、沉到基层，真正把情况摸清、把问题找准的研究才是真研究。凡是浮皮潦草、粗枝大叶、马马虎虎的研究都不是真研究。党员干部要深入困难较多、情况复杂、矛盾尖锐、官兵意见多的单位去调研，不能嫌麻烦、图省事。要拿出老老实实的态度、扎扎实实的作风，深入剖析研究基层单位存在的问题，不能只做材料的统计师、收集员，不做材料的分析师、研究员，坚决防止提出的对策建议和基层存在的真问题不搭边、不相符。要在深入分析思考上下功夫，对调研得来的大量材料和情况，要做到去粗取精、去伪存真，由此及彼、由表及里，既要进行横向比对，了解同一问题在不同单位的表现形式，又要进行纵向梳理，摸清问题的来龙去脉，弄清问题的变化趋势，找出基层矛盾问题产生的根源，进而找到解决问题的最佳办法。 坚持问题导向，必须研究真问题。所谓“真问题”，是指那些工作生活中客观存在，具有一定研究价值、别人没有研究过或研究还不深入、尚未得到有效解决的问题。对于军队而言，如影响推动军队高质量发展的重难点问题、制约备战打仗的瓶颈问题、阻碍部队建设发展的历史遗留问题、官兵反映强烈的现实问题等等，都是需要重点研究解决的。调研过程中，面对大量的第一手资料，哪些是真正影响部队发展、影响战斗力提升的真问题，哪些是雷声大雨点小、不痛不痒的伪问题，党员干部要练就一双“慧眼”，特别注意甄别，真正把时间精力用在刀刃上。同时，调研过程中还应注意走出“主观主义”的误区，不能带着框子找例子、带着论点找论据，把调查研究变成结论的预设。如此，才能抓住那些具有代表性、普遍性、全局性的真问题。 真研究问题、研究真问题，最终要落在真解决问题上。如果调查研究后只提出方案对策，没有抓好随后的整改落实，那么，再好的方案对策都将是一纸空文。党员干部要对调研中反映和发现的问题，逐一梳理形成问题清单、责任清单、任务清单，逐一列出解决措施、责任单位、责任人和完成时限。对短期能够解决的，立行立改、马上就办。对一时难以解决、需要持续推进的，明确目标、紧盯不放、一抓到底，做到问题不解决不松劲、解决不彻底不放手，确保决策部署真正落地见效。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230415235541/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216405.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230414025444/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216405.html,2023-04-16 0:00:00,"The series of talks on ""practicing the basic skills of investigation and research"" 丨 real research problems research real problems Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Jia Qian Responsibility: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-13 06:39:31 0","The research problem research real problems - ""practice good investigation and research basic skills"" series of three ■ Jia Qian ● party members and cadres in the investigation and research adhere to the problem-oriented, enhance the awareness of the problem, we must be in the ""real research problems, research real problems"" on the effort, so as to find solutions to the problem of reform and development. Problems"" on the effort, so that we can find ways to solve problems, better crack the reform and development problems Not long ago, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued the ""on the whole party to promote investigation and research of the work program,"" requiring that ""we must adhere to the problem-oriented, enhance the awareness of the problem, and dare to face the problem, good at discovering the problem to solve the problem as the fundamental purpose, and really find out the situation clearly, to solve the problem. The fundamental purpose of the real situation to find out, find the right problem, the countermeasures to mention the real, and constantly put forward new ideas and new ways to really solve the problem. Party members and cadres in the investigation and research to adhere to the problem-oriented, enhance the awareness of the problem, we must ""really study the problem, the study of the real problem"" on the effort, so that we can find ways to solve the problem, better crack the reform and development problems. The problem is the voice of the times, adhere to the problem-oriented is the distinctive feature of Marxism. Party members and cadres to engage in research, the fundamental purpose is to solve problems. In order to solve the problem well, it is imperative that the problem needs to be studied seriously. Really study the problem and study the real problem is the study of the two aspects of the problem, that is, with what kind of attitude and style of research and study what kind of problem, only grasp these two aspects, research can achieve tangible results. At present, our military construction is in the key stage of improving quality and efficiency, there are many construction plans urgently look forward to immediately before the advancement of a lot of innovative initiatives are urgently needed to plan the implementation of the depth of the reality of a lot of contradictions and problems need to be studied and resolved, there is an urgent need for party members and cadres to conduct in-depth investigation and research, adhere to the problem-oriented, the real research and study the real problems and problems, and to accurately grasp the essence of the problem and the law, and look for solutions to the problem of the best program! In the past, we have been able to create a new situation for our work. Adhere to the problem-oriented, must really study the problem. Real research problems reflect the attitude and style of investigation and research. Only to jump down, sink to the grassroots level, really clear the situation, to find the problem of the research is true research. Where the scribbling, sloppy, sloppy research is not real research. Party members and cadres should go deep into the more difficult, complex situation, sharp contradictions, officers and soldiers have more opinions of the unit to research, can not be too much trouble, trying to save trouble. To come up with an honest attitude, solid style, in-depth analysis of the problems of the grass-roots units, can not only do the material statistician, collector, do not do the material analysts, researchers, and resolutely prevent the proposed countermeasures and recommendations and grass-roots existence of real problems do not match, do not match. To work on in-depth analysis and thinking, a large number of materials and information from the research, we must do the rough to extract the essence, to remove the false and keep the true, from the other, from the table to the inside, not only horizontal comparison, to understand the same problem in different units of the manifestations, but also to carry out vertical sorting, to find out the ins and outs of the problem, to figure out the problem of the changing trend, to find out the grass-roots contradiction in the root causes of the problem, and then find the best way to solve the problem. The best way to solve problems. Adhere to the problem-oriented, must study the real problem. The so-called ""real problems"" refers to the objective existence of those working life, with a certain research value, others have not studied or research is not in-depth, has not yet been effectively resolved. For the army, such as the impact of the army to promote the high-quality development of the important and difficult problems, constraints on the preparation for war bottlenecks, impede the development of the historical legacy of the construction of the army, officers and soldiers reflect the strong reality of the problem and so on, are required to focus on the research and solution. Research process, in the face of a large amount of first-hand information, which is really affecting the development of the troops, affecting the combat effectiveness of the real problem, which is a lot of rain, no pain, no gain pseudo-problems, party members and cadres to practice a pair of ""eyes"", pay special attention to screening, really use the time and energy in the knife's edge. At the same time, the research process should also pay attention to get out of the ""subjectivism"" of the misunderstanding, not with the box to find examples, with the argument to find arguments, research into the conclusion of the preset. In this way, in order to seize those representative, universal, global real problems. Real research problems, research real problems, and ultimately to fall on the real problem solving. If the investigation and research only put forward program countermeasures, no grasp of the subsequent rectification and implementation, then, again, good program countermeasures will be a piece of paper. Party members and cadres should be reflected in the research and found that the problem, one by one, combed to form a list of problems, responsibility list, task list, one by one, listed the solution measures, responsible units, responsible persons and completion time limit. For short-term can be resolved, immediate reform, immediately. For a moment difficult to solve, the need to continue to promote, clear goals, keep a close eye on, grasp the end, to do not let up until the problem is solved, solve not completely do not let go, to ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the real implementation of the effect.","This article discusses the importance of conducting research on real problems in order to effectively solve them. It highlights that party members and cadres must adhere to the problem-oriented approach, focusing on truly understanding the issues and finding practical solutions. The writer suggests that it is essential to study real problems, which are those that exist in reality and have research value. The military's focus should be on tackling the important and difficult issues that hinder the high-quality development of the army and the effectiveness of its combat readiness. The party members and cadres are encouraged to thoroughly investigate and analyze the grass-roots units' problems to prevent proposed countermeasures and recommendations from not matching the real issues. They must also be mindful of identifying representative, universal, and global real problems. The ultimate goal is to solve the identified problems, and it is reiterated that research on real problems must lead to real solutions that are implemented effectively."
以只争朝夕状态建功强军事业丨大力弘扬实干作风 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：马红晖 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-13 06:37:34 0,大力弘扬实干作风 ——以只争朝夕状态建功强军事业④ ■马红晖 ●只有真抓才能攻坚克难，只有实干才能梦想成真 习主席在第十四届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上指出：“要全面推进国防和军队现代化建设，把人民军队建设成为有效维护国家主权、安全、发展利益的钢铁长城。”号角嘹亮，使命在肩。前行在充满挑战的新征程上，向着如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标、加快把人民军队建成世界一流军队阔步迈进，肩负强军重任的新时代革命军人，如何才能不辱使命、不负韶华，立足本职岗位、建功强军事业？ 历史和现实告诉我们：实干是最质朴的方法论。只有真抓才能攻坚克难，只有实干才能梦想成真。广大官兵只有大力弘扬实干作风，切实把自己摆进事业中，把责任扛在肩膀上，快马加鞭冲锋在前，紧锣密鼓干在实处，夙兴夜寐拼搏奋进，做实做细做好各项工作，才能把新时代强军事业不断推向前进。 大道至简，实干为要。世界上的事情都是实实在在干出来的，“不干，半点马克思主义都没有”。党的十八大以来，国防和军队建设取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，离不开“实干”二字。没有实干，新的体制机制无法迅速展开运行；没有实干，备战打仗要求无法扎实落地；没有实干，党在新时代的强军目标无法蹄疾步稳推进……正是靠实干，我们才能不断创造一个又一个强军新业绩。当前，距离实现建军一百年奋斗目标已不到5年时间，既有“快马加鞭未下鞍”的紧迫，更有“一山放过一山拦”的跋涉。广大官兵必须牢记空谈误事、实干兴军的质朴道理，坚持一切从实际出发、一切从实战出发，撸起袖子勤勉肯干，甩开膀子真抓实干，扑下身子埋头苦干，迈开步子紧张快干，竭尽全力在新时代强军赛道上跑出加速度、闯出新天地。 大力弘扬实干作风，就要踔厉奋发、昂扬奋进，意气风发不懈怠。良好的精神状态是干事创业的“内动力”。90多年来，我军之所以能够跨过千山万水，经过千磨万击，闯过千难万险，成为一支有信心、有能力打败一切来犯之敌的威武之师、胜利之师、文明之师，一个重要因素，就是无论面临多少艰难险阻，面对多少强敌对手，都永不言败、永不懈怠、永不退缩。同样，一个人无论面对顺境还是逆境、胜利还是挫折，都能做到精神上不萎靡、不消沉、不彷徨，坚定不移做好自己的事情，必能踏平坎坷成大道。当前，强军事业已站在新的起点上，摆在我们面前的使命更光荣、任务更艰巨、挑战更严峻。广大官兵应自觉把人生坐标锚定在强军事业上，以争当骨干、争做先锋的进取心态，时不我待、只争朝夕的昂扬状态，干在实处、敢为人先的奋斗姿态，把各项任务高标准完成好，把矛盾问题高效率解决好，把部队建设高质量发展好。 大力弘扬实干作风，就要笃实谋事、务实干事，脚踏实地不飘浮。事业的高峰是由无数平凡的沙砾堆砌而成的，只有脚踏实地、埋头苦干，一步一个脚印地朝着目标前行，才能在平凡岗位上成就不平凡的人生。“最美新时代革命军人”何贤达以“练出最硬本领、争当一流好兵”为目标，脚踏实地在平凡岗位默默奋斗，把每一件事情都做出精彩，把每一项工作都干到极致，最终一步步成长为“导弹兵王”。与之相反，现实中有些人之所以难以登上事业的高峰，很多时候并不是输在才干上，而是败在心浮气躁上。这些人想取得一番业绩，却又不愿脚踏实地、埋头苦干，常常是只说不做、眼高手低，最终在怨天尤人、碌碌无为中把平凡变成了平庸。应当看到，每一项事业不论大小，都是靠脚踏实地、一点一滴干出来的。广大官兵要把脚踏实地当作成就事业的重要品质，面对长远规划不好高骛远，面对现实任务不盲目蛮干，面对矛盾问题不推诿扯皮，在踏踏实实抓好每一项工作、扎扎实实完成好每一项任务中，推动部队全面建设“更上一层楼”。 大力弘扬实干作风，就要久久为功、善作善成，不见成效不收兵。世上没有从天而降的辉煌，也没有一蹴而就的成功。但凡事业有成者，总是葆有坚定的信心和干事创业的朝气，兼顾长远与现实，全力打好攻坚战和持久战，并且在大我与小我之间勇于牺牲奉献。林俊德在大漠戈壁奋战半个多世纪，为我国潜心铸造大国重器；钱七虎为我国铸就“地下钢铁长城”，一干就是一个甲子……正是靠着愚公移山的志气、坚忍不拔的韧劲和滴水穿石的毅力，他们不仅在平凡岗位上实现了人生价值，更铸就了坚不可摧的强军大厦。广大官兵作为强军事业的一颗颗“螺丝钉”，既要涵养功成不必在我的高尚情操，又要展现功成必定有我的事业追求，定下目标就要横下一条心，看准的事情就要铆足一股劲，心无旁骛、锲而不舍，一锤接着一锤敲，把工作往深里抓、往实里抓、往细里抓，不见成效不撒手，朝着既定目标奋力前行。 实干者天不负，有志者事竟成。新时代强军事业需要人人重实干、事事求实干、时时讲实干。前进道路上，广大官兵应当大力弘扬实干作风，不做虚功、不兴伪事，求真务实、真抓实干，让实干的氛围浓起来，在波澜壮阔的强军新征程上奏响时代强音。 （作者单位：江苏省南京警备区）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230415235541/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216404.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230414055333/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16216404.html,2023-04-16 0:00:00,Build a Strong Military Career in the State of Striving Only for the Night丨Vigorously Carrying Forward the Style of Practical Work Source：China Military Network - PLA Daily Author：Ma Honghui Responsibility：Yu Yaqian 2023-04-13 06:37:34 0,"The first time I was in the country, I was in the middle of a long journey, and I was in the middle of a long journey, and I was in the middle of a long journey. The people's army is being built into an iron and steel wall that effectively safeguards the country's sovereignty, security and development interests."" The clarion call is loud and clear, and the mission is on our shoulders. Marching on a new journey full of challenges, towards the realization of the army's 100-year goal on schedule, accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army stride, shoulder the heavy responsibility of strengthening the army of the new era of revolutionary soldiers, how can we do not dishonor the mission, not to live up to Shaohua, based on their own positions, to build the cause of a strong army? History and reality tell us: practical work is the most pristine methodology. Only the real grasp to overcome difficulties, only practical work to dream come true. The majority of officers and soldiers only vigorously carry forward the style of practical work, effectively put themselves into the cause, the responsibility on the shoulders, fast and furious in the front, tightly dry in the real, long-time sleep and hard work, do a good job to do a good job, in order to the new era of the cause of the strong army to continue to move forward. The road is simple, practical work is important. Things in the world are practical out of, ""do not do, half Marxism are not"". Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the national defense and military construction has made historic achievements and changes, inseparable from the word ""do"". There is no work, the new institutional mechanism can not quickly start operation; no work, preparation for war requirements can not be solid landing; no work, the party in the new era of the strong military goals can not be hoofed to promote ...... is to rely on the work, we can continue to create one after another new performance of the strong military. Currently, less than five years from the realization of the army's goal of one hundred years of struggle, both ""fast horse whip not under the saddle"" of the urgency, but also ""a mountain to let go of a mountain stop"" trekking. The majority of officers and soldiers must bear in mind that empty talk is a mistake, the simple reasoning of the army, adhere to all from the actual starting point, all from the actual combat, roll up their sleeves and diligently willing to do, open up the bladder to really do, put down their bodies to bury their heads in the hard work, and open the pace of nervousness and fast drying, and do their best to run out of acceleration in the new era of the army on the race track, break into new horizons. Vigorously carry forward the style of work, we must be vigorous, spirited, spirited and not slack. A good state of mind is the ""internal power"" of the officers and entrepreneurs. 90 years, the reason why our army can cross thousands of mountains and rivers, after thousands of grinding, through thousands of difficulties and dangers, to become a confident, capable of defeating all the enemies of the mighty, victorious, civilized division, an important factor is that no matter how many difficulties and obstacles, how many strong enemy face, how many people, how many people, how many people, how many people, how many people, how many people. An important factor is that no matter how many difficulties and dangers we face, and how many strong enemies and opponents we face, we will never give up, never slacken off, and never retreat. Similarly, a person, whether facing good times or adversity, victory or setback, can do not be spiritually depressed, not depressed, not at a loss, and unswervingly do their own thing, will be able to smooth out the bumps into the road. At present, the strong military industry has stood on a new starting point, in front of us the mission is more honorable, the task is more difficult, the challenge is more severe. The majority of officers and soldiers should consciously anchor their life coordinates in the cause of the strong military, in order to be the backbone of the vanguard of the enterprising mentality, the time is not waiting, just strive for a vigorous state of mind, dry in the field, dare to be the first in the struggle posture, the task to complete the task of a high standard, the contradictions and problems of high efficiency to solve the good quality of the construction of the troops to the development of the good. Vigorously carry forward the style of practical work, we must be pragmatic, pragmatic officers, down-to-earth not floating. The peak of the cause is piled up by countless ordinary gravel, only down-to-earth, hard work, one step at a time towards the goal, in order to achieve extraordinary life in ordinary positions. ""The most beautiful revolutionary soldier of the new era"" He Xianda to ""practice the hardest skills, and strive to be a first-class soldier"" as the goal, down-to-earth in ordinary positions quietly struggle, every thing to make a wonderful, every job to the extreme, and ultimately step by step to grow into a ""king of missile soldiers"". ""Missile soldier king"". On the contrary, the reality is that some people are difficult to ascend the peak of the cause, many times is not lost in the talent, but lost in the heart of the restlessness. These people want to achieve some performance, but are not willing to be down-to-earth, hard work, often just say no, low-eye, and ultimately in the grumbling, inaction in the ordinary into mediocrity. It should be seen that every cause, no matter how big or small, is to rely on down-to-earth, bit by bit out of the dry. The majority of officers and soldiers should be down-to-earth as an important quality of achievement, in the face of long-term planning is not over-ambitious, in the face of the reality of the task is not blind, in the face of contradictions and problems are not shirking their responsibilities, in a down-to-earth grasp of every job, to complete a good job of every task, and to promote the overall construction of the force, ""to a higher level"". Vigorously carry forward the style of work, we must work for a long time, good work, do good, do not see the results do not call it a day. The world did not fall from the sky brilliant, there is no overnight success. But all successful career, always have firm confidence and entrepreneurial vigor, taking into account the long term and the reality, to fight a good battle and long-lasting war, and in the big I and I have the courage to sacrifice and dedication. Lin Junde in the desert Gobi fighting for more than half a century, for our country to cast a major weapon; Qian Qi Hu for our country to cast the ""Great Wall of Underground Steel"", a dry is an a child ...... is relying on the ambition of the Foolish Old Man to remove the mountain, perseverance and perseverance and water penetrates the stone of perseverance! They not only realized the value of life in ordinary positions, but also forged an impregnable strong military building. The majority of officers and soldiers as a strong military cause of a ""screw"", not only to cultivate the noble sentiments of the success does not have to be in me, but also to show the success of the pursuit of my career, set a goal to cross a heart, see the things to be riveted to a force, without distractions, perseverance, hammer after hammer to knock the work to the depths of grasp, grasp, grasp, grasp, grasp, and see the details of the work, not see the strong military building. Grasp, to the fine grasp, do not see the results do not put their hands, toward the established goal to move forward. The practical work of the sky will not fail, where there is a will there is a way. The cause of a strong army in the new era requires everyone to be practical, practical in everything, and practical at all times. On the road ahead, the majority of officers and soldiers should vigorously carry forward the style of practical work, do not do false work, do not rise pseudo things, pragmatic, pragmatic, so that the atmosphere of practical work thick, in the magnificent new journey of the army to play the strong sound of the times. (Author's unit: Nanjing police reserve district, Jiangsu Province)","The article highlights the importance of practical work in building a strong military career and achieving the goal of building a world-class military. It emphasizes that the majority of officers and soldiers must be practical, vigorous, spirited, and not slack in their approach to their duties.

Both human and machine realize cyclic alternation and instant interaction, which makes cognitive attack and defense present uninterrupted and normalized characteristics. Intelligent communication is capable of shaping the relationship between users and information in all dimensions, in all times and in all areas, making it more convenient to guide public opinion, shape concepts and guide and control behaviors, and is increasingly becoming a ""brain-control weapon"", and a whole set of cognitive manipulation practices has gradually been developed. With the rapid development of intelligent media and platform technology, intelligent communication has gradually realized the cross-border integration and application of intelligent technology and communication media, which has not only greatly changed the production style and dissemination mode of information, but also profoundly affected human thinking logic and values. Intelligent communication provides strong support and broad space for influencing cognition, dominating cognition and subverting cognition, and is triggering iterative upgrading and profound changes in the cognitive domain. It is of great significance to clarify the mechanism and means of intelligent communication in cognitive attack and defense, so as to innovate cognitive domain combat tactics with the help of intelligent communication. Characteristics of Intelligent Communication in Cognitive Domain Intelligent communication is an activity that applies technologies such as big data, cloud computing, machine learning, and virtual reality to information production and dissemination. Intelligent communication can continuously shape and deeply induce the value orientation and behavioral discernment of the target object, and it has increasingly become a brand-new platform and important field for cognitive attack and defense. Everything is universally interconnected. With the development and evolution of intelligent communication, people and people, people and things, and things and things will be connected, and any intelligent terminal can become a tool for users to receive information and a channel for platforms to put content, and the pushing ability is more powerful and the distribution scene is more extensive. As a result, the role of communication platforms is no longer pure information output, and their ability to shape communication content and even people's thinking, behavior and relationships will become more and more prominent. Intelligent communication can deeply intervene in and promote interpersonal communication, data interaction and information exchange, invariably making the cognitive domain combat space, the type of forces involved in the war has been greatly expanded, and at the same time also realizes the all-round manipulation of the public's thinking and cognition, and production and communication. The continuous evolution of ""ubiquitous interconnection of all things"" has made it possible for all objects to become tools for information dissemination, and information is no longer subject to the limitations of the dimensional domain, so that the subject of cognitive confrontation is ubiquitous and the space is widely expanded. Mixture of reality and fiction. Under the multifaceted communication pattern empowered by intelligent technology, whether in the form of text, pictures, sounds, images and other products, they can easily be forged and widely spread. With the iterative evolution of in-depth forgery technology, the content produced can be presented to the general audience in a form infinitely close to the real one, which can easily influence the public's attitude toward a certain issue, event, or object. At the same time, social robots driven by codes and algorithms can carry out ""spamming"" by extracting key information, liking and forwarding comments, etc., so as to continuously proliferate fake situations and information to confuse public opinion, aggravate the public's irrational and emotional reaction to information, and then manipulate the direction of cognition. Information dissemination is a mixture of truth and falsehood, which can easily lead to the tearing of group trust and make the situation of cognitive attack and defense more complicated and difficult to control. Two-way human-machine interaction. Intelligent media not only enriches the way of information input and output, but also increasingly blurs the original clear boundaries between human and media. Not only can they simply carry out user commands, but they can also give more feedback based on the communication effect. In the long run, the public may subconsciously regard it as an external ""brain"" and be unconsciously influenced by it. With the support of technology, intelligent media can also acquire human-like perception, arithmetic and even emotional intelligence, influencing the user's way of thinking with the help of human-computer interaction, and shaping the user's behavioral orientation through algorithmic recommendations. Under the intelligent communication environment, human beings continuously ""absorb"" information to become an extension of the media, and the media gradually becomes a ""subjectively active human being"". Both human and machine realize cyclic alternation and instant interaction, which makes the cognitive attack and defense present the characteristics of uninterrupted and normalization. The Mechanism of Cognitive Domain of Intelligent Communication Currently, intelligent communication has become an effective means to dominate information content and control public opinion, and with the help of all-round and multi-sensory media system, it mobilizes the immersion experience and subjective consciousness of the target audience from shallow to deep, thus deepening their perception, broadening their cognitive scope and influencing their value choices, and it gradually becomes an important way of ideological infiltration and implementation of attacking and capturing the will of the people. Cognitive influence is exerted through contextual immersion. According to psychological theory, the audience's body and its interaction with the environment play a key role in cognitive activities. As an artificial sensing system outside the human body, the evolving media technology can change or even reshape the way of perception. Intelligent media can superimpose and merge or simulate complex information that cannot appear in the same space and time at the same time, so as to restore the original appearance of the information to the greatest extent possible, and provide the public with immersive sensory experiences such as visual, auditory and tactile sensations. In this way, the communication effect increasingly presents an immersive trend, and intelligent communication makes the information hit the target audience's sensory channels in a more three-dimensional, spatial-temporal and shocking way, thus giving rise to a series of chain reactions, such as ""sensory touch - psychological touch - emotional resonance"", to realize a series of chain reactions. This will lead to a series of chain reactions of ""sensory touch - psychological touch - emotional resonance"", so as to realize the influence and manipulation on the physiological level of their perceptions. Influence the cognitive direction through virtual mapping. The development and popularization of smart devices have increased the ""quantifiability"" and ""traceability"" of human beings. Some of these devices exist in the external environment, but in the future they will increasingly form an inseparable relationship with the human body. Thanks to this, it is possible to map the behavior, activities, and physical state of the audience in multiple dimensions in the virtual world. Once people can experience the cognitive process and its environment through ""virtual entities"", the relationship between the cognitive domain and the cognitive context will no longer be separated into two dimensions: virtual and real. In this process, as an audience, they are both empowered, i.e., obtaining new perceptual experiences and realizing the free extension of cognitive activities; and at the same time, they are also constrained, i.e., the digitally mapped individuals are more vulnerable to insights and manipulation by others. Enhanced cognitive interventions using human-robot fusion. Currently, social robots can shape a human-like communication object by capturing users' emotional dynamics and analyzing the content and structure of the information, promoting the communication subject to shift from ""human"" to ""human-machine symbiosis"". Based on user identity and real-time interaction, social robots can, to a certain extent, influence the public's thinking habits and behavioral patterns, and have significant effects in disseminating false information, manipulating public opinion, carrying out social mobilization, and inciting public emotions. With the continuous improvement of technology, the image of social robots will be richer and more textured, and can even imitate human emotions. Some time ago, ChatGPT based on generative AI, which generates data, information, etc., is more likely to be trusted and accepted by users, and its influence on thinking and cognition is more direct and effective, which can change the user's consciousness subconsciously, and construct the user's cognitive framework covertly and continuously. Intelligent Communication as a Means of Cognitive Domain Intelligent communication is capable of shaping the relationship between users and information in an all-dimensional, all-time, all-domain way, making it more convenient to guide public opinion, shape perceptions, and guide and control behaviors, and is increasingly becoming a ""brain-control weapon"", and gradually developing a whole set of cognitive manipulation practices. Create information fog and attack cognitive black holes. Under the intelligent communication environment, deeply falsified information confuses the boundaries of existence and nothingness, reality and virtual reality, and memory and forgetfulness, and can be used to distort the truth and sway the flow of public opinion, thus achieving the purpose of influencing the direction of cognition and reinforcing cognitive intervention. In particular, intelligent programs represented by social robots have the ability of automatic recognition, intelligent response and even brain-like thinking, and are tireless and ceaseless, capable of bombarding the public with information in a large-scale, multi-channel, high-speed and strong-frequency manner, forming a high-intensity cognitive oppression. Once false opinions or fake events form the public opinion environment, it will greatly compress the individual reaction time, the audience is not only difficult to think in depth, but also easy to be driven by the herd mentality, from not believing to believing, from not accepting to accepting, from not agreeing to agreeing to the qualitative change, and then create a false collective identity, and introduce the target object into the pre-set issue traps. Implementing targeted attack, building cognitive cocoon. In the era of informatization and intelligence, the public's cognition of things is potentially affected by the ubiquitous push information of all kinds. Foreign troops believe that by mastering the Internet traces, shopping records and social status of the target audience, they can quickly collect cognitive data of different dimensions, levels and modalities, providing support for efficiently grasping their values and public opinion positions. On the basis of accurate cognitive mapping, the doubts, weaknesses and needs of the target audience's cognitive system can be discovered, and the content theme, narrative mode and discourse framework can be set according to their thinking preferences. Following this, groups with similar understanding contexts and the same emotional qualities are selected, or specific individuals who are susceptible to influence and have a greater value of influence are selected, and relevant information is delivered in a differentiated and diversified manner through selective recommendation and targeted filtering. With the help of targeted delivery of content and precise attack of channels, we can carry out targeted attack and continuous influence on the target objects, effectively solidify their information acceptance scope, continuously weaken their independent thinking ability, cause them to fall into the cognitive cocoon and stereotypes, and even forcefully change their decision-making intention and action deployment. Penetrate the psychological cracks and break down the emotional dike. Unlike previous means of communication, intelligent communication can build an immersive virtual environment, which expands the user's sensory space and sensory dimension, but also naturally comes with strong sensory stimulation and perceptual cognitive bias, which wears down the user's rational cognitive level and value judgment ability. When the audience perceives the truth of the event, they will be more subject to the influence of sensibility, and in order to pry the cognition, it is especially necessary to rely on the sensibility of the fight. Or attract people with splendid landscape, or tempt people with entertainment scenes, or deter people with horror scenes, with the help of touchable, sensible and interactive intelligent communication to create a very deceptive, confusing and inciting information scenes, which strongly stimulate the psychological feelings of users and make them fall into it without realizing it. Once caught in the emotional infiltration and scene immersion, they can make use of common emotions and common values to incite emotions or moral hostage, destroy their emotional dependence, destroy their value support, and then shock, occupy or even polarize the mind of the target object. (Author's unit: National Defense University National Security Academy)","The article highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the field of cognitive warfare in the age of intelligent communication. With the development of intelligent media and platform technology, human beings are increasingly becoming extensions of the media and are subject to influence by technology-enabled communication. This has led to the normalization and continuity of cognitive attack and defense, creating opportunities for influence, shaping perceptions, and controlling behaviors. The article discusses the mechanisms and means of intelligent communication in cognitive warfare, including its ability to create a ""brain-control weapon"" and develop a complete set of cognitive manipulation practices. The article also discusses how the use of intelligent communication can influence the public's thinking, perceptions, and behaviors, as well as how it can create false collective identities and trap people in pre-set issue traps.

越是领导干部，越要主动靠前服务 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：徐庆东 责任编辑：王韵 2023-04-18 06:40:06 0,做深做实服务工作 ■徐庆东 ●越是领导干部，越要主动靠前服务，这是我们党的优良传统和一贯要求 “什么叫领导，领导就是服务。”一语道出了领导职责的关键所在。越是领导干部，越要主动靠前服务，这是我们党的优良传统和一贯要求。领导干部须深刻认识到这一点，自觉端正权力观、政绩观、事业观，不断在深入一线、改进作风、强化服务中提高领导工作质效。 服务反映根本态度。愿不愿意放下架子、俯下身子做好服务工作，表面看是领导作风问题，实则反映的是能不能践行党的性质宗旨的根本态度问题。我们党坚持全心全意为人民服务，在任何时候都把群众利益放在第一位，把人民放在最高的位置。当前，随着作风建设的持续推进，部队各级领导机关和领导干部服务意识不断强化，但个别领导干部脱离群众、高高在上的问题仍然存在，这不仅做不好领导工作，更是背离了我党我军的性质宗旨。作为部队各级领导干部，必须自觉用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想武装头脑，深刻认清领导工作的本质不是发号施令，更不是以上压下，而是全心全意为人民服务，永远牢记自己的第一身份是共产党员，第一职责是为党工作，切实端正对待官兵的态度，激发官兵主人翁意识，推动部队建设发展和战斗力提升。 服务关乎军心士气。真心实意服务好、保障好官兵，才能最大限度凝聚官兵，提振士气，汇聚起战胜一切困难的坚强意志。“卫国戍边英雄团长”祁发宝所在团有个不成文的规定：对峙时干部站前头、战士站后头，吃饭时战士不打满、干部不端碗，野营时战士睡里头、干部睡风口。没有真心实意的服务保障，哪有冲锋陷阵的英勇无畏。从基层情况看，官兵反映的矛盾困难大多是一些“小事”，但如果单位领导服务意识不强，对这些所谓的“小事”漠不关心，就容易导致怨气滋生、士气不振，进而会影响甚至危及部队凝聚力战斗力这个“大事”。实践反复证明，领导干部只有真正以基层反映的困难疾苦为镜，主动作为，解决好官兵急需急盼的困难问题，才能汇聚起平时攻坚克难抓建设、战时齐心协力斗强敌的高昂军心士气。 服务决定建设成败。官兵是部队建设的主体，领导干部能不能把服务基层做到位，激发官兵潜能，凝聚集体智慧，关系部队建设的成败。“积力之所举，则无不胜也；众智之所为，则无不成也。”在我军的历史上，“王克勤运动”“郭兴福教学法”等，无不发端于一线官兵的聪明才智，在一定时期内有力推动了部队训练水平的提升和作战能力的提高。然而，广大官兵的主观能动性、创新创造能力不会凭空产生。作为领导干部，一定要树牢依靠官兵抓建设的理念，注重把功夫下在帮助官兵学习成才、参与建设、大胆创新上，着力健全完善激发活力、鼓励创新的有效机制，积极为官兵发挥智慧才能搭建平台，切实在服务官兵、依靠官兵中提升部队建设发展质效。 服务体现领导能力。领导工作的重点在于破解矛盾问题，打通建设发展堵点。领导干部做好服务工作，不能简单地理解为办好暖心惠兵的实事好事，更重要的是要围绕服务破解难题。能不能做好这个服务工作，直接关系领导工作的成效，也体现领导干部的综合能力。比如，如果对当前的形势特点研究不深，对部队建设发展的难点堵点摸得不准，对官兵的所思所想知之不多，提的对策、作的决策就难以契合基层实际，甚至南辕北辙，做了无用功。因此，领导干部要做好服务工作，必须持之以恒提升领导能力、改进领导作风，深入一线调查摸清实情，开动脑筋分析判断情况，群策群力研究对策措施，不断提高服务官兵、服务建设的能力水平。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230419002831/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16217991.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230418072558/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16217991.html,2023-04-19 0:00:00,"The more the leading cadres, the more they should take the initiative to lean forward to serve Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Xu Qingdong Editor-in-Chief: Wang Yun 2023-04-18 06:40:06 0","Do deep and practical service work ■ Xu Qingdong ● the more leading cadres, the more initiative to lean forward to serve, which is our party's fine tradition and consistent requirements ""What do you mean by leadership, leadership is service."" The key to the duties of leadership is stated in a single sentence. The more leading cadres, the more initiative to front service, which is our party's fine tradition and consistent requirements. Leading cadres must deeply realize this, consciously correct the concept of power, the concept of performance, the concept of career, and constantly in the depth of the front line, improve style, strengthen the service to improve the quality of leadership work. Service reflects the fundamental attitude. Willing to put down the shelf, bend down to do a good job of service work, on the surface is the problem of leadership style, in fact, reflects the fundamental attitude of the ability to practice the nature of the party's purpose. Our party insists on serving the people wholeheartedly, at all times put the interests of the masses in the first place, put the people in the highest position. At present, with the continued promotion of style construction, the troops at all levels of leading organs and leading cadres to strengthen the sense of service, but individual leading cadres detached from the masses, the problem still exists, which not only do not do a good job of leading the work, but also deviated from the nature of the Party's purpose of our army. As leading cadres at all levels of the army, we must consciously arm our minds with Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and deeply recognize that the essence of leadership is not to give orders, not to mention the superiority of the subordinate, but to serve the people wholeheartedly, always remembering that their first identity is a member of the Communist Party, and their first duty is to work for the Party, and to effectively rectify the attitude towards the officers and soldiers, to stimulate the sense of mastery of the soldiers and the officers and to promote the construction of the army and the development and enhancement of combat effectiveness. Development and combat effectiveness. Service is a matter of military morale. Sincerely serve and protect the officers and soldiers, in order to maximize the cohesion of the officers and soldiers, boost morale, and bring together the strong will to overcome all difficulties. ""Defending the country garrison hero head"" QiFaBao regiment has an unwritten rules: confrontation cadres stand in front of the warrior stand behind the head, when eating warriors do not play full, cadres do not serve bowl, camping warriors sleep in the head, cadres sleep in the wind. There is no sincere service guarantee, which has the courage to charge into battle. From the grass-roots situation, officers and soldiers reflect the contradictions and difficulties are mostly some ""small things"", but if the unit leaders do not have a strong sense of service, these so-called ""small things"" indifference, it is easy to lead to resentment, morale is not vibrant, which will affect or even jeopardize the troops! The cohesion and combat effectiveness of this ""big thing"". Practice has repeatedly proved that the leading cadres only really to grass-roots difficulties reflected in the mirror, take the initiative as a solution to the urgent needs of officers and soldiers of the difficult problem, in order to bring together the usual difficulties to grasp the construction, wartime concerted efforts to fight the enemy's high military morale. Service determines the success or failure of construction. Officers and soldiers is the main body of the construction of troops, leading cadres can not put the service to the grassroots level, to stimulate the potential of officers and soldiers, cohesion of collective wisdom, the relationship between the success or failure of the construction of troops. ""The cumulative strength of the lift, there is no victory; the wisdom of the crowd, there is no success."" In the history of our army, ""Wang Keqin movement"", ""Guo Xingfu teaching method"", etc., all began in the front-line officers and soldiers of the wisdom, in a certain period of time to promote the level of training and combat capability of the troops to improve. However, the majority of officers and soldiers of the subjective initiative, innovation and creativity will not come out of thin air. As a leading cadres, we must firmly rely on officers and soldiers to grasp the concept of construction, focusing on the efforts to help officers and soldiers to learn to become successful, participate in construction, bold innovation, efforts to improve the effective mechanism to stimulate vitality and encourage innovation, and actively for the officers and soldiers to give full play to their wisdom and talent to build a platform, and effectively in the service of the officers and soldiers, relying on the officers and soldiers in the enhancement of the quality of the development of the construction of the force. Service reflects leadership. The focus of the leadership work is to crack the contradictions and problems, through the construction and development of the blockage. Leading cadres to do a good job of service work, can not simply be understood as a good warm-hearted favor soldiers of good things, more importantly, to crack the problem around the service. Can do a good job of this service work, directly related to the effectiveness of the leadership work, but also reflects the comprehensive ability of leading cadres. For example, if the current situation is not characterized by a deep study, the development of the construction of the army is not allowed to feel the difficulties of the blocking point, not much knowledge of the thoughts of the officers and soldiers, proposed countermeasures, decision-making will be difficult to fit the grass-roots level of the actual situation, and even the opposite direction, doing useless work. Therefore, leading cadres to do a good job of service, we must consistently improve leadership ability, improve leadership style, in-depth investigation of the front line to find out the real situation, analyze and judge the situation, the group research countermeasures, and constantly improve the ability to serve the officers and soldiers, service construction level.","The article emphasizes the importance of leading cadres taking the initiative to serve and serve the frontline to reflect the fundamental attitude of the army and build up good relations with the soldiers.

大兴调查研究之风系列谈丨以系统观念抓调研 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：陈鑫 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-17 07:10:05 0,以系统观念抓调研 ■陈 鑫 中共中央办公厅印发的《关于在全党大兴调查研究的工作方案》强调：“必须坚持系统观念，深入实际、深入基层、深入群众调查了解情况，把握好全局和局部、当前和长远、宏观和微观、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、特殊和一般的关系，前瞻性思考、全局性谋划、整体性推进党和国家各项事业。”这一要求，不仅明确了调查研究和系统观念之间的密切联系和辩证关系，更为全党大兴调查研究提供了科学方法指导。 不谋万世者，不足谋一时；不谋全局者，不足谋一域。系统观念是具有基础性的思想和工作方法。从系统观念出发，用普遍联系的、全面系统的、发展变化的观点观察事物、调研问题，才能把握客观规律、认清问题本质。中国共产党自成立以来，始终注重运用系统观念来认识世界和改造世界，善于运用系统思维洞悉时势、总揽全局，并将其作为党员干部提升调查研究能力、增强调查研究实效的内在要求加以强调。当前，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，不确定、难预料因素增多，国内改革发展稳定任务面临不少深层次矛盾躲不开、绕不过，各种风险挑战、困难问题比以往更加严峻复杂。调查研究要真正把握事物的本质和规律，找到破解难题的办法和路径，就必须遵循唯物辩证法的方法要求、汲取百年党史的宝贵经验，始终坚持系统观念，持续在前瞻性思考、全局性谋划、整体性推进上下功夫，不断增强调查研究的科学性、系统性、实效性。 要仰望星空、放眼未来，注重前瞻性思考。“明者远见于未萌，而智者避危于无形。”早在中国革命初期，毛泽东同志就在调查研究的基础上，既客观分析了国内政治形势和敌我力量对比，又前瞻性地指明中国革命高潮“是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿”，科学预见了革命形势发展走向。新征程大兴调查研究，既是聚焦现实问题的有力举措，也是谋划未来的长远工程，必须在立足现实的基础上放眼未来，注重加强前瞻性思考，善于在调查研究中通过现实看问题、透过现象看本质，坚持运用全面、辩证、长远的眼光，分清机遇和挑战，未雨绸缪、系统谋划，切实在科学研判历史大势、准确把握时代浪潮的基础上，下好先手棋、打好主动仗，不断提升调查研究的时代前瞻性，为推进党和国家各项事业发展提供助力。 要登高望远、胸怀大局，注重全局性谋划。“得其大者可以兼其小。”全局性谋划，就是强调要从大局、全局出发对调查研究进行综合考量和系统谋划，自觉做到认清大局、看透大局、服务大局、贡献大局。历史和实践反复证明，抓全局有高度、有方向，抓局部就会有目标、有秩序，各项工作就能统成一盘棋、拧成一股绳，反之则往往顾此失彼、进退失据，陷入捡了芝麻丢西瓜、补了东墙短西墙的困境之中。习主席强调，“必须牢固树立高度自觉的大局意识”，要求“把工作放到大局中去思考、定位、摆布，做到正确认识大局、自觉服从大局、坚决维护大局”。新征程大兴调查研究，必须把调查研究涉及的各类具体工作、具体问题放到大局中去谋划、去解决，把握好全局和局部、当前和长远、宏观和微观、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、特殊和一般的关系，强化“一盘棋”思维，以“一子落”带动“全盘活”，实现“立足全局谋一域、干好一域促全局”。 要弹好钢琴、统筹兼顾，注重整体性推进。唯物辩证法认为，事物是普遍联系的，事物及事物各要素相互影响、相互制约。坚持唯物辩证法，就要做到整体性与协调性的统一，实现“十指协奏”。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央始终坚持以系统观念举旗定向、谋篇布局，善于从整体层面思考把握治国理政问题，统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局，协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，对新时代各项工作起到了纲举目张、引领方向的作用。新征程大兴调查研究，同样离不开整体思维，要深刻认识到全面建设社会主义现代化国家是一个庞大的系统工程，明晰其中各个领域、各项工作的关联性和互动性，既避免调研分析中的“盲人摸象”，又避免调研决策中的“畸轻畸重”，做到“十个指头都动作”，努力在统筹兼顾中实现协调发展，在综合平衡中提升整体效能，真正使各项工作相辅相成、相得益彰，推动党和国家事业不断迈上新台阶。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230419002831/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16217518.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230417010836/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16217518.html,2023-04-19 0:00:00,Daxing the wind of investigation and research series talk丨to grasp the research with a systematic concept Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Chen Xin Editor in Chief: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-17 07:10:05 0,"To grasp the research with a systematic concept ■ Chen Xin The General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued a ""work program on the party-wide survey and research"" emphasized: ""must adhere to the systematic concept, in-depth practical, in-depth grassroots, in-depth investigation of the masses to understand the situation, to grasp the overall situation and the local, the current and the long term, macroscopic and microscopic, the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, the special and the general relationship between the forward-looking thinking , global planning, and holistic promotion of the Party and the country's various undertakings."" This requirement not only clarifies the close connection and dialectical relationship between investigation and research and systematic conception, but also provides scientific methodological guidance for the whole party to conduct investigation and research. Those who do not plan for the whole world are not enough to plan for a time; those who do not plan for the whole situation are not enough to plan for a region. The system concept is a fundamental method of thinking and working. From the system concept, with the universal connection, comprehensive and systematic, development and change of the point of view to observe things, research problems, in order to grasp the objective law, recognize the essence of the problem. Since its inception, the Communist Party of China has always focused on the use of the system concept to understand the world and transform the world, good use of systematic thinking to understand the current situation, the overall situation, and as party cadres to enhance the ability to enhance the effectiveness of investigation and research to emphasize the inherent requirements of investigation and research. At present, the world's unprecedented situation is accelerating, uncertainty, unpredictable factors increase, domestic reform, development and stabilization of the task is faced with a number of deep-rooted contradictions can not hide, can not be avoided, all kinds of risks and challenges, difficulties and problems are more serious and complex than ever before. Investigation and research to truly grasp the essence and laws of things, to find ways to crack the problem and path, we must follow the methodological requirements of material dialectics, draw on the valuable experience of a century of party history, always adhere to the systematic concept, continue to think forward, global planning, holistic efforts to promote, and constantly enhance the scientific, systematic and effective investigation and research. To look up to the stars, look to the future, focusing on forward-looking thinking. ""The wise man sees far ahead, and the wise man avoids danger in the invisible."" As early as the early days of the Chinese revolution, comrade Mao Zedong on the basis of investigation and research, both objective analysis of the domestic political situation and the enemy's strength, and forward-looking pointed out that the climax of the Chinese revolution ""is standing on the shore of the sea has been seen in the tip of the mast of a sailing ship, it is standing on the top of the mountain to see the east has seen the radiance of a round of the morning sun, it is restless in the mother's belly is about to ripen. It is a baby about to mature in the mother's womb"", scientifically foreseeing the direction of the development of the revolutionary situation. The new journey of investigation and research, not only focus on the reality of the strong initiative, but also planning for the future of the long-term project, we must be based on the reality of the future on the basis of focusing on the strengthening of forward-looking thinking, good at investigating and researching through the reality of the problem, through the phenomenon of the essence of the adherence to the use of a comprehensive, dialectical, long-term vision, to distinguish between the opportunities and challenges, prepare for a rainy day, systematic planning, and effectively in the scientific study of the historical trend, accurately grasp the wave of the times. On the basis of scientific study of the historical trend, accurately grasp the wave of the times, play a good first move, play a good initiative, and constantly improve the era of forward-looking investigation and research, to promote the development of the Party and the country's various undertakings to provide assistance. To look far ahead, the big picture, focusing on the overall planning. ""The one who gets the big one can get the small one."" Global planning, is to emphasize the need to start from the big picture, the whole situation on the investigation and research for comprehensive consideration and systematic planning, consciously do recognize the big picture, see through the big picture, service the big picture, contribute to the big picture. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the overall situation has a high degree of height, there is a direction, grasp the local will have a goal, there is order, the work can be unified into a chess, twisted into a rope, and vice versa, often lose sight of the other side of the coin, in and out, into the pick up the sesame and lose the watermelon, mending the east wall short of the west wall of the predicament. President Xi emphasized that ""must firmly establish a high degree of consciousness of the overall situation"", requiring ""the work into the overall situation to think, positioning, layout, to achieve a correct understanding of the overall situation, consciously obey the overall situation, resolutely safeguard the overall situation"". The new journey of investigation and research, we must put the investigation and research involved in various types of specific work, specific issues into the overall situation to plan, to solve, grasp the overall situation and local, current and long-term, macro and micro, major and minor contradictions, special and general relationship, strengthen the ""chess"" thinking, in order to ""a child fall"". ""A child fall"" to drive ""the whole plate live"", to achieve ""based on the overall planning a region, do a good job a region to promote the overall situation. To play a good piano, take into account the overall situation, focusing on holistic promotion. Material dialectics believes that things are universally linked, things and the elements of things interact with each other, mutual constraints. Adhere to the material dialectic, we must achieve the unity of wholeness and coordination, to realize the ""ten fingers concerto"". Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always adhered to the systematic concept of raising the flag, planning and layout, and is good at thinking and grasping the issues of governance from the overall level, promoting the overall layout of the ""five-in-one"" and coordinating the promotion of the ""four-comprehensive"" strategic layout, which is the most effective way to promote the new era of governance. The ""five-in-one"" overall layout, coordinated to promote the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout, the work of the new era has played the role of the outline, leading the direction of the role. The new journey of investigation and research, also inseparable from the overall thinking, to deeply understand that the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country is a huge systematic project, clear which the various fields, the work of the correlation and interactivity, not only to avoid research and analysis of the ""blind man feeling the elephant"", but also to avoid the research and decision-making in the To avoid both the research and analysis of ""blind men feeling the elephant"", and to avoid the research and decision-making in the ""abnormally light and heavy"", to do ""ten fingers are action"", and strive to achieve coordinated development in a comprehensive and balanced, comprehensive and balanced to enhance the overall effectiveness of the work, and truly make the work complementary, complementary, and promote the cause of the Party and the country continue to move forward to a new level. (Author's unit: School of Political Science, National Defense University)","The General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued a work program on the party-wide survey and research that emphasized the need to grasp the situation with a systematic concept. The system concept is a fundamental method of thinking and working, which helps to understand the objective law, recognize the essence of the problem, and find ways to crack the problem and path. In today's rapidly changing world, investigation and research must follow the methodological requirements of material dialectics, draw on valuable experience of a century of party history, and always adhere to the system concept to enhance the effectiveness of investigation and research. The system concept also requires us to focus on forward-thinking, global planning, and holistic efforts to promote, and constantly enhance the scientific, systematic, and effective investigation and research.

准确把握有人/无人协同作战平衡点 叩开无人作战制胜之门 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：赵先刚　吕聪 责任编辑：刘秋丽 2023-04-20 07:26:44 0,●准确把握有人/无人协同作战的平衡点—— 叩开无人作战制胜之门 ■赵先刚　吕　聪 引 言 有人/无人协同作战是当前作战领域发展的一个重要概念，其目标是实现有人与无人系统混合编组，最大限度发挥二者互补增效优势，以提高整体作战能力。应该看到，作为一种新型兵力组合运用方式或协同作战模式，有人/无人协同作战还处于发展过程中，无论从思维认识层面，还是从能力生成角度，都需要找到一个最佳平衡点，才能真正实现其合理发展和高效运用。 适配：无人平台性能与有人平台能力的平衡 有人/无人协同作战的目标是，实现多个不同类型的有人与无人作战平台共同编组、同步行动，在进行作战功能互补搭配的同时，各作战平台在作战性能和战场环境适应能力上应该能够满足共同编组作战的需要，否则将难以建立起紧密的作战编队。当前，由于各类无人作战平台正处在不断发展阶段，无论平台基础性能，还是作战功能都相对比较弱，与快节奏、强对抗的战场环境还不相适应。加之无人系统自成体系发展，在技术标准和性能上都难以与同类型的有人作战平台共同编组作战，需要考虑如何与平台的整体作战能力相适应。 一方面，要使无人作战平台在基础性能上与有人作战平台相适应，能够与有人作战平台相匹配，以便更高效地进行协同配合。比如，地面无人战车不但要在机动速度上与陆上各类有人驾驶战斗车辆相匹配，还应具备与任务环境相匹配的地形适应能力；各类无人机除了保持航时、航程优势外，还应具有与不同类型有人驾驶飞机相近的飞行性能，特别是飞行速度、高度、机动过载等。同时，在武器载荷及其性能上也要适应协同作战需要，确保能够作为有力的“伙伴”和延伸的“臂膀”，与有人作战平台形成强强组合，发挥有人/无人协同作战编队整体作战效能。 另一方面，要使无人作战平台在自主性上与有人作战平台相适应，能够根据执行任务设定的初始与终止状态及过程约束条件，自动保持编队机动与作战队形、自动规避威胁，相对自主地执行有人作战平台下达的任务指令，以形成紧密的协同配合。目前，无人作战平台智能化程度较低，自主性不高，在面对激烈对抗环境下的高复杂性、强动态性和不确定性时，如果完全依靠编队内有人作战平台上人员的控制，将很难适应快速变化的战场实际，形成有效协同配合效果。这就需要根据不同的协同作战等级和协同作战编组类型，提升无人作战平台与有人作战平台协同作战相适应的自主能力。 因此，发展有人/无人协同作战，应根据不同作战场景下协同作战的指挥控制体系架构，通过对在役有人与无人作战平台进行智能化改造升级或者重新研制，增强有人与无人作战平台之间的适配性，形成更加紧密和有效配合的协同作战能力。 适度：人工干预程度与智能系统辅助的平衡 有人/无人协同作战的重要特征是，参与共同编组作战的有人平台与无人平台之间实现信息直接交互，并在编队内有人作战平台统一规划控制下协同配合作战。信息化智能化战场形势瞬息万变，负责编队指挥的有人作战平台人员在操控自身平台的同时，还要根据战场态势及时、准确地调整并最终确定编队作战方案、规划分配任务，以及对行动中的偏差及时调控，是一项复杂、繁重和时效性极强的工作。如果这一系列活动完全由人工完成，不仅增加了人的生理、心理压力和认知负荷，还可能因此导致编队协同失调、行动失序、任务失败。这就需要一套智能辅助决策与控制系统嵌入有人作战平台，辅助完成编队态势感知、任务规划和行动控制等任务，并能够根据战场态势变化在有人平台与无人平台之间进行任务权重的动态分配，从而提高有人/无人协同作战编队决策与行动效率。 一方面，应通过智能辅助决策系统，快速处理战场态势信息、预测态势变化与评估威胁，并基于智能推理机制自动生成针对性的行动计划。根据战场威胁变化进行在线实时任务重新规划，为编队战术行动提供决策建议，辅助有人/无人协同作战编队指挥员作出决策、管理战术执行以及控制引导各作战平台行动。在指挥员与智能系统之间进行合理的任务分工，实现人与计算机的优势互补，不仅可以大大提升编队在动态不确定战场环境下执行任务的时效性，还可最大限度地降低编队指挥员的工作负荷，使其能够集中精力于编队作战的高层次决策和关键事件确认。 另一方面，应借助智能控制系统，准确识别有人/无人协同作战编队指挥员的指令意图，将指挥员的意图转化为无人作战平台能够识别的任务指令，同时能够按需分发至相应的无人作战平台，减少人-机交互过程中指挥员的负担，从而提高交互效率和编队内无人作战平台的控制能力。如外军发展的“无人机控制最佳角色分配管理控制系统”，将人-机互动、自主性和认知科学领域的最新技术融合到一套作战系统中，通过智能无人机自主行为软件和高级交互界面，可使空中任务指挥官同时管理多架无人机，并在任务达到关键决策节点时通知任务指挥官确认，能够在不增加其工作负荷的情况下，提高有人/无人机协同态势感知能力和执行任务效果。 因此，提高有人/无人协同作战能力，应借助智能化作战管理系统，找准人工干预与系统辅助之间在任务分配上的平衡，使智能系统承担部分甚至大部分需要快速反应的繁琐、重复的计算任务，使编队指挥员专注于更复杂的、更需要人工作出灵活决策的任务和关键性行动。 适需：协同模式运用与实际作战需要的平衡 有人/无人协同作战是一种区别于传统协同的新型协同作战模式。按照有人/无人协同作战编组内有人作战力量与无人系统的互操作水平，从有人作战力量角度，可分为“直接从无人作战平台传感器获取信息数据”“具备对无人作战平台载荷的适时控制”“具备对无人作战平台载荷及行动的控制”三个等级，协同的紧密程度逐渐提高。当前，在传统与新型协同作战模式并存、新型协同作战模式中多种协同等级并存的情况下，需要从作战效果出发，根据实际作战需要，选择相应的协同作战模式或协同等级。 一方面，应基于实际作战效果，合理选择协同作战模式。有人/无人协同作战，具有信息交互直接、协调配合紧密等特点，但并不适用于所有有人作战力量与无人系统，不能为了有人/无人协同作战而去协同，有时为确保作战效果，仍须采取传统的协同作战模式，即按照任务计划，在预定时间进入相应战场相对独立地遂行任务。比如，地面防空预警探测力量与侦察预警无人机，虽然是相互配合遂行预警探测任务，但通常不会将无人机获取的信息直接传输至地面预警探测力量，因为这将增加地面预警雷达部队同时处理本专业领域情报和无人机回传情报的负担，无法专注于雷达空情分析判断，反而不如由操控站对无人机实施控制，并对侦察预警情报进行预处理后再传至联合防空作战信息情报中心，由其进行多元融合处理更高效。 另一方面，应根据实际作战任务，灵活选用协同作战等级。有人/无人协同作战的三个等级，并不是级别越高越好，而是要针对不同的有人与无人系统类型，结合不同的任务场景和作战时机灵活选择运用，才能最大限度地发挥作战效能。比如，远程侦察监视无人机协同陆上中远程火力打击单元实施对地打击时，只需要实现火力打击单元与无人机之间的直接通信联通和信息交互，能够无中间环节地直接利用无人机获取的战场信息，即可很好地满足打击决策、火力规划、目标引导和毁伤评估等作战需求，而不必要求对无人机进行飞行控制，无人机的机动飞行仍由后方操控站负责，则是效能发挥的最佳协同等级。如果将无人机的载荷控制甚至是飞行控制权交由火力打击单元，反而会增加额外的工作负担，使其不能更加专注于本专业领域任务的完成，不仅不会增效，反而可能降效。 因此，组织有人/无人协同作战，应以遂行共同任务为基本遵循，以能够达成互补增效为根本目的，根据有人作战力量类型和实际作战需要及共同编组的可能性，合理匹配无人系统，灵活采用最适合的协同作战模式和协同作战等级。 （作者单位：国防大学联合作战学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230422000349/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16218463.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230420020005/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16218463.html,2023-04-22 0:00:00,Accurately Grasp the Balance of Manned/Unmanned Co-operation Knocking on the Door of Victory in Unmanned Combat Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zhao Xiangang Lv Cong Editor-in-Chief: Liu Qiuli 2023-04-20 07:26:44 0,"Accurately Grasp the Balance Point of Manned/Unmanned Co-operation - Knocking on the Door of Winning Unmanned Combat ■ Zhao Xiangang, Lv Cong Introduction Manned/Unmanned Co-operation is an important concept in the development of the current combat field, and its goal is to realize the hybridization of manned and unmanned systems and maximize their complementary and synergistic advantages, so as to improve the overall combat capability. The goal is to maximize the complementary advantages of the two, so as to improve the overall combat capability. It should be seen that, as a new type of force combination or coordinated combat mode, manned/unmanned coordinated combat is still in the process of development, no matter from the level of thinking and understanding, or from the point of view of capability generation, it is necessary to find an optimal balance in order to truly realize its rational development and efficient use. Adaptation: the balance between unmanned platform performance and manned platform capability The goal of manned/unmanned coordinated warfare is to realize a number of different types of manned and unmanned combat platforms to jointly organize and synchronize actions, and at the same time, while carrying out complementary matching of combat functions, the combat platforms should be able to satisfy the needs of jointly organizing the combat in terms of their combat performance and adaptability to battlefield environments, or else it will be difficult to establish a close combat formation. At present, since all kinds of unmanned combat platforms are in the stage of continuous development, no matter the basic performance of the platform, or the combat function is relatively weak, with the fast-paced, strong confrontation battlefield environment is not compatible. In addition, unmanned systems have developed into a system of their own, and it is difficult to organize and fight with manned combat platforms of the same type in terms of technical standards and performance, so it is necessary to consider how to adapt to the overall combat capability of the platform. On the one hand, it is necessary to make the unmanned combat platform compatible with the manned combat platform in terms of basic performance, and be able to match with the manned combat platform in order to carry out synergistic cooperation more efficiently. For example, ground unmanned combat vehicles should not only be matched with various types of manned combat vehicles on land in terms of maneuvering speed, but should also have the ability to adapt to the terrain that matches the mission environment; various types of unmanned aircraft, in addition to maintaining the advantage of airtime and range, should also have flight performance similar to that of different types of manned aircraft, in particular, flight speed, altitude, maneuvering overload, and so on. At the same time, the weapon load and its performance should also be adapted to the needs of coordinated operations, to ensure that it can serve as a powerful ""partner"" and extended ""arm"", forming a strong combination with manned combat platforms, and giving full play to the overall combat effectiveness of manned/unmanned coordinated combat formations. On the other hand, the unmanned combat platform should be compatible with the manned combat platform in terms of autonomy, and be able to automatically maintain formation maneuver and combat formation, automatically avoid threats, and relatively autonomously execute the mission orders given by the manned combat platform according to the initial and termination states and process constraints set by the execution of the mission, so as to form a close coordination. At present, the unmanned combat platform has a low degree of intelligence and low autonomy, and in the face of the high complexity, strong dynamics and uncertainty in the fierce confrontation environment, if it completely relies on the control of the personnel on the manned combat platform within the formation, it will be difficult to adapt to the fast-changing battlefield realities and to form an effective synergistic cooperation effect. This requires the enhancement of the autonomous capability of unmanned combat platforms and manned combat platforms according to different levels of coordinated combat and types of coordinated combat formations. Therefore, the development of manned/unmanned coordinated combat should be based on the command and control system architecture of coordinated combat under different combat scenarios, through intelligent transformation and upgrading or re-development of the in-service manned and unmanned combat platforms, to enhance the adaptability between manned and unmanned combat platforms, and to form a closer and more effective coordination of coordinated combat capabilities. Appropriateness: the balance between the degree of manual intervention and the assistance of intelligent systems An important feature of manned/unmanned coordinated combat is that the manned platforms and unmanned platforms participating in the common formation combat realize direct information interaction, and coordinate and cooperate in combat under the unified planning and control of manned combat platforms within the formation. The situation of the informationized intelligent battlefield changes rapidly, and the personnel of the manned combat platform responsible for formation command have to adjust and finalize the formation combat scheme, plan and assign tasks timely and accurately according to the battlefield situation, as well as timely adjust and control the deviation in the action, which is a complex, heavy and time-sensitive work. If this series of activities is completely completed manually, it not only increases human physiological and psychological pressure and cognitive load, but also may lead to formation synergy dissonance, disordered action and mission failure as a result. This requires a set of intelligent auxiliary decision-making and control systems embedded in manned combat platforms to assist in accomplishing tasks such as formation situational awareness, mission planning and action control, and to be able to dynamically allocate task weights between manned and unmanned platforms according to changes in battlefield situations, thus improving the efficiency of manned/unmanned coordinated combat formation decision-making and actions. On the one hand, the intelligent assisted decision-making system should be used to quickly process battlefield situational information, predict situational changes and assess threats, and automatically generate targeted action plans based on intelligent reasoning mechanisms. On-line real-time mission re-planning is carried out according to changes in battlefield threats, providing decision-making suggestions for formation tactical operations, assisting commanders of manned/unmanned cooperative combat formations in decision-making, managing tactical execution, and controlling and guiding the actions of various combat platforms. Reasonable task division between the commander and the intelligent system to realize the complementary advantages of human and computer can not only greatly enhance the timeliness of the formation's mission execution under the dynamic and uncertain battlefield environment, but also minimize the workload of the formation commander, so that he or she can concentrate on high-level decision-making and confirmation of key events of the formation's operations. On the other hand, with the help of intelligent control system, the commander's instruction intention of manned/unmanned coordinated combat formation should be accurately recognized, and the commander's intention should be transformed into the task instruction that can be recognized by the unmanned combat platform, and at the same time, it can be distributed to the corresponding unmanned combat platform on demand, so that the burden of the commander in the process of human-computer interaction can be reduced, and thus the interaction efficiency and the control capability of the formation's unmanned combat platform can be improved. For example, the ""UAV Control Optimal Role Assignment Management Control System"" developed by foreign armies integrates the latest technologies in the fields of human-computer interaction, autonomy and cognitive science into a set of combat systems, and enables air mission commanders to manage multiple UAVs at the same time by means of intelligent UAV autonomy behavioral software and advanced interactive interfaces and notify mission commanders to confirm the mission orders when the mission reaches a critical decision-making node. Notify the mission commander to confirm when the mission reaches a critical decision node, which can improve the manned/unmanned coordinated situational awareness capability and the effectiveness of executing the mission without increasing their workload. Therefore, to improve the manned/unmanned coordinated operation capability, the balance between manual intervention and system assistance in task distribution should be found with the help of intelligent combat management system, so that the intelligent system will undertake some or even most of the tedious and repetitive calculation tasks that require quick response, so that the formation commander will focus on the more complex tasks and critical operations that require more flexible decision-making from the human workforce. Suitable for the needs: the balance between the use of cooperative mode and the actual operational needs Manned/unmanned cooperative warfare is a new type of cooperative warfare mode that is different from the traditional cooperative. According to the level of interoperability between manned combat forces and unmanned systems within the manned/unmanned coordinated combat group, from the perspective of manned combat forces, it can be categorized into ""obtaining information and data directly from the sensors of unmanned combat platforms"", ""possessing timely control over the payloads of unmanned combat platforms"", ""having the ability to control the loads of unmanned combat platforms"" and ""having the ability to control the loads of unmanned combat platforms"". The level of interoperability can be categorized into ""obtaining information and data directly from the sensors of unmanned combat platforms"", ""having timely control over the payloads of unmanned combat platforms"" and ""having control over the payloads and actions of unmanned combat platforms"". At present, in the case of the coexistence of traditional and new cooperative combat modes and the coexistence of multiple cooperative levels in new cooperative combat modes, it is necessary to select the corresponding cooperative combat mode or cooperative level based on the actual operational needs from the operational effects. On the one hand, it should be based on the actual combat effect, reasonable selection of cooperative combat mode. Manned/unmanned coordinated combat, with direct information interaction, coordination and close cooperation and other characteristics, but does not apply to all manned combat forces and unmanned systems, in order to manned/unmanned coordinated combat to go to the coordinated, and sometimes in order to ensure the combat effect, still have to take the traditional mode of coordinated combat, that is, according to the mission plan, at the predetermined time to enter the corresponding battlefield to carry out the task relatively independently. For example, the ground air defense early warning and detection forces and reconnaissance and early warning UAV, although they are to cooperate with each other to attempt early warning and detection tasks, but usually will not directly transmit the information obtained by the UAV to the ground early warning and detection forces, because this will increase the burden of ground early warning radar forces to deal with the professional field of intelligence and UAV back to the burden of intelligence, can not focus on the radar analysis and judgment of the situation in the air, but rather not as good as by the operator of the control station to the UAV Instead, it is better to control the UAV by the control station and pre-process the reconnaissance and early warning intelligence before transmitting it to the Joint Air Defense Information Intelligence Center, which is more efficient in multi-dimensional fusion processing. On the other hand, the level of coordinated operation should be flexibly selected according to the actual combat mission. The three levels of manned/unmanned coordinated combat are not the higher the better, but should be applied flexibly for different types of manned and unmanned systems, combined with different mission scenarios and combat timing, in order to maximize combat effectiveness. For example, when the long-range reconnaissance and surveillance UAV cooperates with the land-based medium- and long-range fire strike unit to implement the ground strike, it only needs to realize the direct communication link and information interaction between the fire strike unit and the UAV, and can directly use the battlefield information acquired by the UAV without any intermediate link, so that it can satisfy the operational needs of striking decision-making, fire planning, target guiding, and damage assessment without the need to require the UAV to carry out the flight control. Flight control, UAV maneuvering flight is still by the rear control station is responsible for, then the best synergistic level of performance play. If the load control or even flight control of the UAV is handed over to the fire strike unit, it will instead increase the extra workload and prevent it from focusing more on the completion of the tasks in its own specialty area, which will not only not increase the efficiency, but may instead decrease it. Therefore, the organization of manned/unmanned coordinated combat should be based on the basic principle of attempting common tasks, with the fundamental purpose of achieving complementary efficiency, matching unmanned systems reasonably according to the type of manned combat forces and actual operational needs and the possibility of joint formation, and flexibly adopting the most suitable mode of coordinated combat and level of coordinated combat.

The goal determines the direction, and the goal to inspire the motivation. President Xi emphasized at the first meeting of the 14th National People's Congress that the ambitious goals of national construction and national rejuvenation are encouraging and inspiring, and called on us to continuously add bricks and mortar and color to the great cause of national construction and national rejuvenation. Every officer and soldier should actively respond to President Xi's call, consciously engage in the era of struggle for the realization of this goal, anchored in the goal, the sure-footedness of action without slacking off, with unremitting energy and the state of vigor and vigor, and make joint efforts to turn the grand goal into a beautiful reality. ""The ambition of the goal, not far from the sea, the poor mountain from the sea, can not be limited."" The goal is a beacon of progress, inspiring people upward engine, a person with a big job, must be a big ambition and determination, struggle to the end of the people. In our party's history, countless communists are anchored in the lofty ideals of communism, with a strong mission to lead the people to work together to change China's fate, creating the world's remarkable achievements; in the army's struggle, the people's sons and daughters of the military is to shoulder the sacred mission of safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to strive relentlessly towards the established goals, so that all the way through the thorns and obstacles, to overcome countless difficulties and obstacles, and to continue to fight to the end, to overcome the difficulties and obstacles, and to continue to fight to the end. They have overcome countless difficulties and obstacles, and are constantly moving from victory to victory. Standing on a new starting line, facing the call of the goal, for the revolutionary soldiers of the new era, the most urgent and critical thing is to anchor the army on schedule to achieve the goal of one hundred years of the founding of the people's army, to speed up the people's army to build a world-class army, and to take up the responsibility and fight relentlessly. This requires us to fully grasp the less than five years, not only have ""10,000 years too long, only strive for a day and night"" sense of urgency, but also have ""the yellow sands of the hundred battles through the gold armor, not break the building of the end of the orchid,"" the steadfastness of the persistence, with the state of dryness and vigilance, with the passion of the 100-meter sprint, to do our duty. Do your duty, do a good job, in the new journey to run out of acceleration, to win new victories, with a new struggle to write a new splendor. ""The heaven and earth, the adversity of all things; time and light, the passing of a hundred generations."" Time waits for no one, history waits for no one. A person who is happy to race with time will get the gift of time and ride the tide of the times. The greatest need in life is to be needed. As the main practitioner of the army's 100-year goal, in the face of the party and the people's cause needs, the development of the situation and mission and the fulfillment of the requirements of the duty, we must be on the shoulders of the mission, unremittingly enterprising, and strive to be a pioneer of a strong army, build a strong military cause. Life can have a few times to fight, this time do not fight when to fight? In the golden season of life, the majority of officers and soldiers must be regarded as a responsibility to struggle, as a habit, into a spirit, so that youth because of the struggle and colorful, so that life because of the struggle and rich and full. Committed to extraordinary goals, when there is an extraordinary struggle, extraordinary character. Struggle is to pay hard work, we must establish the idea of hard struggle, do more suffering, often suffer, eat a lot of suffering, along the selected road unswervingly go on, regardless of any hardship, firmly believe that ""the long wind will sometimes break the waves,"" do not stop and do not give up, to the end of the will to fight and anchored in the goal of perseverance, suffering! Do not speak of suffering, and do something in the midst of suffering. To come up with a state of full strength, after a hundred difficulties in the heart of unchanged, thousands of attacks on the feelings remain, dare to eat the ordinary people can not eat the pain, and strive to create extraordinary achievements in ordinary positions. The narrow road to meet the courage to win, the two armies against the ability to win. Struggle needs to be supported by the quality of ability, the quality of ability to go, the struggle is a low-speed struggle; only as soon as possible to enhance the quality of ability, in order to better achieve the goal of the struggle.

The country should be ruled by law, and the army should be ruled by law. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core profoundly grasps the characteristics and laws of the new era of building the military and governing the military, from the overall situation of the cause of strengthening the country and strengthening the military, the rule of law will be incorporated into the overall overall state of the overall rule of law, and make it clear that the rule of law is the basic way for the Party to build the military and govern the military, comprehensively break down the goal of ruling the military according to law and draw up a blueprint, and lead the military to speed up the construction of a system of military rule of law with Chinese characteristics and to promote a fundamental change in the way of governing the military and Continuously improve the level of rule of law in national defense and military construction. The rule of law is a distinctive feature of a modernized army, and a necessary path to building a world-class army. The implementation of the strategy of governing the military according to law is an important decision and deployment made by the CPC Central Committee to grasp the characteristics and laws of building and governing the military in the new era, and to start from the overall situation of the cause of strengthening the military. We must deeply understand the significance of implementing the strategy of governing the army according to law, and effectively strengthen the conscientiousness and firmness of implementation. Rule by law is an important guarantee for the realization of the absolute leadership of the Party over the army. The Party's absolute leadership of the army is inseparable from a set of systematic and complete, centralized and unified, authoritative and efficient military system. This is a significant advantage of our national system and national governance system, and is a profound summary of the Party's experience in leading the people's army in the historical process of revolution, construction and reform. The Party's absolute leadership of the army is based on a series of fundamental principles and systems that must be adhered to no matter how war patterns evolve, how the internal and external environments of army construction change, or how the organization of the army is adjusted. To further promote the rule of law, we must resolutely defend the fundamental principles and systems of the Party's absolute leadership of the military, comprehensively and thoroughly implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, improve and perfect the system of Party construction in the military, enhance the stability, authority and standardization of the fundamental principles and systems of the Party's absolute leadership of the military, and ensure that the Party commands the implementation of the principle of command of the gun by the coercive force of the rule of law. The rule of law is an important support for improving the army's ability to win modern wars. No system of soldiers, capable of generals, can not win. Modern war battlefield space territory multi-dimensional, combat elements highly linked, combat tempo unprecedentedly accelerated, combat management is more refined, the coordination of force action is more complex, the war process is increasingly scientific. If there is no regulation of the combat command and combat forces to regulate the regulation of the combat force of each system, each element of the organic integration, will inevitably play chaos, and even can not fight the war. In-depth promotion of the rule of law, to make up for the shortcomings of the past in the construction of regulations and systems, closely around the combat power system supporting the same direction, to strengthen the whole system, the whole element, the whole field of the construction of regulations and systems, and promote the rule of law and the chain of command chain, the construction chain, the management chain, the chain of supervision of the chain of coupling, so that it has become a well-organized, coordinated and comfortable functioning of the organic whole, in order to take the initiative to win the war in the future to provide a strong, precise and efficient guarantee of the rule of law. Strong, precise and efficient rule of law guarantee. The rule of law is to maintain the army's excellent style of governance. Style is the leaf, the rule of law is the root, the system is this. History and practice have proved that the people's army's excellent style and strict discipline are constantly refined and molded in the process of ruling the army according to law and strictly governing the army. Suddenly, campaign style to grasp style, strict discipline, often treat the symptoms but not the root cause. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the People's Army has unswervingly promoted the rule of law, strict discipline, and has put a brake on the crooked winds and evils that have not been put in place for a long time, and has corrected the stubborn and chronic diseases that have not been removed for many years, so that the People's Army has established a good appearance. In-depth promotion of the rule of law, we must adhere to the root of the problem, the symptoms and root causes, not only to promote the practical achievements of style construction into a systematic mechanism, but also to strengthen the implementation of laws and regulations, to strict orientation, strict standards, strict initiatives, and to promote the construction of style is always running on the track of the rule of law. Second, President Xi's series of important expositions on governing the military according to law is rich in connotation and profound, containing a scientific worldview and methodology, and is a fundamental guideline for the in-depth promotion of governing the military according to law. Building a military rule of law system with Chinese characteristics. In-depth promotion of the rule of law is a complex systematic project, there must be a general overview, pulling all sides of the general grasp, the general grasp is to build a military rule of law system with Chinese characteristics. Adhere to the construction of military rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, is the inherent requirements of the comprehensive rule of law, is to promote the rule of law is the core task of the army, for the realization of the party's goal of strengthening the army in the new era, the people's army to build a comprehensive world-class army to provide a strong rule of law guarantee. To further promote the rule of law, we must accelerate the construction of a military rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, form a systematic and complete, strict and efficient system of military regulations and systems, military rule of law implementation system, military rule of law supervision system, military rule of law protection system, and promote the coordination of various systems, in order to fully release the efficacy of military governance to provide an important rule of law support. Promote a fundamental change in the way the military is governed. President Xi put forward the realization of the ""three fundamental changes"" in the way the military is governed, reflecting the strategic transformation of the modernization of the military to change the inherent requirements of the way the military is governed, and clearly defined the new situation to improve the level of national defense and military construction of the rule of law is an important focus point. In-depth promotion of the rule of law, to jump out of the old system of thinking, inherent patterns, path dependence, in accordance with the requirements of the rule of law to change the way of governing the military, to realize from the practice of purely relying on administrative orders to the administration of law, from the way of purely relying on habits and experience to the way of relying on the rules and regulations to carry out the work of a fundamental change, from the way of surprise, campaign to grasp the way of work to do things according to the orders and regulations, so as to adapt to the deepening of the national defense and military construction. It is a fundamental shift from a sudden and campaigning approach to working according to rules and regulations, thus adapting to the process of deepening the reform of national defense and the military and giving maximum play to the superiority of the new system. Improving the level of rule of law in national defense and military construction. The more modernized and informatized the military becomes, the more it must be subject to the rule of law. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, China's national defense and military construction has made great progress, but the low level of the rule of law remains a shortcoming in the construction and development of our military. President Xi pointed out that it is necessary to implement the strategy of ruling the military according to law, improve the level of rule of law in national defense and military construction, and provide strong rule of law safeguards to promote the cause of strengthening the military. To further promote the rule of law, we must constantly strengthen the military's belief in the rule of law and the rule of law thinking, adhere to the iron law of strict governance, adhere to the unity of the law and strictness, highlighting the rule of law, the rule of law, relying on the officers and soldiers to work together to build the rule of law, the rule of law, and safeguard the rule of law. We should standardize, regulate and refine the construction and management of the army through rules and regulations, so as to forge our army into an elite brigade that is as strong as a mountain of laws and orders and capable of winning battles. The 20th CPC National Congress proposed to realize the goal of building the army for 100 years on schedule, accelerate the building of the people's army into a world-class army, and made a series of strategic plans, putting forward new requirements and clarifying new tasks for the in-depth promotion of ruling the army according to law. We must fully implement the strategy of governing the army according to law, anchor the target direction, take up the mission, focus on contradictions and problems, and take strong measures to provide strong and powerful safeguards for the cause of strengthening the army in the new era. The fundamental principle and system of absolute leadership of the Party over the army has been put into practice. The party commanding the gun is not a slogan, need a set of party leadership of the army system for support. To further promote the rule of law, we must always adhere to the Party's absolute leadership of the military, improve the system and mechanism for implementing the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and ensure that the Party's absolute leadership of the military is put into practice by the binding force of the rule of law. Deepen the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, implement Xi Jinping's thought on the rule of law, and resolutely defend the fundamental principle and system of the Party's absolute leadership of the military in terms of jurisprudence. Deepen the reform of the army's party building system, and establish a sound system of army party building that safeguards the authority and centralized leadership of the CPC Central Committee and ensures the party's absolute leadership of the army. Strengthen the organizational and leadership mechanism for governing the army according to the law, and carry the absolute leadership of the Party over the army through the entire process of governing the army according to the law in all fields, so as to ensure that the governing of the army according to the law is always pushed forward in an orderly manner along the correct path. Put the focus on service preparation for war. The army is first and foremost a combat team, and the ""quasar"" of governing the army according to law should always be aimed at the ""bull's eye"" of combat effectiveness, so as to implement the requirements of actual combat into all aspects and the entire process of military rule of law, and to utilize the rule of law to improve the army's ability to win modern wars and to ensure that the army can effectively carry out the mission and tasks of the new era. The rule of law will be utilized to improve the military's ability to win modern wars and ensure that the military effectively fulfills its mission in the new era. Follow the law of combat effectiveness, give full play to the guiding, regulating, enforcing and safeguarding role of the rule of law, so that the only fundamental standard of combat effectiveness can be truly established, actualized and hardened. Adhering to the military demand as the pull, accelerate the development of reform urgently needed, combat readiness urgently used, officers and soldiers eagerly expected policies, regulations and systems, the establishment of a sound system of socialist military policies and systems with Chinese characteristics, positive incentives, accurate protection, and to further emancipation and development of combat power. Strengthen training supervision, strictly according to the outline of the training, and effectively implement the training program throughout the entire training process, without discounts, without variation, resolutely rectify and cure the problem of training style exercise style examination style is not real, and effectively improve the training of the actual combat, joint, scientific, standardized level, the rule of law to ensure that the preparation for the military struggle to the letter. Seize the leading cadres as a ""key minority"". The leading cadres of the army are the practitioners of the rule of law, but also the organizers and leaders, to a large extent, determines the progress and quality of the rule of law. To promote the rule of law, we must tightly focus on the rule of law, the rule of law, strengthen the supervision and control of the exercise of power in important areas and key links, and effectively put the power into the cage of the system, so that the power to operate in the sun. Leading cadres at all levels should play a good ""leading goose"" role, and constantly improve the ability to use the rule of law thinking and the rule of law to carry out their work, consciously establish a correct concept of power, take the lead in respecting the rule of law, fear of the law, and effectively do the right to use power according to the law, uphold the public good power, honesty and integrity of power, to ""a key few ""The key minority will drive the vast majority, and promote the formation of a good situation in which the party committee makes decisions in accordance with the law, the authorities are guided in accordance with the law, the troops act in accordance with the law, and the officers and soldiers fulfill their duties in accordance with the law. Gathering a strong synergy to promote the rule of law in the military. ""All forces and, then ten thousand pounds is not enough to lift."" The deeper the rule of law, the more the need to strengthen the military, coordination, up and down. It is necessary to strengthen the top-level design, coordination and overall promotion of the rule of law, strengthen the mechanism of the rule of law and strategic planning, focus on the weak links of the rule of law, and coordinate the key tasks. Continuously promote the rule of law in coordination with the overall rule of law, in the overall framework of the rule of law, strengthen the military rule of law strategic planning, strengthen the military policy and regulatory system, strengthen the military rule of law resources and elements to share, and promote the synchronization of the military rule of law capacity. Fully respect the subjective status and creative spirit of officers and soldiers, enhance the rule of law literacy of officers and soldiers, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of officers and soldiers, and cohesion of the majestic force of in-depth advancement of the rule of law in the military.

将人工智能融合应用于兵棋推演，二者会碰撞出怎样的火花？ 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：鲁晓斌 李治军 责任编辑：于雅倩 2023-04-25 06:58:01 0,让人工智能赋能兵棋推演 ■鲁晓斌 李治军 兵棋推演是基于博弈理论和虚拟现实机理等，对现实或未来战争的模拟。人工智能是基于特定算法和行为逻辑，对人脑智慧和机器算力等的聚合呈现。将人工智能融合应用于兵棋推演中，能够为这一传统战争模拟形式插上前沿科技的翅膀，助力拨开智能化战争迷雾。 人工智能融入兵棋推演有助于概念理论创新，使未来战争设计更具科技优势。兵棋被誉为“导演战争的魔术师”，将兵棋推演应用于作战概念、军事理论等战争前端设计，是世界军事强国探索战争走向的重要做法。在迈向智能化战争进程中，概念、理论、机理创新等具有方向引领作用，其受制于适用场景特殊、缺乏验证手段、自身完备性存疑等因素，可能给未来战争设计带来不确定性甚至失败风险。近年来西方作战概念创新价值效能日渐式微，本质上就是论证不周、效费比严重偏离预期等造成的。未来将人工智能融入兵棋推演实践，可以利用智能系统没有人的主观思维定势、可以不断迭代优化逼近期望值等特点，对新型作战概念、军事理论、制胜机理等进行由表及里、由局部到整体、由特殊到一般的推演验证，以消除战争设计的不确定性。 人工智能融入兵棋推演有助于战法研练创新，使未来战争准备更具效率优势。在给定的推演想定、兵力规模、战斗条令基础上，充分发挥“指挥官”的谋略、知识、灵感等主观指导作用，推动战法、训法等创新是兵棋推演的核心价值之一。智能化战争战法研练创新是作战研究的重要内容，其往往受历史战例累积所造成的思维定势、指挥员应激反应所引发的不确定性、敌方伪装欺骗所造成的认知误区、不同智能系统可靠性存疑等因素影响，使战法设计潜藏风险。通过在兵棋推演中融入人工智能并用于指挥所演练、战法设计检验、指挥技能训练等活动，可以发挥人的创造性思维和智能机器效率高误差小等优势，使人机结合的智能蓝军更加多变难测，在极限挑战中逼出真正管用的战法。“阿尔法狗”走出奇妙的围棋招法表明，智能系统用于战法创新设计大有用武之地。 人工智能融入兵棋推演有助于能力运用创新，使未来战争实践更具可靠优势。通过兵棋推演方式验证未来作战系统的使用条件、时机、方式等关键问题，是推动新域新质作战力量融入现有作战体系发挥作用的重要途径。新型作战力量运用研究，存在使用限制条件多、与其他作战域效应耦合复杂、预期效应评估难等问题，在兵棋推演中单纯从人的视角很难对其进行全面审视和把握。借助融合了人工智能的兵棋推演手段，可以通过智能体为新型作战力量预设参数界限，在与人机结合的指挥实体、常规作战力量推演交互中，观测新型作战力量的运用时机、作用过程、效用发挥等信息，以此调整既设参数，使其运用效果不断逼近理想值。外军近年来大规模太空、赛博空间力量运用，均是在反复兵棋推演基础上逐步完善成熟的。 人工智能融入兵棋推演有助于军事力量建设，使未来战争实践更具能力优势。军事力量建设是国防实力的后盾，既与经济、科技和工业发展水平相关，更与军事使命、作战对象和未来任务有关，需要全面过硬的同时，也要具有重点领域的比较优势。是否达到了军力全面过硬？哪些是需要重点突破的领域？如何建立非对称优势？这些问题既不能用一场无把握的实战来回答，也不能跟在对手后面亦步亦趋，更不能想当然去发展，而要借助科学的手段来探寻答案。随着大国竞争日益加剧，军事强国核心决策机构、战略智库等纷纷加强兵棋推演，以预测与竞争对手发生冲突的可能性及应对举措。借助融入智能因子的兵棋推演，未来可以从多层级多维度设计、演练和审视与敌较量的强点、弱点、关节点，在允许失败的推演中细致解剖对手，为战胜对手预作准备，实现未战先胜。 人工智能融入兵棋推演有助于加快对抗研练，使未来战争实践更具认知优势。战场胜败关乎国家存亡，打好首战影响整个战局。世界各国军队为确保首胜和全胜，无不通过多种方式对战役方案、作战计划、攻防环节等进行严格周密的验证完善。兵棋推演作为高度贴近实战的“0.99场战争”，近年来受到越来越多国家重视并在局部战争实践中发挥了巨大作用。运用兵棋推演研练攻防战法，关键是“察敌之必守”“使敌不知其所攻”，既要洞察敌方的“命门”“命脉”在哪，也要谙熟打敌“七寸”“软肋”的方法途径，还要力求己方意图动向不被敌方轻易察觉。借助智能兵棋推演将对手“放在实验台上作千万次解剖”，能够在诱敌与出击、佯动与主攻、守弱与设陷等千变万化的运用中，综合量化打分、专家评估、机器建议等形式洞察全局态势、凝聚高度共识、形成主用对策，为依案求战、先机制敌奠定坚实基础。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230427234657/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16219923.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230425081917/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16219923.html,2023-04-28 0:00:00,What kind of sparks will the two collide when artificial intelligence is fused and applied to military chess deduction? Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Lu Xiaobin Li Zhijun Editor: Yu Yaqian 2023-04-25 06:58:01 0,"Let Artificial Intelligence Empower Military Chess Deduction ■ Lu Xiaobin Li Zhijun Military Chess Deduction is a simulation of real or future war based on game theory and virtual reality mechanisms. Artificial intelligence is based on specific algorithms and behavioral logic, the human brain intelligence and machine arithmetic and other aggregated presentation. The integration of artificial intelligence applied to military chess projections can insert the wings of cutting-edge science and technology for this traditional form of war simulation, and help to open the fog of intelligent war. The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess projections helps conceptual and theoretical innovation, making future war design more technological advantages. Military chess is known as ""the magician who directs the war"", and the application of military chess deduction to the front-end design of combat concepts, military theories and other wars is an important practice of the world's military powers to explore the direction of war. In the process of moving towards intelligent war, concept, theory, mechanism innovation and other innovations have a leading role in the direction, which is subject to special application scenarios, the lack of means of verification, the completeness of its own doubtful and other factors, which may bring uncertainty or even the risk of failure to the future war design. In recent years, the value and effectiveness of western combat concept innovation has been declining, which is essentially the result of poor validation and a serious deviation from expectations in terms of efficiency and cost ratio. In the future, artificial intelligence will be integrated into the practice of military chess projections, intelligent systems can be used without human subjective thinking, can be constantly iteratively optimized to approximate the expected value and other characteristics of the new combat concepts, military theories, the mechanism of victory, etc. from the surface to the inside, from local to the whole, from the special to the general projections to verify, in order to eliminate the uncertainty of the design of the war. The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess rehearsal will help the research and practice of warfare innovation and make the preparation for future wars more efficient and advantageous. On the basis of the given deduction idea, troop scale and battle order, giving full play to the strategy, knowledge, inspiration and other subjective guiding role of the ""commander"", and promoting the innovation of war tactics and training methods is one of the core values of the military chess deduction. Intelligent war tactics research and practice innovation is an important part of combat research, which is often affected by the thinking stereotypes caused by the accumulation of historical war cases, the uncertainty caused by the commander's stress reaction, the cognitive misunderstanding caused by the enemy's camouflage and deception, and the doubtful reliability of different intelligent systems, etc., so that the tactics design is potentially risky. Through the integration of artificial intelligence in the military chess deduction and used in the command post exercise, battle method design test, command skills training and other activities, can play the human creative thinking and intelligent machine efficiency and error and other advantages, so that the combination of man and machine of the intelligent blue army is more changeable and unpredictable, in the ultimate challenge to force out the real useful battle method. ""Alpha Dog"" out of the marvelous Go moves show that the intelligent system for the innovative design of the battle method is very useful. The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess projections will contribute to the innovation of capability utilization and make the practice of future wars more reliable and advantageous. Verification of the conditions, timing, mode and other key issues of future combat systems through the military chess projections is an important way to promote the integration of new combat forces in new domains into the existing combat system. The research on the utilization of new type of combat power has many constraints, complex coupling with the effects of other combat domains, and difficult to assess the expected effects, etc. It is difficult to comprehensively examine and grasp the new type of combat power purely from the human point of view in the military chess projection. With the integration of artificial intelligence means of military chess deduction, can through the intelligent body for the new combat power preset parameter boundaries, in the combination of human and machine command entity, conventional combat power deduction interaction, observation of the new combat power of the use of timing, role of the process, the role of the utility to play, and other information, so as to adjust the established parameters, so that the effect of its use is constantly approaching the ideal value. In recent years, the application of large-scale space and cyberspace forces by foreign armies has been gradually perfected and matured on the basis of repeated military game rehearsals. The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess projections will help the construction of military forces and make the practice of future wars more capable and advantageous. Military force construction is the backing of national defense strength, both related to the level of economic, scientific and technological and industrial development, but also related to the military mission, combat objects and future tasks, the need to be comprehensively superior at the same time, but also to have a comparative advantage in key areas. Has it reached a comprehensive military strength? What are the key areas that need to be broken through? How to establish asymmetric advantages? These questions can neither be answered by a real battle without certainty, nor can we follow our opponents' lead, nor can we take development for granted, but with the help of scientific means to explore the answers. With the increasing competition among big powers, the core decision-making organizations and strategic think tanks of military powers have strengthened the military chess projections in order to predict the possibility of conflict with competitors and their response measures. With the help of military chess rehearsal incorporating intelligent factors, in the future, it is possible to design, rehearse and scrutinize the strong points, weak points and joints of the contest with the enemy from multi-level and multi-dimensional aspects, and meticulously dissect the opponents in the rehearsal allowing for failures to be made in order to prepare for victory over the opponents and realize victory before the battle. The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess rehearsal will help speed up confrontation research and practice, and make future war practice more cognitively advantageous. Winning or losing on the battlefield is a matter of national survival, and playing the first battle well affects the entire war situation. In order to ensure the first victory and total victory, armies of all countries in the world will carry out rigorous and thorough verification and improvement of battle programs, operational plans, attack and defense links, etc. through various ways. As the ""0.99 war"" which is highly close to the actual battle, the military-chess projections have been emphasized by more and more countries in recent years and have played a great role in the local war practice. The key to the use of military chess deduction in the study and practice of offensive and defensive tactics is to ""inspect the enemy's necessary defenses"" and ""make the enemy unaware of its attack"", not only to gain insight into the enemy's ""life gate"" and ""life vein"" in which the enemy's ""life gate"" and ""life vein"" are located, but also to improve and perfect the military chess deduction. Lifeline"" in which, but also familiar with the enemy ""seven inches"" ""soft underbelly"" of the method way, but also strive to their own intentions movements are not easily perceived by the enemy. With the help of intelligent military chess deduction will be opponents ""on the experimental stage for ten million times dissection"", can be in the lure the enemy and attack, feinting and the main attack, defend the weak and set up traps and so on thousands of variations of the use of integrated quantitative scoring, expert assessment, machine recommendations and other forms of insight into the overall situation, cohesion of a high degree of consensus, the formation of the main countermeasures for the case for the war, the mechanism of the first enemy Lay a solid foundation.","The integration of artificial intelligence into military chess deduction will help speed up confrontation research and practice, and make future war practice more cognitively advantageous."

The CPC Central Committee recently issued the ""Work Program on the Party-wide Promotion of Investigation and Research"", which emphasizes that we must insist on overcoming difficulties, carry forward the spirit of struggle, enhance the ability to struggle, have the courage to wade through dangers and difficulties, know the difficulties and meet them, and transform the results of investigation and research into practical results to promote work and overcome difficulties. In the face of all kinds of difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, the majority of Party members and cadres, especially the leading cadres, must be closely integrated with the center of work and decision-making needs to be investigated and studied, in the attack to overcome the difficulties of cracking the contradictions, in the breakthrough in the defuse the risk, relying on the tenacity of the struggle to open up the cause of the development of a new world. Practice has proved that any work, are not easy, beat the drum can be completed, will inevitably encounter ""stumbling blocks"" and ""roadblocks"", survey research is the same. If there is a lack of spirit of struggle, unwilling to face the challenges, do not dare to touch the interests, can not overcome the difficulties, hesitation in the face of risk hesitation, shirking responsibilities when encountering problems, to solve the difficulty of lowering the standard, then even better plans, and then the actual measures will become a piece of paper. Do a good job of investigation and research work, we must drum up the courage to know the difficulties and rise to the occasion. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: ""What is called work, work is a struggle. Those places have difficulties and problems that we need to solve."" From Song Renxin, who traveled around the nearby villages and counties to mobilize the masses for self-help in response to the harsh environment of the base area, to Yang Shanzhou, who ran around the fields to promote rice-planting technology for the sake of changing the appearance of the poor villages along the borders, to Yang Yegong, who, in the face of a lack of equipment and talents, led a team to run around the country's missile manufacturers and scientific research institutes, and compiled a tutorial for a certain new type of missile specialty... ...They are not unaware of the easy path, but precisely because they are aware of the dangers ahead and the need for someone to step forward, so they resolutely choose to know the weight of the burden. ""Commit it to the hardest and figure it out."" Difficulty is not terrible, the terrible thing is to avoid difficulties. Party members and cadres must adhere to both dry in the real and dry in the difficult place, the more dangerous the more forward, the narrow road to the courage to win, where the difficulties, contradictions, where to go, where the officers and soldiers focused on the work of the situation where to go, do not engage in the poor to love the rich type of research. Only the courage to break through the ""comfort zone"", bite the bullet, dare to think, dare to do, in order to better fulfill the mission. Do a good job of investigation and research work, need to uphold the system with the matter, the strategy of scientific strain. Wading through the dangerous shoals, break the problem can not be impatient, blindly do, if the ""situation is not determined"", will be reckless, not only can not do anything, but also bad. Only scientific judgment of the situation, in-depth analysis of the problem, in order to find countermeasures to overcome the difficulties. Grass-roots level is at the end of the chain of war construction and preparedness to promote the integration of the most often encountered acute contradictions, complex situations, for example, constraints on the construction of combat effectiveness of bottlenecks, education and management of the thorny problem, the legacy of the difficult problems. This requires researchers to be good at analyzing specific problems, to find out what are the shortcomings of the system and mechanism, what is the responsibility for the work of the fall of the empty caused by the development and change of the situation caused by the precise ""defuse the bomb"", the right medicine. Good at grasping the main contradictions, what problems are prominent to focus on solving what problems, what work is urgent to grasp what work to focus on promoting the cracking of the problem, so as to win the initiative. Good at breaking through inertia thinking, from the solidified model, the shackles of the set mechanism to liberate, both the use of innovative thinking to crack the current contradictions and problems, but also adhere to the forward-looking thinking to prevent and resolve the emergence of new contradictions and new problems. Do a good job of investigation and research work, should also maintain the tenacity of biting the green mountain, the pragmatic period must be accomplished. Investigation and research can not be achieved overnight, need to pay hard and persistent efforts, ready to accept the temporary loss, local failure, the stage of failure. But the long and hard work of the people into, but the courage to fight to win. Investigation and research should be anchored to the goal of not relaxing the strength of the spirit of perseverance to the spirit of fools, the spirit of nails to take responsibility, a problem a problem research, a contradiction a contradiction breakthrough, make every effort to solve the problem in the present, solve the problem in the term. Especially for a moment difficult to gnaw down the ""hard bones"", to clarify the goal, differentiate responsibilities, sustained efforts, linkage attack; for those who have not been cured of the problem of the accumulated ills and chronic illnesses, to find the entry point and breakthroughs, tightly grasp, perseverance, do not see the results do not let go, do not reach the goal do not retreat.","The article emphasizes the need to have the courage to face challenges and overcome difficulties while promoting work through the results of investigation and research. Party members and cadres, particularly leading cadres, are encouraged to be closely involved with work and decision-making needs, attack and overcome difficulties in cracking contradictions, diffuse risks, and rely on struggle to open up the cause of development. The authors also mention the practice of knowing the difficulties and rising to the occasion, as well as upholding the system with matters and scientific strain to achieve better results in investigation and research work."

奋力实现建军一百年奋斗目标丨前瞻智能化作战编成设计 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：蒋艳 刘争元 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2023-05-04 07:07:34 0,前瞻智能化作战编成设计 ■蒋 艳 刘争元 引 言 党的二十大作出如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标的战略部署，并强调要完善军事力量结构编成。随着人工智能技术的加速发展，智能化武器装备已经登上现代战争舞台，从根本上重塑未来战争形态。为抢占未来战争主动权，应该深入研究智能化作战编成特点要求，加快构建完善适应未来战争形态的军事力量结构编成。 智能化作战编成能够充分释放军队作战效能 作战编成，是指为达成一定作战目的，将参战力量组合而形成的有机整体，其关键是有效释放人与武器装备的战斗潜能。智能化作战编成，是指在智能化战争条件下，将参战力量进行智能组合而形成的有机整体，其关键是充分发挥其中智能化要素及体系的最大作用，最大限度地释放人与武器装备的战斗潜能。 释放武器装备的智能化要素，实现以智赋能自主作战。武器装备是作战编成的重要组成要素，任何新式武器装备的出现都为作战编成的释能提供了基础。在热兵器时代和机械化时代，作战编成聚焦于如何释放蕴藏在武器装备中的热能和机械能。智能化武器装备的出现则带来了跨时代的变革——武器装备不仅具有热能和机械能，还包含以前不具备的智能化要素。因此，智能化作战编成旨在释放智能化要素的潜能，将武器装备的智能充分运用于实际作战中。例如，机器人部队、无人机编队等，都着眼于释放武器装备中智能化要素的潜能，其使用的枪械、导弹虽然在形式上仍是传统作战要素，但它们的新增战斗力主要源于智能化要素。 释放智能化要素间的协同力，实现多维多重组合协同作战。人与武器装备是作战编成中的两个核心要素，二者的相互作用是作战编成产生战斗力的重要源头。特别是智能化武器装备与人进行协同作战时，出现人机协同、机机协同等新形式，这既不同于以往人与人之间的协同，也不同于传统的为人编配武器装备，而是具有不同智能化程度的作战编成要素之间的多维多重组合。由于智能化要素自身的不确定性、自主性、创新性，在其相互形成的作战编成中也产生了更加复杂多样的作战效能。例如，在无人机作战编成中，涉及作战主体相互间的掩护协同、时空协同、异质协同等功能性合作，作战运用复杂。智能化作战编成就是要通过建立灵活、协调、精准的协同关系，最大限度释放出不同作战要素间的协同作战效能。 释放智能化作战体系的组织力，实现智能嵌入的体系作战。组织力是将组织内部的各种要素进行调配、统合，从而展现出的体系合力。未来战争中，以智能化作战编成为基础形成的作战体系将产生具有智能化特点的组织力。这主要是因为各要素的调配和统合过程除了人的参与之外，还增加了智能化武器装备、物联网、通信网等要素，使得系统运转、信息传递、作战协同等组织运行活动体现出智能化组织的独有特点。鉴于智能化组织结构更加灵活，组织要素的跨域融合性更强，编成模式更加多变，因此智能化作战编成的作用机理，就在于充分发挥智能化组织的自主性、耦合性、系统性，从而释放智能化组织内部的组织力，使智能化技术、装备通过组织体系的融合，产生强大的战斗力。 深刻把握智能化作战编成设计的基本要求 智能化作战编成是一个综合性、复杂性较强的过程，应综合考虑作战力量体系中智能化要素的特性和作用，深刻把握智能化作战编成设计的基本要求，切实形成“1+1＞2”的作战效果。 突出灵活重构的设计理念。智能化的作战形态包括网络支撑的作战体系、分散聚能的兵力布局和自主协同的作战行动，使得智能化作战编成更加需要突出灵活重构的设计理念。灵活重构，重点是改变机械化时代的固定编成，探索智能化时代多域融合、动态可变的灵活编成，以功能简单、结构稳定的单元节点为基础，通过众多异构复杂作战单元进行灵活编成，利用节点间的通信交互进行信息共享、组合优化。同时，智能化作战编成既要快速聚合来自不同地域、不同建制的作战力量，也要根据战场形势随时分散、转换编成，结合作战任务、组网方式、混编队形、效果评估等灵活组建作战单元，快速形成即时优势。 满足智能化作战样式需求。智能化战争中，将出现算法战、无人自主作战、无人集群协同作战等新的作战样式，作战空间、作战对象、作战手段等都发生了较大变化，相应地对智能化作战编成也提出了新的要求。因此，智能化作战编成要紧紧围绕智能化作战样式特点，不断研析机理、摸准需求，针对作战需求及时调整作战编成思路，探索作战编成与作战样式高度融合的机理，合理编配兵力、形成组织合力，充分释放智能化作战样式蕴含的战斗力，确保高效完成作战任务，实现作战目的。 顺应智能化作战力量变化。智能化战场上出现了无人机、无人车、无人艇、自主防御作战力量、机器人部队等诸多新型作战力量，促使作战范围不断拓展、可选参战力量类型持续增加、战争进程突变可能性增大。作战编成不仅涉及同一空间内的有人/无人系统之间、无人系统之间的互相匹配，还涉及多域空间内各力量或平台之间的相互组合，作战编成的可能性和复杂性急剧增大。因此，智能化作战编成应充分发挥大数据、智能化算法的技术支撑作用，适应智能化作战力量体系的多样性、系统化特点，努力提高复杂作战编成能力和自主作战编成能力，实现多种作战力量的最优组合。 设计适应未来战争形态的智能化作战编成 随着智能化武器装备的应用和普及，相关作战编成模式也不断丰富和完善。设计智能化作战编成，应适应未来作战样式发展，打破传统编成模式，促进智能化力量从数量叠加向内嵌融合转化。 基于人机混合的协同编成。基于人机混合的协同编成，是指将智能化武器装备平台与有人平台进行组合编成。这种作战编成并非简单的有人/无人叠加组合，而是按照特定的体系结构、逻辑关系、控制模式、工作流程等将人机结合成一个整体。智能化作战编成需要建立灵活的人机交互模式和精确的编队控制模式，将人的经验判断与机器的快速数据处理、精准逻辑推理相结合，充分综合人和机器的智能，发挥人和机器的各自优势，实现人机最优协同。例如，由无人机率先担负战场侦察、目标锁定、攻击引导等任务，有人机随后负责火力打击、消除目标，二者相互协同，实现优势互补。 基于无人系统的集中编成。基于无人系统的集中编成，是指能够集中释放智能化作战力量战斗力潜能的作战编成。历史上，每当一种新的作战力量出现后，常常会被集中使用。例如，骑兵出现后有了骑兵部队，坦克出现后有了坦克部队。无人作战力量可以长时间适应极端危险环境，能够快速反应、精准行动，它的优势是突出编队集结、队形保持、编队重构等行动的自动化，面对复杂环境时可以自主规划、智能避障、智能决策、自主攻击等，可在增强火力的同时减少人员伤亡、加快作战节奏。因此无人机编队、机器人编队等基于无人系统的集中编成便应运而生。 基于智能化网络的联合编成。基于智能化网络的联合编成，是指借助智能化网络，深度聚合有人与无人、兵力与火力等力量，形成可独立完成任务的模块化作战单元或小型作战体系，分别配置在作战体系的各层级、各部分，利用智能优势强化既有的编成效能。主要包括三种类型：首先是跨域联合编成。作战编成的每个作战单元都具有多种灵活可变的作战编成方案，分别适用于域内作战和跨域作战需求，能够随时转换作战编成模式，满足不同领域作战需求。其次是跨层联合编成。智能化作战力量既能完成战略性作战任务，也能从事战术性具体任务，因此作战编成可以在指挥控制链路上实现不同层级的多重跃迁，产生跨级作战编成模式，以完成特定作战任务。最后是自主联合编成。智能化作战力量可以根据战场环境和作战任务，自动确定相互之间的配合与组合，生成编成选择清单，在作战、支援、保障的全链条作战流程中，实现作战单元网络内的最佳编成。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230504014341/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16221576.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230505112813/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16221576.html,2023-05-04 0:00:00,Striving to realize the goal of building the army for one hundred years丨Forward-looking intelligent combat formation design Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Jiang Yan Liu Qiangyuan Responsibility: Guo Yanfei 2023-05-04 07:07:34 0,"Foresight Intelligent Combat Formation Design ■ Jiang Yan Liu Qiangyuan INTRODUCTION The Twentieth Party Congress made the strategic plan to achieve the goal of building the army for one hundred years as scheduled, and emphasized the need to improve the structure and formation of military forces. With the accelerated development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent weapons and equipment have been on the stage of modern war, fundamentally reshaping the shape of future war. In order to seize the initiative in the future war, we should study the characteristics and requirements of intelligent combat organization, and accelerate the construction of a perfect military force structure to adapt to the shape of the future war. Intelligent combat formation can fully release the military combat effectiveness Combat formation, refers to the achievement of certain combat purposes, the combination of combat forces and the formation of the organic whole, the key is to effectively release the combat potential of people and weapons and equipment. Intelligent combat formation, refers to the intelligent war conditions, will participate in the intelligent combination of forces and the formation of the organic whole, the key is to give full play to the maximum role of intelligent elements and systems, to maximize the release of human and weapons and equipment combat potential. Release the intelligent elements of weapons and equipment to realize the intelligent empowerment of autonomous combat. Weapons and equipment is an important component of the combat formation, the emergence of any new type of weapons and equipment for the release of the combat formation provides the basis for the release of energy. In the era of thermal weapons and mechanized era, the combat formation focuses on how to release the thermal and mechanical energy hidden in the weapons and equipment. The emergence of intelligent weapons and equipment has brought about a cross-generational change - weapons and equipment not only have thermal and mechanical energy, but also contain intelligent elements that did not exist before. Therefore, intelligent combat formations aim to unleash the potential of intelligent elements and fully utilize the intelligence of weapons and equipment in actual combat. For example, robotic forces, drone formations, etc., are all aimed at releasing the potential of intelligent elements in weapons and equipment, and the guns and missiles they use, though still traditional combat elements in form, derive their added combat power mainly from intelligent elements. Release the synergistic force between intelligent elements to realize multi-dimensional multiple combinations of coordinated operations. People and weapons and equipment are two core elements in the combat formation, and their interaction is an important source of combat formation to generate combat power. In particular, when intelligent weapons and equipment and people carry out collaborative combat, the emergence of man-machine collaboration, machine-machine collaboration and other new forms, which is different from the previous synergy between people and people, also different from the traditional allocation of weapons and equipment for people, but with different degrees of intelligence between the elements of the combat formation of multi-dimensional multi-combination. Due to the uncertainty, autonomy and innovativeness of the intelligent elements themselves, more complex and diversified combat effectiveness has been generated in the combat formation formed by them. For example, in the UAV combat formation, it involves the functional cooperation among combat subjects such as cover coordination, space-time coordination, heterogeneous coordination, etc., and the combat application is complicated. Intelligent combat formation is to maximize the release of synergistic combat effectiveness among different combat elements by establishing flexible, coordinated and precise synergistic relationships. Release the organizational force of intelligent combat system to realize intelligent embedded system combat. Organizational force is the deployment and unification of various elements within the organization, thus demonstrating the synergy of the system. In the future war, the combat system formed on the basis of intelligent combat formation will generate organizational force with intelligent characteristics. This is mainly because the deployment and integration process of the elements in addition to human participation, but also increased intelligent weapons and equipment, Internet of Things, communication networks and other elements, so that the system operation, information transfer, combat coordination and other organizational activities reflect the unique characteristics of intelligent organizations. Given that the intelligent organization structure is more flexible, the cross-domain integration of organizational elements is stronger, and the formation mode is more variable, the mechanism of intelligent combat formation lies in giving full play to the autonomy, coupling, and systematicity of the intelligent organization, so as to release the organizational force within the intelligent organization, and enable the intelligent technology and equipment to produce a strong combat force through the integration of the organizational system. Profoundly grasp the basic requirements of intelligent combat formation design Intelligent combat formation is a comprehensive, complex process, should take into account the characteristics and role of intelligent elements in the combat force system, profoundly grasp the basic requirements of intelligent combat formation design, and effectively form a ""1+1>2"" combat effect. Highlight the design concept of flexible reconfiguration. Intelligent combat formations include network-supported combat systems, decentralized force layouts, and autonomous and coordinated combat operations, making it even more necessary to highlight the flexible reconfiguration design concepts of intelligent combat formations. Flexible reconfiguration, the focus is to change the mechanized era of fixed formation, explore the intelligent era of multi-domain fusion, dynamic and variable flexible formation, based on simple functions, structural stability of the unit nodes, through the many heterogeneous and complex combat units for flexible formation, the use of communication and interaction between the nodes to carry out information sharing, optimization of the combination. At the same time, intelligent combat formation should not only quickly aggregate combat forces from different geographical areas and different formations, but also disperse and transform the formation at any time according to the battlefield situation, and flexibly form combat units by combining combat tasks, networking methods, mixing formations, and effect assessment, so as to quickly form immediate advantages. Meet the demand for intelligent combat style. Intelligent war, there will be algorithmic warfare, unmanned autonomous combat, unmanned clusters of coordinated combat and other new combat styles, combat space, combat objects, combat tactics, etc. have undergone major changes, and accordingly, the intelligent combat formation has also put forward new requirements. Therefore, intelligent combat formation should be closely around the characteristics of intelligent combat styles, constantly analyze the mechanism, feel the demand, timely adjustment of combat formation ideas for combat needs, explore the mechanism of high integration of combat formation and combat styles, rational allocation of forces, the formation of organizational synergy, the full release of intelligent combat styles of combat power to ensure the efficient completion of combat tasks, to achieve the purpose of the operation. Comply with intelligent combat force changes. Intelligent battlefield has seen the emergence of unmanned aircraft, unmanned vehicles, unmanned boats, autonomous defense forces, robotics forces and many other new combat forces, prompting the expansion of the scope of combat, the types of optional combat forces continue to increase, the possibility of sudden changes in the course of the war increased. Operational organization not only involves the mutual matching between manned/unmanned systems and unmanned systems in the same space, but also involves the mutual combination of forces or platforms in multi-domain space, so that the possibility and complexity of operational organization increase dramatically. Therefore, intelligent combat formation should give full play to the technical support of big data and intelligent algorithms, adapt to the diversity and systematic characteristics of the intelligent combat force system, and strive to improve the ability of complex combat formation and autonomous combat formation, so as to realize the optimal combination of multiple combat forces. Designing intelligent combat formation to adapt to future war patterns With the application and popularization of intelligent weapons and equipment, the relevant combat formation modes are also constantly enriched and improved. With the application and popularization of intelligent weapons and equipment, the relevant combat formation modes are also constantly enriched and improved. The design of intelligent combat formation should adapt to the development of future combat styles, break the traditional formation mode, and promote the transformation of intelligent forces from quantitative superposition to embedded fusion. Based on the human-machine hybrid cooperative formation. Based on the human-machine hybrid cooperative formation, refers to the intelligent weapons and equipment platform and manned platform for combination formation. This kind of combat formation is not a simple manned/unmanned superimposed combination, but in accordance with a specific system structure, logical relationship, control mode, workflow, etc., the man-machine combination into a whole. Intelligent combat formation requires the establishment of flexible human-machine interaction mode and precise formation control mode, combining human experience judgment with machine's fast data processing and precise logical reasoning, fully integrating human and machine intelligence, giving full play to human and machine's respective advantages, and realizing optimal coordination between human and machine. For example, the unmanned aircraft will take the lead in tasks such as battlefield reconnaissance, target locking, and attack guidance, and the manned aircraft will then be responsible for fire strikes and elimination of the target, with the two collaborating with each other to realize complementary advantages. Centralized formation based on unmanned systems. Centralized formation based on unmanned systems refers to the combat formation that can focus on releasing the combat potential of intelligent combat forces. Historically, whenever a new type of combat force emerges, it is often centralized. For example, cavalry emerged with cavalry units, and tanks emerged with tank units. Unmanned combat forces can adapt to extreme dangerous environments for long periods of time, and are capable of rapid response and precise action. Its advantage is that it highlights the automation of actions such as formation assembly, formation maintenance, and formation reconfiguration, and when faced with complex environments, it can autonomously plan, intelligently avoid obstacles, intelligently make decisions, and autonomously attack, etc., and it can reduce casualties and accelerate the tempo of combat while enhancing its firepower. Therefore, the centralized formation based on unmanned systems, such as drone formation and robot formation, has come into being. Intelligent network-based joint formation. Intelligent network-based joint formation refers to the use of intelligent networks, in-depth aggregation of manned and unmanned, force and firepower and other forces, the formation of modular combat units that can independently complete the task or a small combat system, respectively, configured in the combat system at all levels, each part of the use of intelligent advantages to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing formation. Mainly includes three types: first, cross-domain joint formation. Each combat unit of the combat formation has a variety of flexible and variable combat formation programs, which are applicable to intra-domain combat and cross-domain combat requirements, and are able to convert the combat formation mode at any time to meet the combat requirements of different domains. Secondly, it is cross-layer joint formation. Intelligent combat forces can not only complete strategic combat tasks, but also engage in tactical specific tasks, so the combat formation can realize multiple leaps at different levels on the command and control link, resulting in cross-level combat formation mode to complete specific combat tasks. Finally, there is autonomous joint formation. Intelligent combat forces can, based on the battlefield environment and combat tasks, automatically determine the cooperation and combination between each other, generate a formation selection list, and realize the optimal formation within the network of combat units in the whole chain of combat processes of combat, support, and protection.","The goal of building the Chinese military for one hundred years involves improving the structure and formation of military forces. The article discusses the importance of intelligent combat formations in the current times, where AI and intelligent weapons are becoming prevalent. The article states that intelligent combat formations aim to maximize the potential of intelligent elements, such as autonomous combat, synergistic force between intelligent elements, and intelligent embedded system combat.

We must accurately understand and grasp the scientific connotation of the general requirements from a holistic point of view, to ensure that the direction is correct, clear thinking, and promote the actual. Accurately understand the foundation of ""learning ideas"". Adhere to the ideological construction of the Party, the theory of the Party, continue to use the latest achievements of the Party's innovative theories to arm the whole Party, is the key to our Party is always full of vigor and vitality. President Xi pointed out that all the Party's centralized educational activities have been headed by ideological education, focusing on solving the problems of in-depth learning, unity of thought and failure to keep up with actions. From the Party's mass line education and practice activities, the ""Three Strictnesses and Three Truths"" thematic education, to the ""Two Schools and One Doing"" learning and education, the theme of ""Never Forget the Beginning, Keep the Mission in Mind"" education, and then to the Party's history, the Party's history and education. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has persistently used Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era to forge the soul and lead the way forward. To learn the ideology is to comprehensively study and systematically master the basic viewpoints and scientific system of this ideology, grasp the worldview and methodology of this ideology, adhere to and apply the position and viewpoint methodology throughout it, and continuously enhance the political, ideological, theoretical, and emotional recognition of the Party's innovative theories, so as to truly learn Marxism from the best, and consciously guide all the work with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The socialist thought of Xi Jinping in the new era of Chinese characteristics is used consciously to guide all the work. Accurately understand the key of ""strong party character"". Party character is the cornerstone for Party members and cadres to establish themselves, their careers, their words and their morals, and it must be constantly strengthened in the exercise of strict Party life. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era not only contains important ideas on how the Party governs the country, it also contains the requirements for the political character, value pursuit, spirituality, and style of conduct of the Chinese Communist Party. To strengthen the party character, we should deeply understand the series of requirements of this ideology on firming ideals and beliefs, upgrading the state of mind, and strengthening the party character, consciously use it to transform the subjective world, deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", and enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", The two established, deeply comprehend the decisive significance, enhance the ""four consciousness"", ""four confidence"", ""two maintenance"", implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, always ideologically, politically and operationally with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the CPC Central Committee to maintain a high degree of consistency, and always maintain the political character of the Communists. Accurately understand the direction of ""emphasize practice"". Adhering to the principle of starting from reality, linking theory to practice, seeking truth from facts, and testing and developing truth in practice are the most important theoretical qualities of Marxism. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has been continuously refined and gradually sublimated on the basis of practical experience, and at the same time has demonstrated a strong power of truth in guiding and promoting practice. To emphasize practice is to consciously practice Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, use it to transform the objective world and promote the development of undertakings, use it to observe the times, grasp the times, and lead the times, gain a deep insight into the times and the situations, the dangers and the opportunities, and positively identify changes and seek changes, solve the contradictions and problems that exist in economic and social development and the construction of the Party, guard against and defuse the major risks, and promote the modernization of the Chinese style to make new progress and new breakthroughs. Breakthroughs. Accurately understand the goal of ""building new achievements"".

耗散战：智能化战争典型方式 来源： 中国军网-解放军报 作者：王荣辉 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2023-05-09 07:11:48 0,耗散战：智能化战争典型方式 ■王荣辉 引 言 随着智能化技术快速发展及在军事上的广泛应用，智能化战争正成为信息化战争后的新战争形态，而耗散战则成为智能化战争的典型方式。所谓耗散战，是指智能化战争体系通过对内富聚融合，对外突变涌现，达成集物质消耗、能量释散和信息扩散于一体的综合战力的作战方式。加强耗散战研究，有利于我们深入揭示智能化战争制胜机理，赢得未来战争博弈主动权。 耗散战是时代发展的必然结果 耗散战表现在智能化时代中物理域、信息域和认知域的综合对抗，体现为政治较量、经济比拼、军事攻防、文化冲突和外交制衡等形式的高度统一，反映了智能化战争体系所具有的开放性、复杂性和涌现性。 适应智能化时代的安全形势要求。进入智能化时代，宽网络、大数据、大模型、云计算、深度学习等技术快速发展，各政治集团、国家、民族之间的联系更加广泛。在政治多元、经济交融、社会开放、技术革命等多重因素作用下，非传统安全兴起并与传统威胁交织，智能化战争主体和范畴不断拓展，战争时间与空间不断外延，战争与和平如影相随并交织一体，战争体系将进一步超越局部地域限制，从相对封闭走向更加开放，形成更高层次和更大范围的对抗。耗散战强调智能化战争体系在物理域、信息域和认知域的综合发力，把政治较量、经济比拼、军事攻防、文化冲突和外交制衡等形式高度统一并纳入敌我对抗范畴，适应了世界安全形势发展的时代要求。 符合战争形态演变的客观规律。战争体系的耗散现象自战争产生以来便始终存在，只不过在智能化战争形态出现之前，由于技术的制约，一直处于较为低级的、简单的状态，战争对抗仅能表现为物质消耗、能量释散和信息扩散中的某一种形式。农业时代，战争形态主要表现为以物质要素为主导的、以人体为中心的冷兵器战争。工业化时代，战争形态主要表现为以能量要素为主导的、以平台为中心的热核兵器和机械化战争。信息化时代，战争形态主要表现为以信息要素为主导的、以网信体系为中心的信息化战争。进入智能化时代，智能化技术将敌我对抗中的认知优势、决策优势和行动优势高度统一起来，实质是将物质、能量和信息三者高度统一，通过以智赋能、以智聚能、以智释能，形成了以智能要素为主导的、以智能算法为中心的智能化战争形态，主要表现形式即为反映智能化战争复杂体系对抗的耗散战。 具有坚实的哲学理论基础支撑。社会形态是战争形态的母体，探索和认识智能化战争，必须基于历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的基本原理，综合考察战争形态的演进和智能化战争所处的社会形态，构建新的战争概念和语境体系。从哲学角度看，物质、能量和信息是构成世界的三大要素，物质体现本源的存在，能量体现运动的存在，信息则体现联系的存在，三者递进交替主导着社会形态和战争形态的演进和运行。按照辩证唯物主义的否定之否定原理，在信息时代之后的智能时代，主导社会的要素将继物质、能量、信息后再次轮到物质，只不过这个物质是高度信息化后螺旋式上升后形成的新型物质，其主要特征就是具有了智能化技术属性。因此，从本质上讲，耗散战是智能要素将以前低阶战争形态中物质、能量和信息的特性优势高度统一起来，将战争中普遍存在的物质消耗、能量释散和信息扩散等形式高度统一起来，反映了智能化战争的典型特征。 深刻把握耗散战的内在要义 耗散战基于现实世界、涵盖虚拟世界，适应了智能化技术迅猛发展、非传统安全威胁兴起、战争主体和范畴不断拓展的趋势，呈现出许多新特性。 对抗综合博弈。随着智能化战争形态加速向更高深度和广度发展，政治、经济、文化、外交等领域相互联系和影响更具广泛性，战争重心开始从军事系统向社会系统偏移，战争利益攸关方的对抗将体现为政治较量、经济比拼、军事攻防、文化冲突和外交制衡等多种形式的综合博弈，追求的战争优势不再仅仅局限在军事对抗领域。战争制胜方必须适应战争体系的开放性、复杂性和涌现性要求，从单一物质、能量和信息的粗放式消耗和运用转变到以智能优势主导战争体系的耗散，力争在多领域的综合博弈中赢得主动和优势。 主体跨域多元。智能化战争的主体日趋泛化，传统战争需要动员的战争潜在力量将处于常态化对抗状态。政治力量、各类机构和人员与传统意义上在战场厮杀的部队和军人一起构成战争的主体。多元化战争主体将跨越现实域和虚拟域，出现在陆、海、空、天、电、心理等多个空间域，涵盖物理域、信息域、认知域等，覆盖政治、经济、文化、外交等多类社会域。如社会平民可以用智能手机收集军事战场上的信息并传递给战争利益攸关方，造成对战争关键信息的扩散，进而影响战争决策或者一场战役和战斗的胜败。 力量一体富聚。虚实力量一体。围绕战争目的，一切可能运用的现实力量和虚拟力量将在智能化技术支撑下实现一体化，在平行战场上按职履责、按规行动；有无力量一体。无人作战力量将在经历人工操作、人工授权、人为监督阶段后，实现高度的自主性，并可与各类有人力量按需部署、按需组合，在共同的战争规则约束下有效协同、并行共生；多方力量一体。基于各领域的广泛联系和战争体系的共同目的，党政军警民等各方力量将军事行动与政治、经济、外交、舆论、法理斗争密切配合、统一行动，形成综合战力。总之，在国家或政治集团的一体筹划下，智能化战争的多元参战力量虽然物理分散，但能够围绕共同的战争目的，实现逻辑集中、即时富聚，优势互补、一体聚优。 效能累积涌现。高阶战争形态在具有新质技术特征的同时，仍然涵括低阶战争形态的特征优势。耗散战强调在多域持续进行综合对抗，这既包括物质层面的弹药、物资、器材甚至作战人员的消耗，也包括能量层面的不断汇集和释放，更包括通过信息层面的数据、知识、算法等的扩散和融合，对人的思维认知、价值追求、道德观念、情感意志、行为模式等产生不可限量的影响。在核武器的常态威慑下，智能化战争呈现出血腥味下降，但政治孤立、经济封锁、文化冲突、外交扼杀等将更加严峻激烈的局面。当军事、政治、经济、文化、外交等各系统作用持续发挥，效能累积达到某一程度，战争体系就会增加负熵，进而实现战力突变和体系效能涌现，从而获得战争优势。 在选准作战重心中打好耗散战 智能化战争体系通过对内富聚融合，对外突变涌现，跨域增效、以智耗散，达成体系作战效能最大化，这是耗散战蕴含的制胜机理。要在智能化战争中赢得胜势，必须明确耗散战的作战重心，针对对手体系短板弱点，找准战争准备的发力点。 着眼体系开放性，封闭孤立对手战争体系。截断对手战争体系与外界战场环境的物质、能量和信息交流，使之缺乏物质、能量和信息来源渠道，逐渐走向孤立、封闭和虚弱状态。如在战略层面，采用政治孤立的方式，使对手战争体系处于孤立状态，造成体系熵增。在战役层面，可利用切断数据来源、毁灭数据备份、数据作假、篡改信息等方法，综合采用软硬手段，迫其战争体系向封闭状态转化，从而降低对方体系效能。 着眼体系复杂性，分域破击对手战争体系。智能化战争体系要素间联系越多、联系程度越紧密，体系结构可靠性就越低。运用复杂系统中各分层相对独立的原理，可制订战略全局、战役局部和战术行动策略，实现对敌战争体系的分层分域破击。如在战略层面，采用经济封锁的方式，大大削弱对手的战争实力和发展潜力。在战役层面，利用作战系统通信网络的脆弱性，以网电复合攻击为基本路径和手段，采用“毁端、击元、孤群、断网、破云”等方式，破击对方作战系统结构，促使对方战争体系“坍塌”。 着眼体系涌现性，拆解疏散对手战争体系。智能化战争体系只有出现突变和涌现效应，才能快速形成和发挥体系效能，获得耗散战优势。如果只是单个组分或者要素发挥作用，不可能形成优势涌现。可以预见，当前兴起的ChatGPT等技术以及未来更高级的智能化技术，将提供理解和发现战争复杂体系运行行为、状态和规律的全新思维方式，以及探知客观规律、改造自然和社会的新手段，战争对抗优势方将通过虚实结合、平行一体的对抗方式，降低对手战争体系的耦合度，达成拆解疏散敌战争体系的目的。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230509235919/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16222879.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230514153400/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16222879.html,2023-05-10 0:00:00,Dissipation Warfare: A Typical Approach to Intelligent Warfare Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Wang Ronghui Editor in Chief: Guo Yanfei 2023-05-09 07:11:48 0,"Dissipative Warfare: A Typical Way of Intelligent Warfare ■Wang Ronghui Introduction With the rapid development of intelligent technology and its wide application in the military, intelligent war is becoming a new form of war after informationized war, and dissipative warfare has become a typical way of intelligent war. The so-called dissipative warfare refers to the intelligent war system through the internal fusion and fusion, and the external mutation emergence, to achieve the comprehensive war power of material consumption, energy release and information diffusion in one of the combat modes. Strengthening the study of dissipative warfare is conducive to revealing the winning mechanism of intelligent warfare and winning the initiative of future war games. Dissipative warfare is the inevitable result of the development of the times Dissipative warfare is manifested in the integrated confrontation of the physical, information and cognitive domains in the era of intelligence, which is reflected in the high degree of unity in the forms of political competition, economic competition, military attack and defense, cultural conflict and diplomatic checks and balances, reflecting the openness, complexity and emergence of the intelligent war system. Adapt to the security situation requirements of the intelligent era. Entering the era of intelligence, wide networks, big data, big models, cloud computing, deep learning and other technologies are developing rapidly, and the links between political groups, countries and nations are more extensive. Under the role of multiple factors such as political pluralism, economic integration, social openness, and technological revolution, non-traditional security has emerged and intertwined with traditional threats, the subject and scope of intelligent war continue to expand, the time and space of war continue to expand, war and peace follow each other and are intertwined as one, and the war system will further transcend the local geographic limitations, move from relative closure to more openness, and form a higher level and wider scope of confrontation. Dissipation warfare emphasizes the importance of intelligent war systems. Dissipation war emphasizes the integrated power of intelligent war system in physical, information and cognitive domains, and highly unifies and integrates the forms of political competition, economic competition, military attack and defense, cultural conflict and diplomatic checks and balances into the scope of confrontation between the enemy and us, which is in line with the requirements of the development of the world security situation in the times. In line with the objective law of the evolution of war forms. Dissipation of the war system has always existed since the emergence of war, but before the emergence of intelligent war forms, due to technological constraints, has been in a relatively low-level, simple state, the war confrontation can only be manifested as a form of material consumption, energy dissipation and information diffusion. In the agricultural era, the war form mainly manifested itself as a cold weapon war dominated by material elements and centered on the human body. In the industrialization era, the war form is mainly manifested in the thermonuclear weapon and mechanization war which is dominated by energy elements and centered on platforms. In the age of informationization, the form of war is mainly manifested in the information war dominated by information elements and centered on the network and information system. Entering the era of intelligence, intelligent technology will highly unify the cognitive advantage, decision-making advantage and action advantage in the confrontation between the enemy and us, which is in essence a high degree of unity of matter, energy and information, and by empowering with intelligence, gathering energy with intelligence and releasing energy with intelligence, it has formed the form of intelligent war dominated by intelligent elements and centered on intelligent algorithms, and its main manifestation is the confrontation of complex systems reflecting intelligent war. Dissipative warfare. It is supported by a solid philosophical and theoretical foundation. Social form is the mother of war form, exploring and understanding intelligent war must be based on the basic principles of historical materialism and dialectical materialism, comprehensively examining the evolution of war form and the social form in which intelligent war is located, and constructing a new concept of war and context system. From a philosophical point of view, matter, energy and information are the three major elements constituting the world, with matter embodying the existence of origin, energy embodying the existence of movement, and information embodying the existence of connection, and the three alternately dominate the evolution and operation of the social form and war form. According to the principle of negation of negation of dialectical materialism, in the intelligent age after the information age, the elements of the dominant society will take the turn of matter again after matter, energy and information, only that this matter is a new type of matter formed after spiraling upward after a high degree of informatization, and its main characteristic is that it has the attribute of intelligent technology. Therefore, in essence, the dissipative war is the intelligent element that highly unifies the advantages of the characteristics of matter, energy and information in the previous low-order war form, and highly unifies the forms of material consumption, energy release and information diffusion that are commonly found in the war, reflecting the typical characteristics of the intelligent war. Deeply grasp the intrinsic essence of dissipative warfare Dissipative warfare is based on the real world and covers the virtual world, adapting to the rapid development of intelligent technology, the rise of non-traditional security threats, and the trend of expanding the main body and scope of the war, and presenting a lot of new characteristics. Confrontation integrated game. With the accelerated development of intelligent war forms to a higher depth and breadth, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic and other areas of interconnectedness and influence more extensive, the center of gravity of the war began to shift from the military system to the social system, the confrontation of war stakeholders will be embodied in the political competition, economic competition, military attack and defense, cultural conflict and diplomatic checks and balances and other forms of integrated game, the pursuit of war advantages are no longer limited to the field of military confrontation. The pursuit of war advantages is no longer limited to the field of military confrontation. The war winning party must adapt to the openness, complexity and emergence of the war system, and change from the crude consumption and application of single material, energy and information to the dissipation of the war system dominated by intelligent advantages, and strive to win the initiative and advantages in the comprehensive game of multiple fields. The main body of the cross-domain diversification. The subject of intelligent war is becoming increasingly generalized, and the potential forces of war that need to be mobilized for traditional war will be in a constant state of confrontation. Political forces, various types of institutions and personnel and the traditional sense of the battlefield fighting troops and soldiers together constitute the main body of the war. Diversified war subjects will cross the real and virtual domains, appearing in multiple spatial domains such as land, sea, air, space, electricity, psychology, etc., covering physical, information and cognitive domains, etc., as well as multiple types of social domains such as politics, economy, culture and diplomacy. For example, social civilians can use smartphones to collect information on the military battlefield and pass it on to war stakeholders, resulting in the proliferation of critical information about the war, which in turn affects war decision-making or the success or failure of a campaign or battle. The force is one and rich. The virtual and real forces are one. Around the purpose of the war, all the real and virtual forces that may be used will be integrated under the support of intelligent technology, and will perform their duties and act according to regulations on the parallel battlefield; there is no force as one. Unmanned combat forces will realize a high degree of autonomy after going through the stages of manual operation, manual authorization and human supervision, and can be deployed and combined with all kinds of manned forces on demand, and effectively synergize and coexist in parallel under the constraints of common rules of war; and multi-party forces as one. Based on the extensive connection of various fields and the common purpose of the war system, the party, government, military, police and people and other forces will closely coordinate and unify military action with political, economic, diplomatic, public opinion and legal struggle to form an integrated war power. In short, under the integrated planning of the state or political group, although the multiple participating forces of intelligent war are physically dispersed, they are able to realize logical concentration, instant enrichment, complementary advantages, and integration of excellence around the common purpose of war. Cumulative emergence of effectiveness. Higher-order war forms still include the characteristic advantages of lower-order war forms while possessing new technological characteristics. Dissipative warfare emphasizes continuous comprehensive confrontation in multiple domains, which includes the consumption of ammunition, materials, equipment and even combatants at the material level, as well as the continuous pooling and release of energy at the energy level, and even more so through the diffusion and integration of data, knowledge and algorithms at the information level, which will have unlimited influence on people's thinking, cognition, pursuit of values, moral concepts, emotions and wills, and behavioral modes, and so on. Under the standing deterrence of nuclear weapons, intelligent warfare presents a situation in which the taste of blood declines, but political isolation, economic blockade, cultural conflict, diplomatic strangulation, etc. will become more severe and intense. When the military, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic and other systems continue to play a role, the effectiveness of the cumulative to a certain extent, the war system will increase the negative entropy, and then realize the war power mutation and system effectiveness emergence, so as to obtain the war advantage. In the selection of combat center of gravity to play a good dissipation war intelligent war system through the internal fusion of fusion, external mutation emergence, cross-domain efficiency, to wisdom dissipation, to achieve the system combat effectiveness maximization, which is the dissipation of war implies the mechanism of victory. In order to win in the intelligent war, we must clarify the center of gravity of the combat of the dissipation war, targeting the weakness of the opponent's system short boards, and find the point of strength of the war preparations. Focus on the openness of the system, close and isolate the opponent's war system. Cut off the material, energy and information exchanges between the opponent's war system and the external battlefield environment, so that it lacks material, energy and information source channels, and gradually moves towards isolation, closure and weakness. For example, at the strategic level, political isolation is used to keep the adversary's war system in an isolated state, resulting in the entropy increase of the system. At the battle level, we can cut off the source of data, destroy data backup, data forgery, tampering with information and other methods, using a combination of soft and hard means, forcing its war system to a closed state, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the other party's system. Focusing on the complexity of the system, the sub-domain breaks the opponent's war system. The more links between elements of the intelligent war system, the closer the links, the lower the reliability of the system structure. By applying the principle of relative independence of each stratum in a complex system, we can formulate strategic overall, battle local and tactical action strategies to realize a stratified and sub-domain breakthrough of the enemy's war system. For example, at the strategic level, the use of economic blockade, greatly weakening the opponent's war strength and development potential. At the battle level, utilizing the vulnerability of the communication network of the combat system, taking the net-electricity composite attack as the basic path and means, and adopting the methods of ""destroying the end, hitting the yuan, lone group, disconnecting the network, breaking the cloud"", etc., to break the structure of the other party's combat system, and prompting the other party's war system to ""collapse"". The other side's war system will be ""collapsed"". Focusing on the emergence of the system, dismantle and evacuate the opponent's war system. Intelligent war system can only form and play system effectiveness and gain advantages in dissipation war if there is mutation and emergence effect. If only a single component or element plays a role, it is impossible to form an advantageous emergence. It can be foreseen that the current rise of ChatGPT and other technologies, as well as more advanced intelligent technologies in the future, will provide a new way of thinking to understand and discover the behavior, state and law of operation of the complex system of war, as well as new means of probing the objective laws and transforming nature and society, and the superior party of the confrontation of the war will reduce the coupling degree of the rival's war system by combining the real with the virtual and the parallel, and reach the goal of dismantling and evacuating the enemy's war system.

着力增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：赵 忠 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-05-08 11:35:04 0,习主席在党的二十大报告中强调的“增强党组织政治功能和组织功能”，是深入推进新时代党的建设新的伟大工程的重点任务之一。军队党组织是党的组织体系的重要组成部分，是决定军队战斗力生成的重要因素。我军是党绝对领导下的人民军队，广大官兵要深刻领悟增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能的重要意义，牢牢把握增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能的着力点，使人民军队始终在党的领导下阔步前进。 一 党的力量来自组织，组织强则军队强。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，对于确保党对军队的绝对领导、确保人民军队有效履行新时代使命任务，具有十分重要的意义。 从理论维度看，这是马克思主义建党学说的重要原则。重视组织建设是马克思主义政党的鲜明特征。科学的组织，是马克思主义政党力量凝聚的可靠依托。马克思指出，只有当工人通过组织而联合起来并获得知识的指导时，人数才能起举足轻重的作用。列宁说：“无产阶级在争取政权的斗争中，除了组织，没有别的武器。”我们党诞生之前，中国的各种政治力量“你方唱罢我登场”，却始终未能挽救国家危亡的命运，一个重要原因就在于缺乏一个坚强有力的组织，以正确的政治方向、强大的组织功能将所有进步力量紧紧凝聚在一起。我们党一经诞生，就把马克思主义鲜明写在自己的旗帜上，注重从思想上政治上组织上引领人、凝聚人，带领人民找到了实现民族独立、人民解放和国家富强、人民幸福的正确道路。 从历史维度看，这是人民军队栉风沐雨成长壮大的基因密码。人民军队的成长壮大史，蕴藏着一部军队党组织的创立发展史。我军在残酷的武装斗争实践中，逐步探索出“在军队中建立党的组织”“支部建在连上”“思想建党、政治建军”等党对军队绝对领导的一系列原则和制度，在军队内部建立起严密的党组织体系。古田会议召开后，“我军要建立一支什么样的军队，就定型了”。一路走来，人民军队面对各种考验而不变色，历经艰难困苦而不溃散，不断从胜利走向胜利。 从现实维度看，这是新时代改革强军转型重塑的有力支撑。党的十八大以来，在党中央、中央军委和习主席坚强领导下，人民军队全面实施改革强军战略，推进力度之大、触及利益之深、影响范围之广前所未有。面对这场攻坚战，军队各级党组织闻令而动、听令景从，以管班子、管党员、管干部、管思想的强大功能，教育引导广大官兵把拥护改革、支持改革、投身改革作为维护核心的实际行动，以坚强的党性、高度的觉悟、振奋的精神把各项改革任务完成好，向党和人民交出优异答卷。 从远景维度看，这是实现建军一百年奋斗目标的可靠保证。如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标，加快把人民军队建成世界一流军队，是人民军队必须扛起的时代重任、交出的历史答卷。旗帜引领方向，组织凝聚力量。实现建军一百年奋斗目标，必须始终坚持党对军队的绝对领导，不断增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，充分发挥党委领导作用、基层党组织战斗堡垒作用和党员先锋模范作用，使党的领导“如身使臂，如臂使指”，把我军凝结成一个牢不可破、无坚不摧的战斗集体。 二 增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，要更加注重政治统领、思想引领、组织凝聚、风气营造，切实把党的政治优势和组织优势转化为制胜优势。 更加注重政治统领。我们党在创建和领导人民军队的伟大实践中，历来注重从思想上政治上建设军队。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，必须深刻把握我军的政治属性，始终坚持党对军队的绝对领导，坚定不移培塑政治信仰，用崇高的政治信仰贯注官兵，锻造官兵听党话、跟党走的政治品格；坚定不移铸牢政治忠诚，教育引导广大官兵把对党忠诚融入血脉骨髓、浸入灵魂深处，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，不断增强忠诚核心、拥戴核心、维护核心、捍卫核心的政治自觉、思想自觉、行动自觉，确保部队绝对忠诚、绝对纯洁、绝对可靠；坚定不移推进政治整训，持之以恒正风肃纪反腐，深入纠治“四个不纯”“七个弱化”等问题，确保我军政治上永远过硬，确保枪杆子永远不生锈、永远不变质。 更加注重思想引领。从思想上感召人、培塑人、凝聚人，是我军党的建设的一条重要经验。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，必须用党的创新理论贯注部队、铸魂育人。体系抓灌输，运用党委（党组）理论学习中心组学习、干部轮训、理论宣讲等方式提升理论学习质效，推进党的创新理论走进基层、掌握官兵；深度抓改造，教育引导广大官兵深刻感悟党的创新理论的思想魅力、真理伟力，筑牢信仰之基、补足精神之钙、把稳思想之舵；切实抓武装，教育引导广大官兵在真信笃行、知行合一上下功夫，把自己摆进去、把职责摆进去、把工作摆进去，做到学思用贯通、知信行统一，把学习成效转化为坚定的政治信念、过硬的政治本领。 更加注重组织凝聚。坚强有力的党组织，是我军的优势所在、力量所在。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，必须锻造坚强的军队党组织体系。全面健全组织设置，系统织密组织网络，突出加强任务中党组织建设研究，确保组织领导层级合理、结构严密、体系覆盖；全面规范组织运行，针对不同类型的党组织，坚持依规设置、理顺关系、明确权责，构建利于备战、便于管理的组织设置运行模式；全面锻造组织堡垒，树牢问题导向，坚持靶向发力，不断强化各级党组织的领导力、组织力、执行力，切实依靠组织统一思想、统一意志、统一行动。 更加注重风气营造。军队党组织能不能引领人、凝聚人，很重要的一条要看是否法治严、风气正。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，必须把全面从严治党贯穿始终，持续深化自我革命。夯实教育引领，理论武装、案例警示、文化熏陶综合发力，引领广大官兵勤掸思想之尘，自觉做到明是非、知进退、有取舍；严格纪律规矩，落实中央八项规定精神、军委十项规定及其实施细则精神，把纪律建设摆在更加突出位置，强化广大官兵知敬畏、存戒惧、守底线的纪律自觉；严格党内监督，强化“熔炉”功能，坚持从交党费、过党日、上党课等基本要求抓起，常态化开展批评和自我批评，切实把军队各级党组织锻造成一块坚硬的钢铁。 三 群雁高飞头雁领。增强军队党组织政治功能和组织功能，要求军队党员领导干部发挥好示范作用，身体力行、以上率下，带动广大官兵团结一心、奋力推进新时代强军事业。 深化理论武装，铸牢忠诚之魂。理论上的认同是最根本的认同，思想上的追随是最内在的追随。军队党员领导干部要带头深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，突出学好习近平强军思想，掌握蕴含其中的世界观方法论，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，贯彻军委主席负责制，带领部队和官兵在思想上政治上行动上始终与党中央、中央军委和习主席保持高度一致。 贯彻群众路线，充分尊重官兵。坚持走群众路线，是党组织增强政治功能、彰显组织功能的重要途径。军队党员领导干部要坚持用信任的眼光、欣赏的眼光、发展的眼光看待广大官兵，充分尊重官兵的主体地位和首创精神，虚心听取他们的意见和建议，把蕴藏于他们之中的丰富智慧和巨大力量充分激发出来，真正在深入官兵、融入官兵中充分发挥党组织教育人、培塑人、凝聚人的强大功能。 坚持问题导向，弘扬斗争精神。要增强党内政治生活的战斗性，使每个党组织都成为激浊扬清的战斗堡垒，使每名党员都成为扶正祛邪的战斗员。军队党员领导干部要带头以斗争精神用好批评和自我批评武器，既刀刃向内主动解剖自己，又本着对单位、对组织、对同志高度负责的精神及时扯袖提醒，切实巩固党的团结统一、增强党组织战斗力。 严守纪律规矩，涵养廉洁品格。风清气正是发挥党组织政治功能和组织功能的重要保障。军队党员领导干部要永葆赶考的清醒和坚定，做到自我革命意识永远在“心”上，自我革命担当永远在“肩”上，自我革命状态永远在“弦”上，自我革命标准永远在“严”上，廉洁从政、廉洁用权、廉洁齐家，以“关键少数”带动“绝大多数”，营造风清气正的党内政治生态。 （作者单位：黑龙江省军区）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230509235919/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16222679.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230508042410/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16222679.html,2023-05-10 0:00:00,Efforts to Enhance the Political and Organizational Functions of Military Party Organizations Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zhao Zhong Editor-in-Chief: Li Jiaqi 2023-05-08 11:35:04 0,"""Enhancing the political and organizational functions of Party organizations"", as emphasized by President Xi in the report of the twentieth Party Congress, is one of the key tasks in furthering the new great project of Party construction in the new era. The Party organization of the army is an important part of the Party's organizational system, and is an important factor in determining the generation of the army's combat power. Our army is the people's army under the absolute leadership of the party, the majority of officers and soldiers should deeply understand the significance of the enhancement of the political function of the army party organization and organizational function, firmly grasp the enhancement of the political function of the party organization of the army and organizational function of the focus, so that the people's army has always been in the leadership of the party to stride forward. The strength of the Party comes from the organization, and a strong organization makes a strong army. Enhancing the political and organizational functions of the party organizations of the army is of great significance in ensuring the absolute leadership of the party over the army and ensuring that the people's army effectively fulfills its mission and tasks in the new era. From the theoretical dimension, this is an important principle of the Marxist doctrine of party building. Attaching importance to organizational construction is a distinctive feature of Marxist political parties. A scientific organization is a reliable support for the cohesion of the power of Marxist political parties. Marx pointed out that only when workers are united through organization and are guided by knowledge can numbers play a pivotal role. Lenin said, ""The proletariat has no other weapon in its struggle for power than organization."" Before the birth of the Party, various political forces in China had been ""singing their own songs, but they had never been able to save the country from its perilous fate. One important reason for this was the lack of a strong and powerful organization that could tightly unite all the forces of progress with a correct political direction and strong organizational functions. As soon as our Party was born, we wrote Marxism distinctly on our flag, focused on ideologically and politically organizing to lead and unite people, and led the people to find the right path to achieve national independence, people's liberation, national prosperity and people's happiness. From the historical dimension, this is the genetic code of the people's army's growth and development in the wind and rain. The history of the growth and development of the people's army contains a history of the creation and development of the party organization of the army. In the practice of brutal armed struggle, our army gradually explored a series of principles and systems of the Party's absolute leadership of the army, such as ""establishing Party organizations in the army"", ""building branches on companies"", ""building the Party on the basis of ideology and building the army on the basis of politics"", etc. In the past few years, the Party had established a series of principles and systems of absolute leadership of the army. A series of principles and systems of absolute leadership of the Party over the army were established, and a strict system of Party organizations was set up within the army. After the Gutian Conference was held, ""what kind of army we want to build has been finalized"". Along the way, the People's Army has faced all kinds of tests without discoloration, endured hardships without collapse, and continuously moved from victory to victory. From the realistic dimension, this is a new era of reform and strong army transformation and remodeling of strong support. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi, the People's Army has comprehensively implemented the strategy of reforming and strengthening the military, and the intensity of the push, the depth of the interests touched, and the scope of influence is unprecedented. In the face of this battle, the party organizations at all levels of the army move on orders, listen to orders from the powerful function of the management team, party members, cadres and ideology, educate and guide the vast number of officers and soldiers to embrace the reform, support the reform, and participate in the reform as a practical action to safeguard the core, with a strong party spirit, a high degree of awareness, and invigorated spirit of the reform tasks to complete the task well to the party and the people to hand over an excellent answer sheet. From the perspective of the visionary dimension, this is a reliable guarantee for realizing the goal of building the army for one hundred years. To realize the goal of building the army for 100 years as scheduled, and to accelerate the building of the people's army into a world-class army, the people's army must shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times and hand over the historical answer sheet. The flag leads the direction, and the organization unites the strength. To achieve the goal of one hundred years of the army, we must always adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, constantly enhance the political and organizational functions of the Party organizations of the army, give full play to the leadership role of the Party committees, the role of the grass-roots Party organizations as battlefields, and the role of Party members as vanguards, so that the Party's leadership is ""like a body that makes the arm and the arm that makes the finger"", and the army will be condensed into an unbreakable, indestructible and indestructible force. The Party's leadership is ""like an arm in the body, like a finger in the arm"", and the army is consolidated into an unbreakable and indestructible fighting collective. Enhance the political function and organizational function of the army party organization, to pay more attention to political leadership, ideological leadership, organizational cohesion, ethos creation, and effectively transform the party's political and organizational advantages into a winning advantage. Pay more attention to political leadership. In the great practice of creating and leading the people's army, our party has always focused on building the army ideologically and politically. Enhance the political function and organizational function of the party organization of the army, we must deeply grasp the political attributes of the army, always adhere to the absolute leadership of the party over the army, unswervingly cultivate political beliefs, with lofty political beliefs through the officers and soldiers, forging the officers and soldiers to listen to the party, follow the party's political character; unswervingly casting a firm political loyalty, educating and guiding the majority of the officers and soldiers to the party's loyalty to the bone marrow into the blood and bone marrow, into the depths of their souls, and profoundly understand the ""two establishments"", ""the two establishments"". The decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", and constantly enhance the political, ideological and operational self-awareness of the core of loyalty, adherence to the core, maintenance of the core, defense of the core, to ensure that the troops are absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, absolutely reliable; unswervingly promote the political rectification of the training, and persevere in correcting the winds and purging the discipline and anti-corruption, and in-depth corrective treatment of the ""four impure"", ""four impure"" and ""four impure"". ""Four impure"", ""seven weakening"" and other issues, to ensure that our military politics will always be hard, to ensure that the barrel of the gun will never rust, never deteriorate. Pay more attention to thought leadership. From the ideological appeal of people, molding people, cohesion, is an important experience in the construction of the party of our army. Enhance the political function and organizational function of the army party organization, must use the party's innovative theory to infuse the troops, casting the soul and educating people.

Pay more attention to organizational cohesion. Strong and powerful party organization is the advantage of our army, where the strength lies. Enhance the political function and organizational function of the army party organization, must forge a strong army party organization system. Comprehensively improve the organizational setup, systematically weave a dense organizational network, highlighting the strengthening of the task of party organization construction research, to ensure that the organizational leadership level is reasonable, strict structure, system coverage; comprehensively regulate the operation of the organization, for different types of party organizations, adhere to the rules set up, rationalize the relationship, clear powers and responsibilities, build the organizational setup and operation mode conducive to preparation for war, easy to manage; comprehensively forging the organizational bastion, firmly problem-oriented, adhere to the Targeted force, and constantly strengthen the leadership, organization and execution of party organizations at all levels, and effectively rely on the organization to unify thought, will and action. Pay more attention to the creation of atmosphere. The army party organization can lead people, cohesion, a very important one to see whether the rule of law is strict, the ethos is correct. Enhance the political function and organizational function of the army party organization, we must put the overall strict governance throughout, and continue to deepen the self-revolution. Compact education and leadership, theoretical armament, case warning, cultural inculcation comprehensive force, leading the majority of officers and soldiers diligently dust of thought, consciously to do clear right and wrong, know the progress and retreat, there are trade-offs; strict discipline, the implementation of the spirit of the Central Committee's eight provisions, the spirit of the Military Commission's ten provisions and its implementing rules, the construction of discipline in a more prominent position, to strengthen the majority of officers and soldiers to know the fear, the existence of fear, to abide by the bottom line of the disciplinary self-consciousness; strict supervision, strengthen ""melting pot"", the Party Strict intra-party supervision, strengthen the function of the ""furnace"", adhere to the basic requirements from the payment of party fees, party days, party classes, regularization of criticism and self-criticism, and effectively forging the party organizations at all levels of the army into a piece of hardened steel.

The ""Thirteen Achievements"" provide a panoramic view of the Party's philosophy of governance, achievements and experience in the new era, which are both the result of the guidance of this idea and the enrichment and development of this idea with original achievements. The three are integrated with each other and organically unified, setting the orientation, pointing out the direction, clarifying the strategy and making good plans for the great practice of the new era.

This thought is consistent with Marxist philosophy, Marxist political economy, and scientific socialism, embodies the inner unity of the road, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and reflects the organic unity of the theoretical logic, historical logic, and practical logic of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should grasp the scientific system of this thought as a whole, and the new concepts, ideas and strategies put forward in various fields, and the specific requirements put forward in various aspects of work should be put in the whole scientific system to understand and grasp, so as to avoid fragmentation and one-sidedness.

We should accurately grasp the worldview and methodology of this thought, and adhere to and utilize the position and viewpoint methodology that runs through it. To achieve the unity of adhering to the Party's leadership and the people's supremacy. The people's position is the fundamental position of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era. ""Must adhere to the supremacy of the people"" ranks first among the ""six must adhere to"", fully proving that this thought is a scientific theory from the people, for the people, and for the benefit of the people.

Adherence to the people's supremacy reflects the nature and purpose of our party, and adherence to party leadership is the choice of history and the people. As revolutionary soldiers in the new era, we should deeply grasp the scientific connotation and inner connection of the two, constantly strengthen the awareness of the military soul and the sense of purpose, adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, bear in mind the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, consolidate and develop the unity between the military and the government, the military and the people, so that the people's army has always become a heroic army that the Party and the people can fully rely on.

The ambitious goal of building a strong nation and rejuvenating the nation is encouraging and inspiring, but the enormity and complexity of the problems we will face in the future have also increased significantly. We need to anchor this grand goal, both the real study of the problem and the study of the real problem, to crack the problem with a real grasp, rely on practical work to realize the dream, in the attack on the difficulties to move forward, in order to comprehensively build a strong socialist modernization, comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to make a new and greater contribution. Do adhere to the unity of carrying forward the tradition and pioneering innovation. The greater the cause, the more fraught with difficulties and obstacles, the more need to adhere to the dialectical unity of change and unchanged, inheritance and development, to keep the right and innovation.

学习当代中国马克思主义军事观和方法论：坚持政治引领 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：刘光明 王强 彭春淋 责任编辑：张硕 2023-05-10 07:08:48 0,习近平强军思想，坚持用马克思主义审视当代中国军事问题，深刻阐述军事与政治、战争与和平、发展与安全、稳局与塑势、威慑与实战、人与武器等重大关系，为我们在新时代认识把握国防和军队建设规律、军事斗争准备规律、战争指导规律提供了锐利武器。主要体现为“五个坚持”：坚持政治引领，坚持以武止戈，坚持积极进取，坚持统筹兼顾，坚持敢打必胜。从今天起，本版陆续刊发“五个坚持”系列学习文章，同广大读者一起深入领悟当代中国马克思主义军事观和方法论。 ——编　者 坚持政治引领 ——学习当代中国马克思主义军事观和方法论 ■国防大学习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心 党的十八大以来，习主席运用马克思主义立场观点方法思考把握政治与军事的辩证统一关系，抓住其中起决定性作用的主要方面，始终强调政治引领，对于我们党统筹推进政治与军事的良性互动具有重要意义。 深刻认识“坚持政治引领”的深层逻辑 军事服从政治、战略服从政略。“坚持政治引领”居于“五个坚持”之首，起着统摄作用。我们必须从政治高度深化对“坚持政治引领”的理解和认识。 军队的本质属性根源于政治。马克思主义认为，军队是阶级统治的工具，具有鲜明的阶级性。对于一个阶级、民族或国家而言，建设一支什么样的军队、这支军队走什么样的道路，都是由这个阶级、民族或国家的政治决定的。古罗马的禁卫军、英国的远征军、美国的太平洋舰队……世界各国的军队都是政治工具，始终为实现政治目的服务。从克劳塞维茨“战争是政治的继续”，到马克思和恩格斯“把每次战争都看作是有关列强（及其内部各阶级）在当时的政治的继续”；从列宁“辩证法的基本原理运用在战争上就是：战争不过是政治通过另一种（即暴力的）手段的继续”，到毛泽东“政治是不流血的战争，战争是流血的政治”……这些都深刻揭示了战争和军事的政治本质。 军队的根本职能取决于政治。政治对军队本质属性的内在规定，集中体现在军队对根本职能的履行上。我军是中国共产党缔造和领导的人民军队，从成立之日起就以党的宗旨为宗旨，以党的旗帜为旗帜，以党的目标为目标，以党的意志为意志，始终是执行革命政治任务的武装集团。在党的绝对领导下，我军履行职能使命的各个方面和环节都被纳入政治的顶层设计，军事安全是置于国家安全的大体系中统筹强化的，国防和军队现代化是置于中国式现代化的大布局中统筹协调的，国防和军队改革是置于国家全面深化改革的大盘子中统筹深化的，科技强军是置于国家创新驱动发展的大战略中统筹联动的，依法治军是置于全面依法治国的大设计中统筹落实的。 军队的行动决策考量于政治。战争作为流血的政治，判断其胜利与否的基本准绳在于是否达成政治目标。这就要求军事行动的决策者和执行者既要有军事头脑更要有政治头脑，在考虑如何打军事仗时，要考虑如何打好政治仗、经济仗、外交仗，考虑军事行动所产生的政治、经济、外交后果，考虑怎样才能最大限度契合国家和民族的战略利益。特别是在政治和军事联系更加紧密的时代条件下，政治因素对战争的影响和制约愈发突出，军事斗争的政治性、政策性、敏感性日益增强，就更需要从政治高度筹划军事行动。军事战略的制定与实施必须着眼国家政治外交大局和国家安全战略全局，军事上打还是不打、什么时候打、怎么打、打到什么程度，都要有大局和全局上的考量。 科学把握“坚持政治引领”的辩证法意蕴 “五个坚持”蕴含着科学的立场观点方法，深化了我们党对军事领域一些基本问题的规律性认识。我们应科学把握“坚持政治引领”的辩证法意蕴，防止学习贯彻时断章取义、割裂歪曲、片面极端等倾向，避免知其一而不知其二，知其然而不知其所以然。 坚持政治与军事的辩证统一。“坚持政治引领”，言简意赅，意蕴深厚。我们既要深刻理解“凡战法必本于政胜”的哲理，牢牢把握政治决定军事、政略决定战略的大逻辑，同时也要敏锐意识到“国家大柄，莫重于兵”的道理，绝不能忽视军事的极端重要作用。宋代实行弱兵政策，虽防范了内乱，但面对南侵的游牧民族却抵抗乏力，总是打败仗，300多年间遭受了许多屈辱，当引为镜鉴。当然，也不能反过来走到另一个极端，搞“单纯军事观点”那一套。 坚持引领与支撑的辩证统一。政治决定军事、引领军事，军事服务政治、支撑政治，这两个方面相辅相成、有机统一。一个强国的强大军事实力，绝不只是创造国家的“安全产品”，还能发挥其对国家整体实力和竞争力的战略支撑作用，大大提升国家的政治力、经济力、文化力和外交力，使其在许多方面获得更多战略主动和更大利益。这是强大军事实力产生的巨大综合性溢出效应。简言之，政治上的许多胜算，很多时候可以通过强军胜战来实现和保障。新征程上，我们要全面建成社会主义现代化强国，必须有世界一流军队做坚强战略支撑。 坚持守正与创新的辩证统一。“坚持政治引领”体现的是党和人民的意志，展现为政治上作出的重大判断和决策，为各领域的实践指明前进的方向和道路，也划出了不能逾越的底线和不可突破的红线。我们必须坚持守正，这样才能不迷失方向、不犯颠覆性错误。同时要看到，离开了创新，守正就失去了活力。要把坚定性与灵活性统一起来，对党中央、中央军委和习主席作出的决策部署必须无条件执行，确保不偏向、不变通、不走样，同时又要切合实际作出创新创造，确保党中央、中央军委和习主席的战略意图真正落地落实，使“政治引领”转化为新时代强军事业的累累硕果和大好局面。 全面落实“坚持政治引领”的原则要求 党的十八大以来，在党中央、中央军委和习主席的坚强领导下，人民军队炼忠诚之纯、补精神之钙、肃作风之弊、除军中之蠹、固打赢之基……一次次思想整队、精神洗礼，引领人民军队重整行装再出发。新征程上，我们要全面落实“坚持政治引领”的原则要求，推动强军事业迈上新台阶，实现新跨越。 必须坚持党对军队绝对领导。要全面加强人民军队党的建设，确保枪杆子永远听党指挥。新征程上，人民军队必须把党指挥枪这个命根子紧抓不放，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，贯彻军委主席负责制，不断提高政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力，在思想上政治上行动上始终与党中央、中央军委和习主席保持高度一致，做到在任何时候任何情况下都坚决听从党中央、中央军委和习主席指挥。 必须全心全意为人民服务。要始终站稳人民立场，践行全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨，永远做人民的子弟兵。始终同人民站在一起，继续发扬服务人民的光荣传统，秉持热爱人民的价值追求，传承人民军队的红色基因，保持同人民群众水乳交融、生死与共的关系。牢记为人民扛枪、为人民打仗的神圣职责，踔厉奋发精武，笃行不怠练兵，全面提高新时代练兵备战水平和打赢能力，以硬核本领坚决保卫人民和平劳动和生活，始终做党和人民完全可以信赖的英雄军队。积极参加和支援地方经济社会建设，勇于承担急难险重任务，以实际行动为人民造福兴利，巩固发展军政军民团结，让人民军队的根脉深深植于人民的沃土之中。 必须始终从政治高度思考和处理军事问题。要把实现中华民族伟大复兴作为国家和民族的最高利益，把国防和军队建设放在实现中华民族伟大复兴这个大目标下来认识和推进，把军事斗争作为进行伟大斗争的重要方面来运筹，避免出现战略性失误。要始终围绕政治目的筹划指导战争，把握政治因素对战争的影响制约，着眼政治形势选择作战时机，对任何军事行动都进行政治态势预判、战争风险评估、全局效益考虑，根据政治需要实施军事行动。 必须忠实履行党和人民赋予的使命任务。要把握新时代国家安全战略需求，以更强大的能力、更可靠的手段维护国家主权、安全和发展利益。坚定站在党的旗帜下，坚决维护国家政权安全、制度安全，坚决维护政治和社会大局稳定；做好随时打硬仗的准备，坚定灵活开展军事斗争，有效应对外部军事挑衅，坚决捍卫国家核心利益；不断增强在更广阔的空间遂行多样化军事任务能力；适应服务构建人类命运共同体的战略要求，积极履行同我国国际地位相称的责任和义务，为维护和平的国际环境和周边环境发挥更大作用。 （执笔：刘光明、王  强、彭春淋）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230513000128/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16223161.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230514153742/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16223161.html,2023-05-13 0:00:00,Learning Contemporary Chinese Marxist Military Concepts and Methodologies: Adhering to Political Leadership Source: china military network - PLA Daily Author: Liu Guangming Wang Qiang Peng Chunlin Editor-in-Chief: Zhang Shuo 2023-05-10 07:08:48 0,"Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military adheres to the Marxist approach to examining contemporary Chinese military issues, and profoundly elaborates on the major relationships between the military and politics, war and peace, development and security, stabilization and shaping, deterrence and combat, and people and weapons, providing us with a sharp weapon for understanding and grasping the laws of national defense and military construction, preparation for military struggles, and guidance for war in the new era. The main embodiment of the ""five adherence"": adhere to the political leadership, adhere to the military to stop the war, adhere to the positive and progressive, adhere to the overall coordination, and adhere to the dare to fight and win. Starting from today, this edition will publish a series of articles on the ""Five Insistences"" to help readers understand the military concept and methodology of contemporary Chinese Marxism. --The first is a series of articles on the ""five perspectives"" of contemporary Chinese Marxism on military affairs and methodology. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, President Xi has used the Marxist position and viewpoint method to consider the dialectical and unified relationship between politics and the military, grasping the main aspect that plays a decisive role in it, and always emphasizing political leadership, which is of great significance for the Party to promote the benign interaction between politics and the military. Deeply understand the deep logic of ""insisting on political leadership"", military is subordinate to politics, strategy is subordinate to political strategy. ""Adherence to political leadership"" is at the top of the ""five adherences"" and plays a unifying role. We must deepen our understanding and knowledge of ""adhere to political leadership"" from a high political level. The essential attributes of the army are rooted in politics. Marxism believes that the army is a tool of class rule, with a distinct class nature. For a class, nation or country, what kind of army to build and what kind of road to take are determined by the politics of the class, nation or country. The ancient Roman Praetorian Guard, the British Expeditionary Force, and the U.S. Pacific Fleet ...... The armies of all the countries of the world are all political tools, and they have always served to realize their political purposes. From Clausewitz, ""war is the continuation of politics"", to Marx and Engels, ""every war is regarded as a continuation of the politics of the powers (and classes within them) concerned at the time""; from Lenin, ""the basic principle of dialectics is applied to war. From Lenin's ""The basic principle of dialectics applied to war is that it is but a continuation of politics by another (i.e., violent) means"" to Mao Zedong's ""Politics is war without bloodshed, and war is politics with bloodshed."" ...... all of these profoundly reveal the political nature of war and military affairs. reveal the political nature of war and the military. The fundamental function of the military depends on politics. The intrinsic provisions of politics on the essential attributes of the army are centrally embodied in the army's fulfillment of its fundamental functions. Our army is a people's army founded and led by the Communist Party of China; from the day of its founding, it has taken the Party's purpose as its purpose, the Party's flag as its flag, the Party's goal as its goal, and the Party's will as its will, and it has always been an armed group carrying out the political tasks of the revolution. Under the absolute leadership of the Party, all aspects and links of our army's performance of its functions and missions have been incorporated into the top-level design of politics; military security is placed in the general system of national security to be strengthened in an integrated manner; modernization of the national defense and the army is placed in the general layout of Chinese-style modernization to be coordinated in an integrated manner; reform of the national defense and the army is placed in the general plate of the country's comprehensive deepening of reform to be deepened in an integrated manner; and strengthening of the army through science and technology is placed in the general strategy of national innovation-driven development to be coordinated and linked up. The reform of national defense and the army is placed in the overall deepening of the country's comprehensive deepening of reform, the strengthening of the army in science and technology is placed in the national innovation-driven development strategy, and the ruling of the army according to law is placed in the overall implementation of the comprehensive rule of law. The army's operational decisions are based on political considerations. War is a bloodshed of politics, and the basic criterion for judging its victory lies in whether or not it achieves its political goals. This requires that the decision-makers and executors of military operations should be more politically minded than militarily minded, and that when considering how to fight military battles, they should consider how to fight political, economic, and diplomatic battles, the political, economic, and diplomatic consequences of military operations, and how to maximize the strategic interests of the state and the nation. Especially in the era of closer political and military ties, the influence and constraints of political factors on the war are more and more prominent, and the political, policy and sensitivity of the military struggle are increasing, it is even more necessary to plan military operations from a political height. The formulation and implementation of military strategy must focus on the national political and diplomatic situation and the overall situation of national security strategy, the military fight or not, when to fight, how to fight, to what extent, there should be the overall situation and the overall consideration. Scientific grasp of ""adhere to the political leadership"" of the dialectical implications of the ""five adhere to"" contains a scientific position and viewpoint method, deepening the Party's understanding of the regularity of some basic issues in the military field. We should scientifically grasp the dialectical implications of ""adhere to the political leadership"" to prevent the tendency to learn and implement out of context, cut and distort, one-sided and extreme, to avoid knowing one without knowing the other, and knowing what is true without knowing why. Adhere to the dialectical unity of political and military. ""Adhere to the political leadership"", simple and concise, profound meaning. We not only need to deeply understand the philosophy of ""where the law of war must be based on political victory"", firmly grasp the political decision military, political strategy to determine the logic of the strategy, but also be keenly aware of the ""national handle, no heavier than the military"" reasoning, must not ignore the extremely important role of the military. The military must not be neglected. Song Dynasty, the implementation of the policy of weak soldiers, although the prevention of civil unrest, but the face of southern invasion of nomads but weak resistance, always defeated, more than 300 years suffered a lot of humiliation, should be cited as a lesson. Of course, can not go to the other extreme, engage in ""purely military point of view"" that set. Adhere to the dialectical unity of leading and supporting. Politics determines the military, leading the military, military service politics, support politics, these two aspects complement each other, organic unity. A strong military power of a powerful country is not only to create national ""security products"", but also to play its role in supporting the overall strength and competitiveness of the country's strategy, greatly enhancing the country's political, economic, cultural and diplomatic power, so that in many aspects of the country to obtain more strategic initiative and greater interests. This is a huge comprehensive spillover effect of strong military power. In short, many political victories can be realized and guaranteed by a strong military. On the new journey, if we want to build a modernized socialist country, we must have a world-class army as a strong strategic support. Adhere to the dialectical unity of integrity and innovation. ""Adherence to political leadership"" embodies the will of the Party and the people, manifests itself as a major political judgment and decision-making, points out the direction and path for practice in various fields, and draws a bottom line that cannot be crossed and a red line that cannot be breached. We must insist on keeping the right, so as not to lose our way and not to make subversive mistakes. At the same time, we must see that, without innovation, keeping the right will lose its vitality. To unify the firmness and flexibility, the decision and deployment made by the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi must be implemented unconditionally to ensure that there is no bias, no variation, no deviation, and at the same time, practical innovations must be made to ensure that the strategic intent of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi is truly implemented, so that the ""political leadership"" is transformed into a new era of the cause of strengthening the military. This will enable the ""political leadership"" to be transformed into a fruitful and favorable situation for the cause of strengthening the military in the new era. Fully implement the principle of ""adhere to the political leadership"" Since the 18th CPC National Congress, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi, the People's Army has been refining the purity of its loyalty, replenishing the calcium of its spirit, purging the shortcomings of its style of work, eliminating the louse in the army, and fixing the foundation for winning the war. ...... Ideological reorganization and spiritual baptism have led the people's army to reorganize and set off again. On the new journey, we have to fully implement the principle of ""adhere to the political leadership"" requirements, to promote the cause of the strong army to a new stage, to achieve new leaps. We must adhere to the Party's absolute leadership of the army. We must comprehensively strengthen the Party's construction of the People's Army, and ensure that the barrel of the gun always listens to the Party's command. On the new journey, the people's army must hold on to the lifeblood of the Party's command of the gun, deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", firmly establish the ""four confidence"", and achieve the ""four confidence"". The two establishments have been established to enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", strengthen the ""four self-confidence"", achieve the ""two safeguards"", carry out the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission, continuously improve political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, and always maintain a high degree of consistency with the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and President Xi in ideology, politics, and action, so as to be firmly obedient to the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and President Xi at all times and in all circumstances. The CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi command. We must serve the people wholeheartedly. We must always stand firm on the people's position, practice the fundamental tenet of serving the people wholeheartedly, and always be the people's sons and daughters. Always stand with the people, continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of serving the people, uphold the value of love for the people, pass on the red genes of the people's army, and maintain the relationship with the people that is one of water and milk, life and death. Keeping in mind the sacred duty of carrying the gun for the people and fighting for the people, excelling in martial arts, practicing with dedication, comprehensively improving the level of training and preparation for war and the ability to win in the new era, and resolutely defending the people's peaceful labor and life with hard-core competence, we will always be a heroic army that the Party and the people can fully rely on. Actively participate in and support local economic and social construction, courageously undertake urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, take practical action to benefit the people, consolidate and develop the military-government-military solidarity, so that the roots of the people's army are deeply planted in the fertile soil of the people. It is necessary to always think about and deal with military issues from a political height. We must take the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as the highest interest of the state and the nation, put the national defense and military construction in the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as a major goal to understand and promote the military struggle as an important aspect of the great struggle to carry out the planning, to avoid strategic blunders. We should always plan and guide the war around political purposes, grasp the influence of political factors on the war, choose the timing of the war with an eye on the political situation, prejudge the political situation, assess the risk of war, and consider the overall benefits of any military action, and implement military action according to political needs. We must faithfully fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the Party and the people. We must grasp the strategic national security needs of the new era and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests with stronger capabilities and more reliable means. Stand firmly under the Party's banner, resolutely safeguard the security of state power and system, and resolutely maintain political and social stability; be ready to fight hard battles at any time, carry out military struggles firmly and flexibly, effectively carry out external military provocations, and resolutely defend the core interests of the country; continuously enhance the ability to attempt diversified military missions in a wider space; adapt to the strategic requirement of serving the building of a community of shared destiny for mankind, and actively fulfill the We will adapt to the strategic requirements of serving the building of a community of human destiny, actively fulfill our responsibilities and obligations commensurate with our international status, and play a greater role in maintaining a peaceful international and neighboring environment.

共产党人应有的根本政治担当 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：周燕虎 责任编辑：张硕 2023-05-18 08:01:16 0,共产党人应有的根本政治担当 ■周燕虎 ●把对党忠诚体现在为党分忧、为党尽职的实际行动上，把为民造福作为崇高事业追求 认真学习《习近平著作选读》第一卷、第二卷，习主席在党的十九大报告《决胜全面建成小康社会，夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利》中，谆谆告诫全党同志：“要加强党性锻炼，不断提高政治觉悟和政治能力，把对党忠诚、为党分忧、为党尽职、为民造福作为根本政治担当，永葆共产党人政治本色。”政治过硬要求政治担当，政治担当彰显政治本色。新时代新征程上，广大党员干部要真正做到让党信得过、靠得住、能放心，必须淬炼铁一般的政治担当，以夙夜在公的责任感、积极担当作为的精气神，为党和人民履好职、尽好责，把党的事业不断推向前进。 人无担当不立，党无担当不兴。大到一个政党，小到党员个体，如果缺乏应有的政治担当，很难行稳致远、有所作为，更无法治国济世、造福人民。中国共产党具有强烈的政治担当，从诞生的那一天起，我们党就把为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴系于自身，以高度自觉的历史主动精神，担当起让这个饱经沧桑的古老民族重新焕发青春活力、重新屹立于世界民族之林的历史使命。也正因为始终把这份使命责任深植灵魂血脉、高高举过头顶，我们党才能越是艰险越向前、敢教日月换新天，磨练形成了成功开辟中国道路的政治智慧、直面矛盾问题的政治勇气以及不断为人民群众创造美好生活的政治自觉。可以说，政治担当是共产党人无坚不摧、无往不胜的鲜明标识和强大力量。对广大党员干部来说，始终具备共产党人应有的政治担当，把对党忠诚体现在为党分忧、为党尽职的实际行动上，把为民造福作为崇高事业追求，积极履职尽责、奋力担当作为，才能走好新的赶考之路。 “天下至德，莫大乎忠。”对党忠诚，是共产党人首要的政治品质。习主席强调：“对党忠诚，必须一心一意、一以贯之，必须表里如一、知行合一，任何时候任何情况下都不改其心、不移其志、不毁其节。”我们党一路走来，经历了无数艰险和磨难，但任何困难都没有压垮我们，任何敌人都没能打倒我们，靠的就是千千万万党员的忠诚。夏明翰就义前从容写下“砍头不要紧，只要主义真”；杨匏安面对反动派的威逼利诱，斩钉截铁地回答“死可以，变节不行”……对党忠诚，早已融入中国共产党人的血液，体现到无论付出多少牺牲和代价都毫不动摇的实际行动中。对党忠诚，不是抽象的而是具体的，不是有条件的而是无条件的，必须体现到信仰的忠诚上，体现到真心爱党、时刻忧党、坚定护党、全力兴党上，体现到坚决贯彻党的主张、为党尽职尽责工作上。党员干部必须一心听党话，铁心跟党走，以担苦、担难、担重、担险的实际行动诠释对党的无限忠诚，“虽九死其犹未悔”，甘愿为党的事业贡献全部智慧和力量。 “江山就是人民，人民就是江山。”为民造福，是中国共产党立党为公、执政为民的本质要求。一路走来，党的一切工作都是为老百姓利益着想，让老百姓幸福就是党的事业。无数优秀共产党人更是把为民造福作为最大政绩和毕生追求。焦裕禄在兰考几乎把所有时间都用在带领干部群众斗风沙、战旱涝、兴水利、为民谋福祉上；孔繁森在雪域高原跋涉数万公里摸索发展之策；杨善洲用20多年造就莽莽林海惠及当地人民群众……正是因为一批又一批优秀党员干部朝朝暮暮心系民生、时时事事行动为民，我们党才能拥有最为深厚的执政底气和最为坚实的执政根基。习主席指出：“中国共产党执政，就是要把中国特色社会主义事业一步步向前推进，全心全力把老百姓的事一件一件办好，让老百姓过上更加美好的生活。”广大党员干部要始终把人民立场作为根本立场，把造福人民作为崇高使命，牢固树立正确的权力观、政绩观、事业观，为民甘洒血和汗，俯首甘为孺子牛，真诚倾听群众呼声、真实反映群众愿望、真情关心群众疾苦，不断解决好人民群众最关心最直接最现实的利益问题，以为民谋利、为民尽责、为民解忧、为民造福的实际行动温暖人心、取信于民。 “绳短不能汲深井，浅水难以负大舟。”对党忠诚、为党分忧、为党尽责、为民造福，不仅需要政治过硬，也需要能力过硬；不仅需要担当的宽肩膀，还需要成事的真本领。软肩膀挑不起硬担子，只有本领过硬，多“几把刷子”，政治担当才能底气十足，攻坚克难才能充满自信，干事创业才能硕果满枝。口号喊得震天响，本领不过硬，本职工作干不好、任务重担挑不起、矛盾困难解不开、推动发展无实招，不仅难以有所作为，还会迟滞事业发展。然而，过硬本领不会从天而降、自动生成，也没有任何捷径可走，更不会随着年龄增长而自然提高。只有历得风雨侵，才有梅花傲枝头。广大党员干部要想“曾益其所不能”，不断提高肩膀的承重力，就要弘扬苦干实干精神，坚持事不避难、义不逃责，立足本职岗位埋头苦干、艰苦奋斗，在机遇面前主动出击，不犹豫、不观望，在困难面前迎难而上，不推诿、不逃避，在风险面前积极应对，不畏缩、不躲闪。敢啃硬骨头、敢于涉险滩，不仅能够练就一颗永不言败的“大心脏”，更能铸就一副能挑千钧重担的“铁肩膀”，真正成为堪当时代重任的中坚力量，推动事业航船扬帆远航。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230519000314/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225015.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230518042539/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225015.html,2023-05-19 0:00:00,The fundamental political bearing that communists should have Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zhou Yanhu Editor-in-Chief: Zhang Shuo 2023-05-18 08:01:16 0,"The fundamental political bearing that communists should have ■ Zhou Yanhu ● embodied the loyalty to the Party in the practical action of sharing the Party's worries and doing their duty for the Party, and the pursuit of the people's welfare as a noble cause Study carefully the first and second volumes of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, President Xi, in the report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC (Nineteenth CPC Congress), ""Successfully building a well-off society in all aspects, and winning a great victory in socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,"" earnestly warned the whole Party: ""We must strengthen our party spirit, constantly improve our political awareness and political ability, take loyalty to the Party, share the Party's worries, do our duty for the Party, and bring benefits to the people as our fundamental political bearing, and always maintain the political character of communists."" Political toughness requires political commitment, political commitment highlights the political nature. A new era and a new journey, the majority of party members and cadres to really make the party trusted, reliable, can rest assured, must refine the iron general political bearing, with a sense of responsibility at all times, and actively take on the role as a spirit, for the party and the people to fulfill their duties, do their duty, the party's cause to move forward. People can't stand without bearing, the party can't prosper without bearing. As large as a political party, as small as an individual party member, if the lack of due political commitment, it is difficult to move steadily and make a difference, and even more unable to rule the country and benefit the world and the people. The Communist Party of China has a strong political commitment, from the day of its birth, the Party will seek happiness for the Chinese people, the Chinese nation's rejuvenation of its own, with a high degree of self-consciousness of the spirit of historical initiative, to take up the ancient people who have been through the vicissitudes of life and rejuvenation of youthful vigor, and to re-establish itself in the world's peoples of the historic mission. It is also because always this mission responsibility is deeply rooted in the soul blood, high above the head, our party can be the more difficult and dangerous the more forward, dare to teach the sun and the moon for a new day, honed the formation of the success of China's path of political wisdom, the political courage to face the contradictions and problems and continue to create a better life for the masses of the people of the political self-awareness. It can be said that political commitment is the distinctive mark and powerful force that makes communists indestructible and invincible. For the majority of party members and cadres, always have the political bearing that communists should have, embodied in the party's loyalty to the party to share the party's worries, for the party's duty on the actual action, the people's welfare as a noble cause to pursue, and actively fulfill their duties, and strive to play as, in order to walk the road of the new examination. ""The world's greatest virtue is nothing more than loyalty."" Loyalty to the Party is the primary political quality of a communist. President Xi emphasized: ""Loyalty to the Party, must be single-minded, consistent, must be the same as the table, know and act in unity, at any time and under any circumstances do not change their hearts, do not change their will, do not destroy their section."" Our party has gone through countless hardships and tribulations along the way, but no difficulty has overwhelmed us, and no enemy has been able to defeat us, relying on the loyalty of millions of party members. Xia Minghan wrote ""It doesn't matter if you cut off your head, as long as your doctrine is true"" before his martyrdom; Yang Lagenarian, faced with the coercion and temptation of the reactionaries, answered ""death is fine, but not defection"" with a firm resolve. ...... Loyalty to the Party has long been incorporated into the blood of Chinese communists, and is reflected in their practical actions which are unwavering no matter how many sacrifices and costs they have to pay. Loyalty to the Party, not abstract but concrete, not conditional but unconditional, must be embodied in the faith of loyalty, embodied in the sincere love of the Party, always worried about the Party, firm protection of the Party, the Party, the Party, embodied in the resolute implementation of the Party's proposition for the Party to work dutifully and conscientiously. Party members and cadres must listen to the Party with one heart, follow the Party with an iron heart, to bear the pain, bear the difficulty, bear the weight, bear the risk of practical action to interpret the infinite loyalty to the Party, ""although nine deaths of its still not regret"", willing to contribute to the cause of the Party's full wisdom and strength. ""The mountains are the people, and the people are the mountains."" For the benefit of the people is the essential requirement for the CPC to stand up for the public and rule for the people. Along the way, all the Party's work is for the benefit of the people, so that the people's happiness is the Party's cause. Countless outstanding communists have made the welfare of the people their greatest achievement and lifelong pursuit. Jiao Yulu in Lankao almost all the time spent in leading cadres and masses to fight sand, droughts and floods, water conservancy, for the well-being of the people; Kong Fan Sen in the snowy plateau trekking tens of thousands of kilometers to find the development of the policy; Yang Shanzhou with more than 20 years of mangled forests to benefit the local people ...... It is precisely because of a batch and batch of excellent party cadres towards the end of the day! It is because a number of outstanding Party cadres are always concerned about people's livelihoods and act for the people at all times that our Party has the most profound governing atmosphere and the most solid governing foundation. President Xi pointed out that ""the CPC is in power to advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics step by step, and to do the people's business one by one with all its heart and all its strength, so that the people can lead a better life."" The majority of Party members and cadres should always take the people's position as the fundamental position, to benefit the people as a noble mission, firmly establish a correct view of power, performance, career, for the people willing to spill blood and sweat, bend their heads willingly for the children's cows, sincerely listen to the voices of the masses, the real reflection of the aspirations of the masses, true concern for the plight of the masses, and constantly solve the most concerned about the most direct and most realistic interests of the masses in order to work for the benefit of the people, do their duty for the people, The actual action of seeking benefits for the people, doing one's duty for the people, and solving problems for the people and creating benefits for the people warms the hearts of the people and wins their trust. ""A short rope cannot draw a deep well, and shallow water is difficult to carry a large boat."" Loyalty to the party, for the party to worry, for the party to do their duty, for the people's welfare, not only need to be politically tough, but also need to be able to be tough; not only need to play the broad shoulders, but also need to be able to do the real skills. Soft shoulders can not pick a hard burden, only hard skills, more ""a few brushes"", political commitment to be full of confidence, to overcome difficulties to be full of confidence, entrepreneurship to be fruitful. Slogans shouted loud and clear, the skills are not good, the work is not good, the task of heavy burden can not afford, conflicts and difficulties can not be solved, to promote the development of no real move, not only difficult to make a difference, but also stagnate the development of the cause. However, hard skills will not fall from the sky, automatically generated, there is no shortcut to go, and will not naturally improve with age. Only through the wind and rain invasion, only the plum blossom proud branches. Party members and cadres want to ""have benefited from its can not"", and constantly improve the shoulder force, we must carry forward the spirit of hard work, adhere to the matter does not take refuge, righteousness does not run away from responsibility, based on their own positions and work hard, hard work, hard work, take the initiative in front of the opportunity, do not hesitate, do not wait and see, in front of the difficulties, do not blame, do not escape, in front of the risks! In front of the risk to respond positively, do not cower, do not dodge. Dare to gnaw hard bones, dare to wade through dangerous shoals, not only can develop a never-say-die ""big heart"", more can cast a pair of can pick a thousand pounds of heavy burden of ""iron shoulders"", really become the backbone of the heavy responsibility of the times, and to promote the cause of the ship sailing away.","The article highlights the importance of political bearing that communists should have. Loyalty to the Party, sharing the Party's worries, doing their duty for the Party, and bringing benefits to the people are considered the fundamental political bearing. The article emphasizes that political toughness requires political commitment and highlights the political nature of political commitment. Throughout history, the Communist Party of China has demonstrated its loyalty and its mission to improve the lives of the Chinese people. The article also calls for party members and cadres to have the political bearing that communists should have and to fulfill their duties and responsibilities for the benefit of the people."

Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is contemporary Chinese Marxism, twenty-first century Marxism, the essence of the times of Chinese culture and the Chinese spirit, and the guiding ideology that the Party and the country must adhere to for a long time. We must deeply comprehend the great significance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully recognize its original, historic and worldwide contributions, and consciously use it to arm our minds, guide our practice and promote our work. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a practically tested and practically powerful ideological weapon, and has demonstrated a powerful force of truth in promoting the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. It is the fundamental guideline for the development of the Party and the country in the new era. A mature Marxist party must have a strong leadership core and must be correctly guided by scientific ideas. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, founded in the great practice of the new era and constantly enriched and developed with the great changes of the new era, is the fundamental guideline for the development of the Party and the country's undertakings in the new era. The Party's establishment of Comrade Xi Jinping's position as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, and the guiding position of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, reflecting the common aspiration of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole nation of all ethnic groups, are of decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country's undertakings in the new era, and for the advancement of the historic process of the great revival of the Chinese nation. Practice has fully proved that the ""two establishments"" is a major political achievement of the Party in the new era, which is the greatest certainty, the greatest confidence and the greatest guarantee to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and cope with all uncertainties on the way forward. The decisive factor for the great achievements of the new era. Since entering the new era, we have fully implemented Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, comprehensively carried out the Party's basic line and basic strategies, taken a series of strategic initiatives, pushed forward a series of transformative practices, realized a series of breakthroughs, and achieved a series of landmark results, overcoming many long-standing unresolved problems and accomplishing many major and important things of long-term significance, and withstood the challenges that have come from the political, economy, ideology, nature and other risks and challenges, the Party and the country's cause has made historic achievements and changes, and has pushed our country to embark on a new journey to build a modern socialist country in all aspects.

A guide to action for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Since entering the new era, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has made a scientific and complete strategic plan for the development of the Party and the country's undertakings in the new era, taking into account the overall situation of the strategy for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great changes that have not been seen in the world for a century. From clarifying the overall tasks of realizing socialist modernization and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, putting forward the ""five-in-one"" overall layout, the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout and the ""four great"" historical missions, to the CPC's 20th anniversary, the CPC Central Committee has made a complete and scientific strategic plan for the development of the Party and the country in the new era.

""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has always been a fundamental guideline for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics at the new historical starting point, and an action guide for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. II Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has made an original contribution to the enrichment and development of Marxism by insisting on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture. Answer the issues of the times and realize a new leap in the modernization of Marxism. Great theories emerge from great times, and great theories lead great times. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a scientific theory that is based on the foundation of the era, answers the questions of the era, and leads the changes of the era. This thought has systematically answered such major issues of the times as what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics should be adhered to and developed in the new era, how to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, what kind of modernized socialist powerhouse should be built and how to build it, what kind of long-ruling Marxist political party should be built, and how to build a long-ruling Marxist political party, etc., and has put forward a series of original new ideas and strategies for governing the country, realizing a new leap in the modernization of Marxism. Deepen the understanding of laws and open up new horizons for the modernization of Marxism. Theories can be persuasive as long as they are thorough, and the thoroughness of a theory means grasping the fundamentals of things and revealing their laws. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era comprehensively grasps the ""two big picture"", adheres to and applies the basic principles of Marxism, and makes many major principle innovations in Marxist philosophy, political economy and scientific socialism. This ideology connects history, reality and the future, covering all areas of China's reform, development and stability, internal affairs, foreign affairs, diplomacy and national defense, and the governance of the Party, the country and the military, and has deepened the understanding of the laws of Communist Party governance, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society with a brand new vision, opening up a new realm of the modernization of the Chinese version of Marxism. Adhere to the ""two combinations"" and promote theoretical innovation on the basis of practice. There is no end to practice and no end to theoretical innovation. The CPC deeply recognizes that only by insisting on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture can it always maintain the vitality and vigor of Marxism. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a shining example of the ""combination of the two"", and it is precisely in the process of the ""combination of the two"" that Marxism has continued to manifest its national character and has increasingly demonstrated its powerful vitality; it is also precisely in the process of the ""combination of the two"" that Marxism has been able to maintain its vitality and vigor. It is also in the process of ""combining the two"" that the vitality and vigor of the excellent traditional Chinese culture have been fully stimulated. III Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture, has made a historic contribution to the inheritance and development of Chinese outstanding traditional culture.

In the article ""The Party Must Courageously Engage in Self-Revolution"" in Volume 1 of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, President Xi profoundly pointed out, ""To revitalize and strengthen the Party, we must realistically understand and grasp ourselves. ensure that the Party remains vital, it must know and grasp itself realistically, and build and refine itself in the spirit of courageous self-revolution."" This important statement by President Xi clarifies the extreme importance of self-revolution for the party to maintain its advancement and purity and become a Marxist ruling party that cannot be defeated or crushed, reflecting the sense of anxiety of a century-old party in times of peace and the political self-awareness of the party to develop and strengthen the party. The courage to self-revolution is the distinguishing mark of our party from other political parties, and it is the secret of its success that it has jumped out of the historical periodicity of rule and chaos and has become more energetic through the vicissitudes of the past hundred years. As the world's largest party, there is no external force that can defeat us, and the only one that can defeat us is ourselves. In the face of the historical mission of building a strong modern socialist country and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization, in the face of the major challenges of high winds and waves and even terrifying waves on the road ahead, and in the face of the long-standing ""four major tests"" and ""four dangers"", President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the ""four major tests"" and ""four dangers"". ""President Xi has repeatedly emphasized self-revolution, pointing out that ""the more onerous the task, the greater the risks and tests, the more important to carry forward the spirit of self-revolution"" ""the Party's self-revolution is a heavy task and a long way to go. Party members and cadres must deeply understand the significance of self-revolution for the success or failure of the party's cause, and always maintain the sobriety of catching up with the test, and the spirit of self-revolution to build and refine their own, so that the party will always remain advanced and pure, and will always remain vitality and vigor. Courageous self-revolution, must replenish calcium and strong bones, detoxification and sterilization. President Xi pointed out that self-revolution is to replenish calcium, detoxify and sterilize the bones, break the wrists, remove the rotting muscles, constantly remove the virus that erodes the healthy body of the party, constantly improve its immunity, and prevent the death of the government. In the long-term ruling conditions, all kinds of factors that weaken the party's advancement and damage the party's purity are everywhere, and all kinds of dangers that violate the original mission and shake the foundation of the party are everywhere. History and practice have proved that Marxist faith, the lofty ideals of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics are the spiritual pillars and political souls of the CPC, and that only with firm faith and beliefs can we remove impurities, get rid of viruses, and prevent pollution, and truly realize self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, and self-improvement. The majority of party members and cadres is to firmly grasp the ideals and beliefs as an eternal subject, regardless of the waves or thorns in the road, are able to maintain the ""chaotic clouds still calm"" political strength, not for all kinds of temptation; to maintain the ""10,000 bells in my why add to it"" noble quality, not for all kinds of gains and losses. Quality, not to be disturbed by all kinds of gains and losses; to maintain the ""long wind and waves will sometimes"" high morale, not to be blocked by all kinds of difficulties, so that the torch of ideals and beliefs in the heart of the burning, selfless, fearless, and charge in the party and the people where they need it most. Courageous self-revolution, we must adhere to the truth and correct errors. President Xi pointed out that our Party always promotes social revolution while courageously promoting self-revolution, always adheres to the truth and corrects errors, and dares to face up to problems and overcome shortcomings. Looking back at a hundred years of party history, the greatness of the CPC lies not in not making mistakes, but in never avoiding illnesses, daring to face up to problems, courageous in self-revolution, and possessing an extremely strong self-repairing ability. People are not sages, who can not make mistakes. Party members and cadres, the error is not terrible, the error can not choose to escape, but to know over that change, always keep as thin ice, know the stop there is a sober vigilance, in order to face the problem, the determination to change the courage, in the examination of the problem, correcting errors and change in the growth of the pluck. To adhere to the principle must always adhere to, the gate must be firmly guarded firmly, never right and wrong, unclear position, never look forward and backward, fearful, never knowingly, swaying; but also to ""do not have to, ask for their own"" attitude to examine their own, do not avoid the problem, do not shirk their responsibilities, do not write off the wrongs, have the courage to face up to the problem, have the courage to face up to the problem, have the courage to correct the wrongs. Problems are brave to face up to, there are mistakes to shoulder the responsibility, there are mistakes to admit and actively correct. Courageous self-revolutionary, must knife edge to the inside, scraping the bones. President Xi pointed out that how to be considered tough is to dare to carry out self-revolution, dare to turn the blade inward, dare to scrape the bones and heal the wounds. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has pushed forward with a thunderous force the overall strict governance of the Party, opened the knife to the intractable miasma within the Party, and took drastic medicines to get rid of the disease, and cured the chaos with heavy grace, so that the Party has become stronger and more powerful in the revolutionary forging. To continue to promote the new era of the Party's construction of a new great project, we must always adhere to the main tone of strict and unshakeable, put discipline and rules in the forefront, catch the early and small, to prevent the slightest gradual; carry forward the spirit of nails, persevere in the implementation of the spirit of the Central Committee of the spirit of the eight provisions, the spirit of the Military Commission of the spirit of the ten provisions and their implementation rules, resolutely correct and cure formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance, and resolutely resist privileged thinking, privileged behavior; Punish corruption with zero tolerance, dare to fight, good at fighting, adhere to not dare to rot, can not rot, do not want to rot as one to promote, punishment and deterrence, institutional constraints, and improve awareness as one. Party members and cadres should diligently dust ""thought dust"", think more ""greed harm"", often break the ""thief in the heart"", no delusional thoughts to ensure that there is no delusional action outside, and effectively guard the doer, handle, use power, and interact with the bottom line. The bottom line is to take every step in life. President Xi emphasized that the overall strict governance of the party is always on the road, the party's self-revolution is always on the road, there must be no relaxation, fatigue and boredom. The one who walks a hundred miles is half ninety. If you are hot before and cold after, tight before and loose after, you will lose all your efforts. At present, the Chinese nation is closer to, more confident and capable of realizing the goal of great rejuvenation than at any other time in history, but the closer we get to success, the bigger the storm, the more we need to unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution, maintain strategic stability, and keep a clear head. Party members and cadres to implement this requirement, we must always bear in mind that ""iron still needs its own hard"" reasoning, adhere to the strict word at the head, a strict in the end, to promote the overall strict governance of the party to continue to lead to deeper and deeper; always lead from the top, the first level of demonstration to the first level to see, the first level of the first level of work, lead and drive the majority of officers and soldiers to practice good war, thick war can; Always with the ""success does not have to be in my"" frame of mind, a blueprint drawn to the end, a hammer after a hammer, with a stone to leave a mark, grasp the iron with traces of style to grasp the preparation for war and the implementation of all the work; always bear in mind the mission of the original heart, to maintain sobriety and firmness in solving the big party's unique problems, to keep up with the pace of the times, to forge a strong fortress to overcome the challenges of the new era and new challenges of the new era. We will take on the role of a new era and a new journey to win a new and greater victory.","The article highlights the importance of self-revolution for the Party to maintain its advancement and purity. It emphasizes the need to continually review and improve oneself, be truthful and correct errors, and have the courage to face problems and acknowledge mistakes. The Party must also adhere to strict governance, prevent corruption, and maintain stability in order to achieve its goals.

认真领悟“六个必须坚持”蕴含的深刻哲理 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：姜厚平 责任编辑：张硕 2023-05-19 07:02:40 1,认真领悟“六个必须坚持”蕴含的深刻哲理 ■姜厚平 习主席在学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育工作会议上强调，“要全面学习领会新时代中国特色社会主义思想，全面系统掌握这一思想的基本观点、科学体系，把握好这一思想的世界观、方法论，坚持好、运用好贯穿其中的立场观点方法”。 党的二十大报告提出的“六个必须坚持”，即必须坚持人民至上、必须坚持自信自立、必须坚持守正创新、必须坚持问题导向、必须坚持系统观念、必须坚持胸怀天下，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的立场观点方法的重要体现，是这一思想的精髓和灵魂，是对马克思主义哲学的创新性发展。我们必须认真领悟“六个必须坚持”中蕴含的深刻哲理，做到知其言更知其义、知其然更知其所以然，使之成为认识世界和改造世界的思想武器。 一 学好用好马克思主义哲学，一直是我们党的优良传统，也是我们党的思想优势和政治优势。马克思主义哲学是我们党全部理论和实践的思想基础。毛泽东同志曾经说过，马克思主义有几门学问，但基础的东西是马克思主义哲学。“六个必须坚持”牢牢植根于马克思主义哲学，并对其进行继承和发展。 习主席指出：“马克思主义博大精深，归根到底就是一句话，为人类求解放。”坚持人民至上和坚持胸怀天下是把人民幸福与人类进步紧密连接起来，使我们党既站在马克思主义真理的制高点，又站在人类道义的制高点，为我们党统筹国内国际两个大局提供了科学的世界观和方法论，坚持和发展了马克思主义哲学“人民至上”和“为人类求解放”的基本立场。坚持自信自立是对马克思主义国家观的创造性运用，是对我们党独立自主治国理政方略的创新性发展，对以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴具有重大的理论和实践意义。坚持守正创新彰显了新时代中国共产党人对马克思主义哲学方法论的创新和发展，体现了变与不变、继承与发展、原则性与创造性的辩证统一。坚持问题导向是马克思主义的鲜明特点，旨在解决新时代改革开放和社会主义现代化建设中的实际问题。坚持系统观念蕴含着马克思主义哲学事物普遍联系的观点，重在强调优化整体与部分、要素与结构的关系，努力实现整体效益最大化，是对马克思主义哲学思维方法和工作方法的丰富和发展。 二 任何真正的哲学都是自己时代精神的精华。实践证明，一种思想理论不断走向体系化、成熟化的重要标志，体现为哲学方法论的科学凝练。 “六个必须坚持”深深植根于中华优秀传统文化的沃土，汲取了中国传统哲学所蕴含的智慧和精华，同人民群众日用而不觉的共同价值观念相融相通，体现着中国共产党民为邦本、天下为公的价值追求，世界大同、天下一家的视野胸襟，同中国人民在长期生产生活中积累的宇宙观、天下观、社会观、道德观相契合，是坚持历史自信、文化自信，古为今用、推陈出新的哲学典范。 “六个必须坚持”丰富和发展了马克思主义世界观和方法论。“六个必须坚持”是中国共产党人在推进马克思主义中国化时代化的历史进程中淬炼形成的智慧结晶，浓缩着我们党追求真理、揭示真理、笃行真理的思想探索史、理论创新史。一路走来，我们党始终准确把握科学理论创新的规律性，始终坚持“中国的问题必须从中国基本国情出发，由中国人自己来解答”，先后创立了毛泽东思想、邓小平理论，形成了“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观，创立了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，为党和人民事业发展提供了既一脉相承又与时俱进的科学理论指导，不断开辟马克思主义中国化时代化新境界。 “六个必须坚持”启发了世界人民探索现代化道路的哲学思考。“照抄照搬别国经验、别国模式，从来不能得到成功。”新时代中国理论、中国道路、中国制度的成功实践充分表明，“六个必须坚持”是科学的世界观和方法论，它提供的并不是一种现成的模式，而是一种各国可以借鉴的方法，为世界上那些既希望加快发展又希望保持自身独立的国家和民族，走符合本国国情的道路提供了全新选择，为人类文明进步、世界和平发展贡献了中国智慧、中国方案。 三 “六个必须坚持”是环环相扣、内在统一的有机整体，贯通构建起我们认识世界和改造世界的思想理论体系。唯有准确把握“六个必须坚持”，才能学深悟透习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。 坚持马克思主义，最重要的是坚持马克思主义基本原理和贯穿其中的立场观点方法。早在延安时期，毛泽东同志在《改造我们的学习》中就提出，许多同志“只会片面地引用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的个别词句，而不会运用他们的立场、观点和方法，来具体地研究中国的现状和中国的历史，具体地分析中国革命问题和解决中国革命问题”。“六个必须坚持”遵循从“立场”到“观点”再到“方法”的逻辑链路，构成了相互联系、互为支撑的思想体系。只有准确把握“六个必须坚持”的内涵要义和理论逻辑，才能把思想方法搞对头，认识问题才能站得高，分析问题才能看得深，开展工作也才能把得准。 马克思主义哲学是理论价值与实践价值的统一。一直以来，我们党既为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴，也为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同。“六个必须坚持”以自信自立、守正创新的理论态度，以问题导向、系统观念的实践路径，为实现新时代新征程党的使命任务解决了“桥和船”的问题。党的十八大以来，精准扶贫、疫情防控等关系国计民生的一系列重大部署，弘扬全人类共同价值、构建人类命运共同体等关系全球治理的一系列中国方案，正是“六个必须坚持”的生动注脚。 “六个必须坚持”是我们党在极不寻常、极不平凡历史进程中，在科学标定我国发展的历史方位、主要矛盾、战略规划的基础上，准确识变、科学应变、主动求变而形成的系统方法论。其中蕴含着站稳立场、保持定力的原则性方法，把握大势、谋深虑远的战略性方法，统筹兼顾、重点突破的策略性方法等。我们必须进一步学习掌握“六个必须坚持”，为前瞻性思考、全局性谋划、整体性推进各项事业和工作提供科学思想方法指导。 四 “六个必须坚持”彰显了“知行合一”的哲学品格，为我们破解时代课题、把握历史主动、创造光明未来提供了科学的世界观和方法论。 前进道路上，无论局势如何变化、挑战如何严峻，我们都要坚信真理的力量，以自信自立的态度、守正创新的精神、胸怀天下的格局，牢牢把握住政治性方向性原则性问题，深刻认识自身发展和外部环境的互动变化，树立正确看待世界格局及其演变的历史观、大局观、角色观，坚定不移站在历史正确的一边，站在人类进步的一边，在乱花迷眼、乱云飞渡中清醒把握时与势、辩证研判危与机。 马克思主义本质上是一种批判的、革命的理论。学习掌握“六个必须坚持”，就要领悟其中蕴含的正视问题、较真碰硬、迎难而上等精神品格，时时刻刻刀刃向内审示自我，坚持严的基调，保持高压态势，深化标本兼治，持之以恒推进全面从严治党，深入推进新时代党的建设新的伟大工程，不断清除侵蚀党的健康肌体的病毒，以解决大党独有难题的清醒和坚定，确保党永远不变质、不变色、不变味。 当前，国际形势复杂多变，敢于斗争、善于斗争，我们就一定能够战胜前进道路的一切困难挑战。用好“六个必须坚持”的方法论，就要以普遍联系的、全面系统的、发展变化的观点观察认识强敌对手，把握好军事与政治、战争与和平、稳局与塑势、威慑与实战、人与武器等重大关系，对可能发生的战争风险始终保持战略清醒、底线思维，因势而谋、应势而动、顺势而为，有力慑止战争，坚决打赢战争。 时下，强军事业正处于爬坡过坎的关键期，我们要始终沿着习主席指引的方向勇毅前行，秉持“六个必须坚持”所蕴含的世界观和方法论，运用系统观念、坚持问题导向、打开视野格局，拿出真正解决问题的新理念新思路新办法，补短板、强弱项，为推进新时代强军事业提供科学世界观和方法论指导。 （作者单位：西部战区空军）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230522000851/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225361.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230522182610/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225361.html,2023-05-22 0:00:00,"Seriously understand the profound philosophy contained in the ""six must adhere to"" Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Jiang Houping Editor-in-Chief: Zhang Shuo 2023-05-19 07:02:40 1","The profound philosophy contained in the ""six must be adhered to"" ■ Jiang Houping President Xi emphasized at the conference on the theme of education for the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era that ""we must comprehensively study and understand the thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and comprehensively and systematically grasp the basic viewpoints and scientific system of this thought. We must comprehensively study and comprehend the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, comprehensively and systematically grasp the basic viewpoints and scientific system of this thought, grasp the worldview and methodology of this thought, and adhere to and utilize the position and viewpoint methodology that runs through it."" The ""six musts"" put forward in the report of the 20th CPC National Congress, namely, that the people must be paramount, self-confidence and self-reliance must be upheld, righteousness and innovation must be upheld, problem orientation must be upheld, a systematic conception must be upheld, and the world must be upheld, are an important embodiment of the position and viewpoints and methods of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and the essence and soul of this thought. It is the essence and soul of this thought, and an innovative development of Marxist philosophy. We must seriously understand the profound philosophy contained in the ""six must adhere to"", so as to know the meaning of the words and the reasons for them, and to make them a weapon of thought for understanding and transforming the world. Learning and utilizing Marxist philosophy has always been the fine tradition of our Party, and it is also our Party's ideological and political advantage. Marxist philosophy is the ideological foundation of all our Party's theory and practice. Comrade Mao Zedong once said that there are several disciplines of Marxism, but the basic thing is Marxist philosophy. The ""six must be adhered to"" are firmly rooted in Marxist philosophy, and are inherited and developed. President Xi pointed out, ""Marxism is profound and profound, and in the final analysis, it is just one sentence, seeking liberation for mankind."" Insisting on the supremacy of the people and the world is a way of closely linking the happiness of the people with the progress of mankind, enabling our Party to stand on the heights of both Marxist truth and human morality, providing a scientific worldview and methodology for the Party to coordinate the two major domestic and international situations, and adhering to and developing the ""supremacy of the people"" and ""emancipation for the sake of mankind"" of the philosophy of Marxism. It adheres to and develops the basic stance of Marxist philosophy of ""the supremacy of the people"" and ""seeking liberation for mankind"". Insisting on self-confidence and self-reliance is a creative application of the Marxist concept of the state, an innovative development of our Party's independent governance strategy, and of great theoretical and practical significance to the comprehensive advancement of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by means of Chinese-style modernization. Adhering to the principle of abiding by the truth and innovation highlights the innovation and development of Marxist philosophical methodology by the CPC in the new era, reflecting the dialectical unity of change and invariance, inheritance and development, and principle and creativity. Adherence to problem orientation is a distinctive feature of Marxism, aiming at solving practical problems in the reform and opening-up and socialist modernization of the new era. Adherence to the system concept implies the viewpoint of the universal connection of things in Marxist philosophy, which emphasizes the optimization of the relationship between the whole and its parts, elements and structure, and strives to maximize the overall efficiency, and is the enrichment and development of Marxist philosophy's thinking and working methods. II Any true philosophy is the essence of the spirit of its own time. Practice has proved that the important sign of an ideology and theory constantly moving towards systematization and maturity is reflected in the scientific condensation of philosophical methodology. The ""six must be insisted upon"" is deeply rooted in the fertile soil of excellent traditional Chinese culture, draws on the wisdom and essence of traditional Chinese philosophy, blends with the people's common values that they use daily without being aware of it, embodies the CPC's values of ""the people for the state"" and ""the world for the public"", and its vision of ""one world, one family"", as well as the values of the Chinese people accumulated over a long period of time in their productive lives. It is a philosophical example of adherence to historical and cultural self-confidence, the use of the past for the present, and the promotion of the new. The ""six must be insisted upon"" enriches and develops the worldview and methodology of Marxism. The ""six must adhere to"" is a crystallization of the wisdom of the CPC in the historical process of promoting the Chineseization of Marxism, condensing the history of the Party's ideological exploration and theoretical innovation in the pursuit of truth, the revelation of truth, and the practice of truth. Along the way, the Party has always accurately grasped the regularity of scientific theoretical innovation, and has always insisted that ""China's problems must be answered by the Chinese themselves from the perspective of China's basic national conditions"", and has successively founded Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and formed the ""Three Represents"" Important Thought, the Scientific Development Principles, and the ""Three Principles"" Important Thought. ""Three Represents"", the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era have provided the Party and the people with scientific theoretical guidance that is both inherited and up-to-date, and have opened up a new realm for the modernization of Chinese Marxism. The ""six must be adhered to"" has inspired the philosophical thinking of the world's people in exploring the road to modernization. ""Copying and reproducing other countries' experiences and models can never lead to success."" The successful practice of China's theory, China's road and China's system in the new era fully demonstrates that the ""six must be adhered to"" is a scientific worldview and methodology, which provides not a ready-made model but a methodology that all countries can learn from, and offers an opportunity for countries and peoples in the world that wish to accelerate their development but also wish to maintain their independence to follow a path that suits their own national conditions. It provides a brand-new choice for those countries and peoples in the world that wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence at the same time to follow a path that is in line with their own national conditions, and contributes Chinese wisdom and solutions to the progress of human civilization and the peaceful development of the world. The ""six must be adhered to"" is an interlocking and internally unified organic whole, building a system of thought and theory for understanding and transforming the world. Only by accurately grasping the ""six must adhere to"" can we learn and understand Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics for the new era. To adhere to Marxism, the most important thing is to adhere to the basic principles of Marxism and the standpoints and methods that run through it. As early as during the Yan'an period, Comrade Mao Zedong suggested in ""Transforming Our Learning"" that many comrades ""would only quote one-sidedly the individual words and phrases of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, rather than applying their positions, viewpoints, and methods to concretely study China's present situation and China's history, and concretely analyze the problems of the Chinese revolution and solve the Chinese revolutionary problems..."". "". The ""six must be adhered to"" follow the logical chain from ""position"" to ""viewpoint"" to ""method"", constituting an interconnected and mutually supportive chain. The six must be adhered to follow a logical chain from ""position"" to ""point of view"" to ""method"", constituting an interrelated and mutually supportive system of thought. Only by accurately grasping the connotations and theoretical logic of the ""six must be insisted upon"" can we get the ideological method right, recognize the problem to stand high, analyze the problem to see the depth, and carry out the work accurately. Marxist philosophy is the unity of theoretical value and practical value. All along, our party has been working for the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as for the progress of mankind and the commonwealth of the world. With the theoretical attitude of self-confidence, self-reliance and innovation, and the practical path of problem orientation and systematic conception, the ""six must be adhered to"" has solved the problem of ""bridge and boat"" for realizing the mission and tasks of the Party in the new era and new journey. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, a series of major deployments related to national economy and people's livelihood such as precise poverty alleviation, epidemic prevention and control, and a series of Chinese programs related to global governance such as promoting the common values of all mankind and constructing a community of human destiny are vivid footnotes of the ""six must adhere to"". The ""six must insist"" is a systematic methodology formed by the Party in the course of its unusual and extraordinary history, based on the scientific identification of the historical orientation of China's development, the main contradiction and strategic planning, and the accurate identification of changes, scientific response to changes, and the initiative to seek changes. It contains the principled method of standing firm and maintaining stability, the strategic method of grasping the general situation and thinking far ahead, and the tactical method of integrating all aspects and making key breakthroughs. We must further study and master the ""six must adhere to"", for forward-looking thinking, global planning, holistic advancement of all undertakings and work to provide scientific thinking and methodological guidance. Four ""six must adhere to"" highlights the ""unity of knowledge and action"" philosophical character, for us to crack the problem of the times, grasp the historical initiative, create a bright future provides a scientific worldview and methodology. On the way forward, no matter how much the situation changes and how severe the challenges are, we should firmly believe in the power of truth, adopt a self-confident and self-reliant attitude, a spirit of righteousness and innovation, and a pattern of thinking of the world, firmly grasp the political and directional issues of principle, profoundly recognize the interaction between our own development and the external environment, set up a correct outlook on the world's pattern and its evolution in terms of the historical viewpoint, the big picture viewpoint and the viewpoint of the role of the world, and firmly stand on the right side of history and the right side of the progress of mankind. Stand firmly on the right side of history, on the side of human progress, and in the midst of the chaos of flowers and clouds, soberly grasp the time and situation, and dialectically study and judge the danger and opportunity. Marxism is essentially a critical and revolutionary theory. Learning and mastering the ""six must adhere to"", we must comprehend the spiritual character of facing the problems, taking the bull by the horns and rising to the challenge, always reviewing the self with the knife edge inward, adhering to the tone of strictness, maintaining a high-pressure situation, deepening the root causes and symptoms of the problem, persevering in promoting a comprehensive and rigorous governance of the Party, and promoting the construction of the Party's new great project in the new era. , constantly removing viruses that erode the healthy body of the Party, and ensuring that the Party never deteriorates in quality, color or taste with the sobriety and firmness that solves the unique problems of large parties. At present, the international situation is complex and volatile, dare to struggle, good at struggle, we will be able to overcome all the difficulties and challenges of the road ahead. With the methodology of ""six must adhere to"", we must observe and recognize the strong enemy and opponent with a universally linked, comprehensive and systematic, development and change of viewpoints, grasp the military and political, war and peace, stabilize and shape the situation, deterrence and actual combat, people and weapons and other major relationships, and always maintain a strategic sobriety and a bottom-line thinking on the risks of war that may occur. In the past, the military has been able to plan for, respond to, and act in accordance with the situation, strongly deter war, and resolutely fight and win wars. Now, the cause of military strength is in the critical period of climbing over the hurdles, we should always be along the direction of President Xi's guidance courageous and resolute, upholding the ""six must adhere to the"" world view and methodology, the use of systematic concepts, adhere to the problem-oriented, open up the horizons of the pattern, to come up with new concepts to solve the problem of the new ideas and new ways of new ways of making up for the shortcomings, Weaknesses will be strengthened, and a scientific worldview and methodology will be provided to guide the cause of strengthening the military in the new era. (Author's unit: Western Theater Air Force)","The ""Six Must Adhere To"" are six fundamental principles that were put forth by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in order to guide their actions and thought in the pursuit of their goals. These principles are self-confidence and self-reliance, righteousness and innovation, problem orientation, a systematic conception, the world, and the people. These principles embody the philosophy of the CPC and serve as a guide for their actions and decision-making processes. The ""Six Must Adhere To"" are deeply rooted in Marxist philosophy and have been developed and utilized by the CPC in order to continue to move towards systematization and maturity in their ideology and theory.

In the article ""The Party Must Courageously Engage in Self-Revolution"" in Volume 1 of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, President Xi profoundly pointed out, ""To revitalize and strengthen the Party, we must realistically understand and grasp ourselves. ensure that the Party remains vital, it must know and grasp itself realistically, and build and refine itself in the spirit of courageous self-revolution."" This important statement by President Xi clarifies the extreme importance of self-revolution for the party to maintain its advancement and purity and become a Marxist ruling party that cannot be defeated or crushed, reflecting the sense of anxiety of a century-old party in times of peace and the political self-awareness of the party to develop and strengthen the party. The courage to self-revolution is the distinguishing mark of our party from other political parties, and it is the secret of its success that it has jumped out of the historical periodicity of rule and chaos and has become more energetic through the vicissitudes of the past hundred years. As the world's largest party, there is no external force that can defeat us, and the only one that can defeat us is ourselves. In the face of the historical mission of building a strong modern socialist country and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization, in the face of the major challenges of high winds and waves and even terrifying waves on the road ahead, and in the face of the long-standing ""four major tests"" and ""four dangers"", President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the ""four major tests"" and ""four dangers"". ""President Xi has repeatedly emphasized self-revolution, pointing out that ""the more onerous the task, the greater the risks and tests, the more important to carry forward the spirit of self-revolution"" ""the Party's self-revolution is a heavy task and a long way to go. Party members and cadres must deeply understand the significance of self-revolution for the success or failure of the party's cause, and always maintain the sobriety of catching up with the test, and the spirit of self-revolution to build and refine their own, so that the party will always remain advanced and pure, and will always remain vitality and vigor. Courageous self-revolution, must replenish calcium and strong bones, detoxification and sterilization. President Xi pointed out that self-revolution is to replenish calcium, detoxify and sterilize the bones, break the wrists, remove the rotting muscles, constantly remove the virus that erodes the healthy body of the party, constantly improve its immunity, and prevent the death of the government. In the long-term ruling conditions, all kinds of factors that weaken the party's advancement and damage the party's purity are everywhere, and all kinds of dangers that violate the original mission and shake the foundation of the party are everywhere. History and practice have proved that Marxist faith, the lofty ideals of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics are the spiritual pillars and political souls of the CPC, and that only with firm faith and beliefs can we remove impurities, get rid of viruses, and prevent pollution, and truly realize self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, and self-improvement. The majority of party members and cadres is to firmly grasp the ideals and beliefs as an eternal subject, regardless of the waves or thorns in the road, are able to maintain the ""chaotic clouds still calm"" political strength, not for all kinds of temptation; to maintain the ""10,000 bells in my why add to it"" noble quality, not for all kinds of gains and losses. Quality, not to be disturbed by all kinds of gains and losses; to maintain the ""long wind and waves will sometimes"" high morale, not to be blocked by all kinds of difficulties, so that the torch of ideals and beliefs in the heart of the burning, selfless, fearless, and charge in the party and the people where they need it most. Courageous self-revolution, we must adhere to the truth and correct errors. President Xi pointed out that our Party always promotes social revolution while courageously promoting self-revolution, always adheres to the truth and corrects errors, and dares to face up to problems and overcome shortcomings. Looking back on a hundred years of party history, the greatness of the CPC lies not in not making mistakes, but in never avoiding illnesses, daring to face up to problems, courageous in self-revolution, and possessing an extremely strong self-repairing ability. People are not sages, who can not make mistakes. Party members and cadres, the error is not terrible, the error can not choose to escape, but to know over that change, always keep as thin ice, know stop there is a sober vigilance, in order to face the problem, the determination to change the courage, in the review of the problem, correcting errors and change in the growth of the pluck. To adhere to the principle must always adhere to, the gate must be firmly guarded firmly, never right and wrong, unclear position, never look forward and backward, fearful, never knowingly, swaying; but also to ""do not have to, ask for their own"" attitude to examine their own, do not avoid the problem, do not shirk their responsibilities, do not write off the wrongs, have the courage to face up to the problem, have the courage to face up to the problem, have the courage to correct the wrongs. Problems are brave to face up to, there are mistakes to shoulder the responsibility, there are mistakes to admit and actively correct. Courageous self-revolutionary, must knife edge to the inside, scraping the bones. President Xi pointed out that how to be considered tough is to dare to carry out self-revolution, dare to turn the blade inward, dare to scrape the bones and heal the wounds. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has pushed forward with a thunderous force the overall strict governance of the Party, opened the knife to the intractable miasma within the Party, and took drastic medicines to get rid of the disease, and cured the chaos with heavy grace, so that the Party has become stronger and more powerful in the revolutionary forging. To continue to promote the new era of the Party's construction of a new great project, we must always adhere to the main tone of strict and unshakeable, put discipline and rules in the forefront, catch the early and small, to prevent the slightest gradual; carry forward the spirit of nails, persevere in the implementation of the spirit of the Central Committee of the spirit of the eight provisions, the spirit of the Military Commission of the spirit of the ten provisions and their implementation rules, resolutely correct and cure formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance, and resolutely resist privileged thinking, privileged behavior; Punish corruption with zero tolerance, dare to fight, good at fighting, adhere to not dare to rot, can not rot, do not want to rot as one to promote, punishment and deterrence, institutional constraints, and improve awareness as one. Party members and cadres should diligently dust ""thought dust"", think more ""greed harm"", often break the ""thief in the heart"", no delusional thoughts to ensure that there is no delusional action outside, and effectively guard the doer, handle, use power, and interact with the bottom line. The bottom line is to take every step in life. President Xi emphasized that the overall strict governance of the party is always on the road, the party's self-revolution is always on the road, there must be no relaxation, fatigue and boredom. The one who walks a hundred miles is half ninety. If you are hot before and cold after, tight before and loose after, you will lose all your efforts. At present, the Chinese nation is closer to, more confident and capable of realizing the goal of great rejuvenation than at any other time in history, but the closer we get to success, the bigger the storm, the more we need to unswervingly promote the Party's self-revolution, maintain strategic stability, and keep a clear head. Party members and cadres to implement this requirement, we must always bear in mind that ""iron still needs its own hard"" reasoning, adhere to the strict word at the head, a strict in the end, to promote the overall strict governance of the party to continue to lead to deeper and deeper; always lead from the top, the first level of demonstration to the first level to see, the first level of the first level of work, lead and drive the majority of officers and soldiers to practice good war, thick war can; Always with the ""success does not have to be in my"" frame of mind, a blueprint drawn to the end, a hammer after a hammer, with a stone to leave a mark, grasp the iron with traces of style to grasp the preparation for war and the implementation of all the work; always bear in mind the mission of the original heart, to maintain sobriety and firmness in solving the big party's unique problems, to keep up with the pace of the times, to forge a strong fortress to overcome the challenges of the new era and new challenges of the new era. We will take on the role of a new era and a new journey to win a new and greater victory.","The article emphasizes the importance of self-revolution for the Party to maintain its advancement and purity. President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the significance of self-revolution, highlighting that the Party must be courageous in engaging in self-revolution to build and refine itself."
以实干作风把各项工作落到实处 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：印言蹊 责任编辑：张硕 2023-05-23 07:24:58 0,以实干作风把各项工作落到实处 ■印言蹊 ●拿出真抓的实劲、敢抓的狠劲、善抓的巧劲、常抓的韧劲，以“时时放心不下”的责任感履职尽责、担当作为，努力把各项工作落到实处，在推动事业发展上实现新突破 空谈误国，实干兴邦。在《习近平著作选读》第一卷《实干才能梦想成真》一文中，习主席要求各级领导干部“出实策、鼓实劲、办实事，不图虚名，不务虚功，坚决反对干部群众反映强烈的形式主义、官僚主义、享乐主义和奢靡之风‘四风’，以身作则带领群众把各项工作落到实处”。作为国防和军队建设的中坚力量，军队党员干部特别是领导干部使命在肩、责任重大，应当牢记习主席嘱托，立身为旗作表率，担当作为抓落实，以求实的思想作风、扎实的工作作风、务实的领导作风，奋力推进新时代强军事业。 “为者常成，行者常至。”实干是中华民族一以贯之的优秀品格，也是我们党的光荣传统和优良作风。党的十八大以来，习主席反复强调要崇尚实干、狠抓落实，反对“四风”、改进作风，指出“我们靠实干创造了辉煌的过去，还要靠实干开创更加美好的未来”。新时代十年党和国家事业取得的历史性成就、发生的历史性变革充分证明，伟大事业成于实干。抓基层、打基础靠实干，化危机、育新机靠实干，开新局、建新功也要靠实干，“不干，半点马克思主义都没有”。挺立潮头，需要艰苦奋斗；干在实处，才能走在前列。当前，国防和军队建设站在新的历史起点上，处于爬坡过坎、转型发展的关键时期，面临的内外形势纷繁复杂，矛盾问题交织叠加，风险挑战前所未有。越是任务艰巨，越要真抓实干；越是时间紧迫，越要紧抓快干。党员干部唯有以实干作风把各项工作落到实处，以顽强奋斗开创事业发展新天地，才能不负时代、不辱使命，无愧于党和人民重托。 “担当作为就要真抓实干、埋头苦干，决不能坐而论道、光说不练。”习主席多次讲过两晋学士“虚谈废务”的历史教训，对现实中那些夸夸其谈、不干实事的人提出严肃批评。再好的目标和蓝图，如果不抓落实，也只是镜中花、水中月。这就要求党员干部端正工作态度，树立正确的权力观、政绩观、事业观，涵养“功成不必在我、功成必定有我”的精神境界和历史担当，不驰于空想，不骛于虚声。一方面，应紧贴实际调查研究，沉到基层把脉问诊，铆在一线解剖麻雀，切实把情况摸清、把问题找准，使制订的方案计划符合实际情况、符合客观规律、符合科学精神，不拍脑门决策、凭感觉指挥。另一方面，应着眼实效推动工作，多一些脚踏实地、求真务实，少一些表面文章、花拳绣腿，拿出真抓的实劲、敢抓的狠劲、善抓的巧劲、常抓的韧劲，以“时时放心不下”的责任感履职尽责、担当作为，努力把各项工作落到实处，在推动事业发展上实现新突破。 习主席指出：“要培养担当实干的工作作风，不尚虚谈、多务实功，勇于到艰苦环境和基层一线去担苦、担难、担重、担险，老老实实做人，踏踏实实干事。”“七一勋章”获得者、“时代楷模”黄大发，带领村民历时36年，在悬崖绝壁上开凿出一条主渠长7200米、支渠长2200米的“生命渠”，用实干兑现“水过不去、拿命来铺”的誓言，为改善山区群众用水条件、实现脱贫致富作出突出贡献。急难险重任务最能考验实干作风，棘手矛盾问题最能折射党性修养。前进的道路从来不会是一片坦途，如果遇到挫折坎坷就畏葸不前，那么实干就是一句空话。艰难方显勇毅，磨砺始得玉成。如何做到攻坚克难？具体来说，就是要敢于担当责任，无论什么时候，该做的事知重负重，顶着压力也要干，该负的责挺身而出，冒着风险也要担；勇于直面矛盾，不怕惹麻烦，不怕挨板子，敢啃“硬骨头”，敢接“烫手山芋”；善于解决问题，运用马克思主义立场观点方法，创造性提出破解难题的思路举措，同时抓好成果运用，使解决问题的过程成为推动工作、优化决策、提高能力的过程。 习主席强调，各级要强化执行力，把各项任务落到实处，不能打折扣，不能搞变通。强大的执行力是实干精神、实干作风的生动体现。反观当下，有的同志拿“按规矩办、等上级定”作“挡箭牌”，该本级负责的层层请示，该亲力亲为的当“甩手掌柜”；有的同志搞“选择性拖延”，遇到困难问题能推就推、能躲就躲，这些都与形势任务要求极不相符。国防和军队现代化建设已经按下“快进键”，尤其需要党员干部保持闻令而动、雷厉风行的工作作风，以等不起、慢不得的紧迫感抓好工作落实，让“马上就办”形成习惯、蔚然成风。应坚持“今天再晚也是早，明天再早也是晚”，对作出的部署、承诺的事项，立说立行、掷地有声；对制订的计划、待办的工作，力求事不过夜、案无积卷，在“马上就办”中跑出加速度，在“办就办好”中干出高质量。特别是对涉及官兵切身利益的急难愁盼问题，要积极践行“群众利益无小事、一枝一叶总关情”的理念，真正在做好每一件小事、完成每一项工作、履行每一项职责中见精神。 今天，我们正在全面建设社会主义现代化国家的新征程上昂扬奋进，新征程是充满光荣和梦想的远征，没有捷径，唯有实干。只要我们锚定奋斗目标，立愚公移山之志，积滴水穿石之功，一步一个脚印，踏踏实实干好工作，就一定能把美好蓝图变为现实，创造出属于我们这一代人的一流业绩。 （作者单位：海军军医大学）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230525000440/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225987.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230523042915/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16225987.html,2023-05-25 0:00:00,With the style of practical work to put the work into practice Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Yin Yanqi Responsibility: Zhang Shuo 2023-05-23 07:24:58 0,"The style of practical work to put the work into practice ■ YinYinKing ● come up with a real grasp of the real force, dare to grasp the hard force, good grasp of the clever force, always grasp the tenacity, to ""always rest assured that"" sense of responsibility to perform their duties, take on the role of, and strive to put all the work into practice, to promote the development of the cause of the realization of new breakthroughs Empty talk is misleading, the practical work of the state. In the first volume of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, President Xi asked leading cadres at all levels to ""come up with practical measures, drum up practical efforts, do practical things, do not try to make a name for themselves, do not make any false efforts, and resolutely oppose the cadres and the masses to reflect the strong formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance of the 'four winds', and set an example by performing their duties. ', lead the masses by example to put all the work into practice."" As the backbone of national defense and military construction, military party members and cadres, especially the leading cadres mission in the shoulders, a great responsibility, should bear in mind the President Xi's entrusted, stand up for the flag as an example, take on the role of grasping the implementation of the realistic style of thinking, solid style of work, practical style of leadership, and strive to promote the cause of a strong army in the new era. ""The one who does is always successful, the one who does is always there."" Pragmatism is a consistent and excellent character of the Chinese nation, and it is also the glorious tradition and fine style of our Party. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the need to advocate practical work, pay close attention to implementation, oppose the ""four winds"" and improve the style of work, pointing out that ""we have created a glorious past by practical work, but also rely on practical work to create an even better future"". The historic achievements and changes of the Party and the country in the past decade of the new era have fully proved that great undertakings are realized through practical work. Grasping the grassroots, laying the foundation depends on solid work, the crisis, nurturing new opportunities rely on solid work, open a new situation, build new skills also rely on solid work, ""do not do, half of Marxism are not"". Standing at the head of the tide, need to work hard; dry in the field, in order to walk in the forefront. At present, the national defense and military construction is standing on a new historical starting point, in a critical period of climbing the slope, transformation and development, facing the complexity of the internal and external situation, contradictions and problems are intertwined and overlapping, and the risks and challenges are unprecedented. The more arduous the task, the more we must really do; the more time is short, the more we must grasp and do quickly. Party members and cadres only to the style of work to put the work into practice, to tenacious struggle to create a new world of career development, in order to live up to the times, not to dishonor the mission, worthy of the party and the people entrusted. ""Take on the role as we have to really work, head down and work hard, never sit and talk, just talk."" President Xi has repeatedly talked about the history of the two jin bachelor ""vain talk waste business"", the reality of those who boast, not do the actual work of the people put forward serious criticism. Even the best goals and blueprints, if you do not grasp the implementation, it is only a flower in the mirror, the moon in the water. This requires party members and cadres to correct their work attitude, establish a correct view of power, performance and career, and cultivate the spirit of ""success does not have to be in me, success must have me"" and historical responsibility, not in the empty thoughts, not overly ambitious. On the one hand, should be close to the actual investigation and research, sunk to the grassroots pulse diagnosis, riveted to the front line of the anatomy of the sparrow, and effectively to find out the situation, to find the problem, so that the development of programs and plans in line with the actual situation, in line with the objective laws, in line with the spirit of science, do not shoot at the brain decision-making, based on the feeling of command. On the other hand, should focus on the effectiveness of the work, more down-to-earth, pragmatic, less superficial articles, flowery fist, take out the real grasp of the real force, dare to grasp the force, good grasp of the skillful force, the tenacity of the constant grasp, to ""when the assured"" sense of responsibility to perform their duties, take on the role of action, and strive to put all the work into effect, and to achieve new breakthroughs in the promotion of the cause of development. The development of the cause to achieve new breakthroughs. President Xi pointed out: ""We should cultivate a work style of bearing practical work, do not talk, more practical work, the courage to go to the difficult environment and grassroots front line to bear the pain, bear the difficulty, bear the weight, bear the danger, honestly do people, down-to-earth officers."" Huang Dafa, winner of the ""July 1 Medal"" and ""Model of the Times"", led the villagers for 36 years to carve out a 7200-meter-long main canal and 2,200-meter-long branch canal on the cliffs, and honored the ""life canal"" with his hard work. ""with practical work to fulfill the ""water can not pass, take the life to pave"" vow, to improve the water conditions of the mountain people, to achieve poverty alleviation and prosperity to make outstanding contributions. The most difficult and dangerous tasks can test the style of practical work, the most difficult contradictory problems can be refracted party spirit cultivation. The road ahead will never be a straight road, if you encounter setbacks and bumps on the fear of insecurity, then do is an empty word. Hard to show courage, sharpening to get jade. How to do to overcome difficulties? Specifically, it is to dare to take responsibility, no matter what time, the thing to do to know the weight of the burden, under pressure to do, the responsibility to step forward, at the risk of also want to bear; the courage to face the contradictions, not afraid of trouble, not afraid of the board, dare to gnaw the ""hard bones"", dare to take the ""hot potatoes! ""; good at solving problems, the use of Marxist position and viewpoint methods, creatively put forward ideas and initiatives to crack the problem, and at the same time to grasp the results of the application, so that the problem-solving process to promote the work, optimize the decision-making process, improve the ability. President Xi emphasized that all levels should strengthen execution and put all tasks into practice without discounts or variations. Strong execution is a vivid embodiment of the spirit of practical work and style of practical work. In contrast, some comrades take ""according to the rules, such as the higher-ups set"" as a ""shield"", the level responsible for the layers of instructions, the hands-on when the ""shirker""; some comrades engage in ""Selective procrastination"", encountering difficulties and problems can be pushed to push, can hide to hide, these are with the situation and mission requirements are extremely inconsistent. National defense and military modernization has pressed the ""fast-forward button"", especially the need for party members and cadres to maintain the order to move, thunder and lightning style of work, with the sense of urgency can not afford to wait, can not be slowed down to grasp the implementation of the work, so that the ""immediately on the"" form a habit, become a trend. Should adhere to the ""late today is also early, tomorrow is also late"", the deployment made, the commitment of the matter, said immediately, sound; the development of the plan, to be done, and strive to do things overnight, the case is not a backlog of volumes, in the ""do it now"" in the acceleration! In the ""do it now"" to run out of acceleration, in the ""do it well"" to do a high-quality. Especially for the urgent, difficult and worrying problems involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers, we should actively practice the concept of ""no small matter in the interests of the masses, one branch and one leaf is always concerned"", and really see the spirit in doing every small thing, completing every job and fulfilling every duty. Today, we are marching forward on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, and the new journey is an expedition full of glory and dreams, with no shortcuts but practical work. As long as we anchor the goal of the struggle, the will to set up a fool's errand, the accumulation of water penetrating the stone, one step at a time, step by step, and do a good job, we will be able to turn the beautiful blueprint into reality, to create a first-class performance belonging to our generation.

一、必须在以学铸魂上下功夫见实效，不断筑牢思想根基，坚定理想信念 进入新时代，我国正经历着国家历史上最为广泛而深刻的社会变革，进行着人类历史上最为宏大而独特的实践创新。以习近平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，坚持把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合，创立了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，实现了马克思主义中国化时代化新的飞跃。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，不断回答中国之问、世界之问、人民之问、时代之问，作出符合中国实际和时代要求的正确回答，得出符合客观规律的科学认识，构成一个完整的科学体系。实践一再告诉我们，中国共产党为什么能，中国特色社会主义为什么好，归根到底是马克思主义行，是中国化时代化的马克思主义行。党的十八大以来的无数客观事实反复表明，习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，深刻彰显对马克思主义的信仰、对中国特色社会主义的信念、对实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的信心，是新时代中国共产党人的思想旗帜、精神旗帜，是全党全国各族人民为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗的行动指南，必须长期坚持并不断发展。正是因为有习近平总书记掌舵领航，有习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想科学指引，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，我国迈上全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程。 用党的创新理论武装全党是党的思想建设的根本任务。党的二十大报告提出，“坚持不懈用新时代中国特色社会主义思想凝心铸魂”“坚持用新时代中国特色社会主义思想统一思想、统一意志、统一行动”。4月13日，习近平总书记在广东考察时指出，“以学铸魂，就是要做好学习贯彻新时代中国特色社会主义思想的深化、内化、转化工作，从思想上正本清源、固本培元，筑牢信仰之基、补足精神之钙、把稳思想之舵。”这次主题教育在具体目标中明确提出“凝心铸魂筑牢根本”“锤炼品格强化忠诚”，就是要求我们要全面、系统、深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，完整准确掌握这一重要思想的主要内容，全面把握这一重要思想的世界观、方法论和贯穿其中的立场观点方法，深刻理解这一重要思想的道理学理哲理；要求我们深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强忠诚核心、拥戴核心、维护核心、捍卫核心的政治自觉、思想自觉和行动自觉；要求我们自觉用党的创新理论改造主观世界，坚定理想信念、提升思想境界、加强党性锻炼，始终保持共产党人的政治本色，不断提高政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力。 理想信念是共产党人的政治灵魂，是共产党人经受住任何考验的精神支柱，也是党员干部安身立命之本。坚定的理想信念，永远是激励我们奋勇向前、克难制胜的不竭力量源泉。我国航天事业是党的事业、国家的事业、人民的事业，是护佑国家安全的战略基石，一代代航天人始终坚定理想信念，以党的旗帜为旗帜、以党的意志为意志、以党的使命为使命，不畏任何惊涛骇浪、攻克无数艰难险阻，推动航天事业从一穷二白走向欣欣向荣、迈向自信自强。我们坚持以学铸魂，就必须坚持用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想滋养初心、引领使命，扎实做好学习贯彻这一重要思想的深化、内化、转化工作，确保从思想上正本清源、固本培元，确保信仰之基筑得更牢、精神之钙补得更足、思想之舵把得更稳。一是必须深化为“使命担当”，要始终把这一重要思想作为发展之基、履责之本、成事之要，学深立场观点方法，学懂道理学理哲理，学出信仰信念信心，弘扬伟大建党精神，传承航天精神，厚植强党兴党之情，砥砺强国复兴之志，扛牢兴装强军之责，站稳人民立场，强化宗旨意识，为满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要贡献航天智慧和力量。二是必须内化为“虔诚至信”，要始终坚持旗帜鲜明讲政治，以深厚的政治感情拥护核心、信赖核心、爱戴核心、紧跟核心，把坚定捍卫“两个确立”、坚决做到“两个维护”作为最高政治原则和根本政治规矩，把“两个维护”体现到抓备战、谋打赢，抓创新、强发展，抓改革、善治理，抓管控、防风险的各项工作中，确保我国航天事业始终沿着党中央指引的方向奋力前进。三是必须转化为“真招实策”，要把这一重要思想转化为具体、精准、节点化的工作任务，充分运用理论学习之所悟、调查研究之所得、交流研讨之所思的成果，系统建立“四张清单”，构建形成学思践悟、知行合一的学习实践体系，不断推进党的创新理论创造性转化为指导实践、推动工作的强大力量。 二、必须在以学增智上下功夫见实效，不断提高履职本领，强化责任担当 5月17日，习近平总书记在听取陕西省委和省政府工作汇报时指出，“以学增智，就是要从党的科学理论中悟规律、明方向、学方法、增智慧，把看家本领、兴党本领、强国本领学到手。”马克思主义立场、观点、方法是做好工作的看家本领，是指导我们认识世界、改造世界的强大思想武器。注重加强理论武装是我们党不断从胜利走向新的胜利的重要法宝，用党的创新理论武装头脑是确保各项事业行稳致远的重要保障。新时代新征程，面对错综复杂的国际国内形势、艰巨繁重的改革发展稳定任务、各种不确定难预料的风险挑战，要实现以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的宏伟蓝图，迫切需要我们必须不断加强理论学习、厚实理论功底，自觉用新时代党的创新理论观察新形势、研究新情况、解决新问题，使各项工作始终朝着正确方向、按照客观规律推进。 航天强国是社会主义现代化强国的重要内涵和显著标志，航天事业是中国式现代化鸿篇巨著中的重要篇章。我们坚持以学增智，就必须善于从党的科学理论中悟规律、明方向、学方法、增智慧，善于从习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想中汲取奋发进取的强大智慧和强大力量，不断提升政治能力、思维能力、实践能力，熟练掌握其中蕴含的领导方法、思想方法、工作方法，增强干事创业、履职尽责的本领和工作水平，凝心聚力促发展，驰而不息抓落实，立足岗位作贡献，为推进中国式现代化贡献航天力量。一是必须增强识势之明，善于从党和人民的立场、党和国家工作大局出发想问题、作决策、办事情，善于从繁杂问题中把握事物的规律性、从苗头问题中发现事物的趋势性、从偶然问题中认识事物的必然性，练就准确识变、科学应变、主动求变的敏锐眼力，观察时代、把握时代、引领时代的战略眼光。二是必须提高干事之能，把习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的世界观、方法论和贯穿其中的立场观点方法转化为我们自觉掌握的科学思想方法，作为研究问题、解决问题的“总钥匙”。要坚持人民至上，提高服务群众、依靠群众、凝聚群众的能力；坚持自信自立，提高自力更生、自主创新、科技自立自强的能力；坚持守正创新，提高精益管理、科学决策、创新创造的能力；坚持问题导向，提高预判风险、化危为机、深化改革的能力；坚持系统观念，增强前瞻性思考、全局性谋划、整体性推进的能力；坚持胸怀天下，提高应对变局、服务全局、心系大局和融入新发展格局的能力。三是必须掌握成事之道，以党的创新理论为根本遵循，增强推动高质量发展本领、服务群众本领、防范化解风险本领，加强斗争精神和斗争本领养成，提高解决各种复杂问题的意识和能力，确保在面对各种矛盾问题和风险挑战时，做到方向明确、头脑清醒、应对有方、行动有力。

Ideal belief is the political soul of communists, is the spiritual pillar of communists to withstand any test, but also the party cadres to settle down. Firm ideals and beliefs will always be an inexhaustible source of strength to inspire us to move forward and overcome difficulties. China's space industry is the cause of the party, the cause of the country, the people's cause, is to protect the national security of the strategic cornerstone, generations of astronauts have always been firm ideals and beliefs, to the party's flag for the flag, the party's will for the will of the party, the party's mission for the mission, not afraid of any shocking waves, to overcome the myriad of obstacles and dangers, and to promote the aerospace industry from penniless to thriving, towards self-confidence and self-improvement.

Focus on strengthening the theoretical armament is our party constantly from victory to a new victory of the important treasure, armed with the party's innovative theory is to ensure that the cause of the important guarantee of stability and progress. A new journey in a new era, in the face of the intricate international and domestic situation, the arduous and burdensome task of reform, development and stability, and various uncertain and unpredictable risks and challenges, in order to realize the grand blueprint of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with a Chinese-style modernization, it is urgent for us to strengthen theoretical learning, solid theoretical foundation, and consciously use the innovative theories of the Party in the new era to observe the new situation, study the new situation, and solve the new problems, so that the work is always in the right direction. In this way, we can keep our work moving in the right direction and in accordance with the objective laws. Aerospace power is an important connotation and significant symbol of a strong socialist modernization country, and aerospace is an important chapter in the great work of Chinese-style modernization. If we insist on learning to enhance wisdom, we must be good at recognizing the laws, clarifying the direction, learning the methods and increasing the wisdom from the Party's scientific theories, and draw powerful wisdom and strength from Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, so as to continuously improve our political ability, thinking ability and practical ability, and skillfully master the methods of leadership, ideology and work contained therein, so as to enhance the abilities and work level of entrepreneurship and duty performance, and to concentrate our efforts on the development of our own country and the development of the space industry.

Strategic vision. Secondly, we must improve our ability to be an official, and transform the worldview, methodology and the standpoints and methods of Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era into a scientific method of thought that we consciously master, as the ""master key"" for studying and solving problems. We should adhere to the people first, improve the ability to serve the masses, rely on the masses, and rally the masses; adhere to self-confidence and self-reliance, improve the ability of self-reliance, independent innovation, and scientific and technological self-reliance and self-reliance; adhere to the right and innovation, improve the ability of lean management, scientific decision-making, and innovation and creativity; adhere to the problem orientation, improve the ability to anticipate risks, turn crises into opportunities, and deepen reforms; adhere to the systematic concept, and enhance the ability of forward-thinking, global planning, and holistic advancement.

Third, we must learn to correct the wind on the effort to see the effect, and constantly adhere to the self-revolution, set up a new style of the times Party style issues related to the survival of the ruling party. Comprehensive strict governance of the Party is always on the road, the Party's self-revolution is always on the road. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always maintained the sobriety and firmness to solve the unique problems of the big party, and has included comprehensively ruling the party strictly into the strategic layout of the ""Four Comprehensives"", and has found the second answer of self-revolution, which is the second answer of jumping out of the historical cycle rate of the rule of chaos and the rise and fall of the Party, and has made historic and pioneering achievements in comprehensively ruling the party strictly, and has had all-round and deep-level impact. It has had an all-round, deep-level impact. There is no stopgap in style construction, and style construction is always on the way. The report of the 20th Party Congress emphasized the need to ""carry forward the glorious tradition and fine style of the Party, and promote Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, to take the lead in in-depth investigation and research, and to get down to practical work, seek practical measures, and seek practical results. Perseverance in the implementation of the spirit of the eight provisions of the Central Committee, seize the 'key few' above the lead, continue to deepen the rectification of the 'four winds', focusing on the rectification of formalism, bureaucracy, and resolutely eliminating privileged thinking and privileged behavior."" Through this thematic education, we should further enhance the sense of discipline and rules, practice the ""Three Strictnesses and Three Truths"", strictly implement the strategic plan of the 20th Party Congress and the requirements of this thematic education, effectively strengthen the investigation and research, and strive to solve the outstanding problems, and be the leader and creator of a good political ecosystem and social atmosphere, We should be a good leader, creator and maintainer of a good political ecology and social atmosphere, and establish a new style of pragmatism and unity in the times. Style construction is an eternal subject, the key is to work on catching often, carefully, long and strictly. Since the new era, we adhere to the Xi Jinping new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics thought as a guide, grasp the historical initiative, carry the responsibility of the top beam, strengthen the style of construction, the aerospace industry has always been along the correct course of high-quality development, in a short period of time made a series of historic breakthroughs and historic achievements in the construction of major weaponry, manned spaceflight, the moon probe project, deep space exploration and so on. We insist on learning the right style, we must take the initiative to standardize Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era in the correction of deviation, sharpening the character, from which to draw the courage to self-revolutionary and power, bearing in mind that comprehensively strict governance of the Party is always on the way, the Party's self-revolution is always on the way, the construction of the style of work is always on the way, and constantly self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, and self-improvement.

Finding breakthroughs and focus points for high-quality development, finding ways to further promote innovation and enhancement initiatives, and promoting the solution of a number of development needs, urgent reforms, grassroots expectations, and the people's hearts and minds. Thirdly, we must carry forward the good style, continue to correct the ""four winds"", the strict, prudent and practical style of work through the entire process of theoretical learning and practice, accept the political physical examination, clean up the political dust, for the reform and development of enterprises and the party's construction of the existence of various contradictions and problems, from ideological, political, ability, style, discipline and other aspects of the party nature of the physical examination, focusing on correcting the formalism, the ability, style, discipline and other aspects of the party. Focus on rectifying the problems of formalism and bureaucracy, applying the scientific method of ""zeroing"" in the aerospace system, identifying the root causes of the problems, and escorting the high-quality development of the aerospace industry with the new wind of the times of pragmatism and unity. Fourth, we must learn to promote work on the effort to see the effect, and constantly strengthen the mission and responsibility to build a strong aerospace country The purpose of learning lies in the application. Practicality is the distinguishing feature of Marxist theory from other theories. Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is rooted in reality and responds to practical needs. It is not only the ""real scripture"" for transforming the subjective world and solving the problem of the ""general switch"", but also the ""golden key"" for transforming the objective world and solving the development problems. ""It is also the golden key for us to transform the objective world and solve the development problems. General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discussions on the development of the space industry and the construction of a strong spaceflight nation fully embody the vivid application of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in the military, spaceflight, and state-owned enterprise fields. When we study and implement Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we must always adhere to the ""vector"" of Chinese modernized Marxism to shoot the ""of"" the construction of a strong spacefaring nation in the new era, closely focus on the central task of the Party in the new era and the new journey, and enhance the ""development of equipment construction"" as the main goal of the Party. The Party will tightly focus on the central task of the new era and new journey, enhance the mission consciousness of ""making the equipment construction better and faster"", raise the crisis consciousness of ""lagging behind will be beaten"", resolutely win the battle of the key core technology, build more ""national important weapon"", promote the high-quality development, and make the aerospace industry more competitive in the new era.

Doing practical work will prosper the country, and struggling will strengthen the enterprise. General Secretary Xi Jinping admonished us, ""Officers and bearers are the duty of cadres and their value."" We must insist that whatever is beneficial to the Party and the people, we should not take refuge in things, not flee from responsibility, boldly do, resolutely do, and have the courage to bear the pain, bear the difficulty, bear the weight, bear the danger, and interpret the loyalty to the Party with practical actions.

知行论坛丨初心保质保鲜贵在持久滋养 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：沙先楼 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-08 07:17:01 0,初心保质保鲜贵在持久滋养 ■沙先楼 ●在不忘初心中保持先进性、纯洁性，在牢记使命中只争朝夕、拼搏奋进，让初心在鼙鼓催征的强军赛道上书写最美奋斗篇章 不忘初心、牢记使命，是加强党的建设的永恒课题，也是全体党员干部的终身课题。在《习近平著作选读》第二卷《不忘初心，牢记使命》一文中，习主席深刻指出：“初心不会自然保质保鲜，稍不注意就可能蒙尘褪色，久不滋养就会干涸枯萎，很容易走着走着就忘记了为什么要出发、要到哪里去，很容易走散了、走丢了。”不忘初心，方得始终。全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程上，我们要步履稳健地走好新的赶考之路，必须对初心进行持久滋养，让初心始终保质保鲜，永不变质、永不变色。如此，才能永远保持锐意进取、开拓创新的精气神和埋头苦干、真抓实干的原动力，不断把党的事业推向前进。 初心易得，始终难守。事实表明，马克思主义政党的先进性和纯洁性不会随着时间推移而自然保持下去，共产党员的党性也不会随着党龄增长和职务提升而自然提高。尤其置身复杂的社会环境，面对各种各样的糖衣炮弹和“围猎”陷阱，如果不及时进行呵护和滋养，初心就会蒙尘、会干涸。那些跌入违法违纪深渊的党员干部，之所以会在错误道路上越走越远，根本原因就是丢掉了初心、忘记了使命。他们不是不知道“房子要经常打扫，镜子要经常擦拭”的道理，而是疏于行动，热一阵子冷一阵子，紧一阵子松一阵子，对初心不能做到持久滋养，久而久之，原本纯洁纯净的初心渐渐变得浑浊不清，直到最终发生病变，迷失自我、栽了跟头。许多事实证明，只有持久滋养初心，常晒“阳光”常补钙，常掸思想上的“灰尘”，构筑形成拒腐防变的“隔离带”，才能让各种病菌无从进入，初心才能纤尘不染、新鲜如初。 “共产党人的初心，不仅来自于对人民的朴素感情、对真理的执着追求，更建立在马克思主义的科学理论之上。”注重思想建党、理论强党，是我们党的优良传统和独特优势。从石库门到天安门，从兴业路到复兴路，中国共产党人跨过千山万水、闯过千难万险、经过千磨万击而初心如磐，在极端困境中勇毅前行，在濒临绝境中突出重围，在逆境挫折中毅然奋起，“虽九死其犹未悔”，依靠的正是党的理论的滋养和引领。“理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量”，可以清除一切侵蚀初心的病毒，为初心保质保鲜提供充足滋养和充分保证。相反，如果理论素养不扎实，精神家园杂草丛生，初心就会失去源头活水，就会变质变色。新征程上，广大党员干部要不断增强理论学习的自觉，勤修共产党人的“心学”，坚持学思用贯通、知信行统一，持之以恒从习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想中汲取丰厚养分，不断滋养初心、淬炼灵魂，增强对党的性质宗旨、理想信念和奋斗目标的高度认同，让信仰之基不松动、精神之钙不缺失、思想之舵不摇摆，做到历经沧桑而初心不改、饱经风霜而本色依旧。 “不忘初心、牢记使命不是一阵子的事，而是一辈子的事，每个党员都要在思想政治上不断进行检视、剖析、反思，不断去杂质、除病毒、防污染。”主动进行思想政治体检，强调的是心存敬畏、严于律己的高度自觉，体现的是克己修身、滋养初心的常态行为，增强的是自我约束、自我净化的过硬能力。在修身自省上，谢觉哉经常与自己“打官司”，彭德怀坚持“一月一省吾身”，陈毅“中夜尝自省”以便“改正再前行”……老一辈革命家这种主动检视初心的态度、勤于自省的品质、修正错误的勇气，为我们树立了光辉榜样。可以说，“检敕其身，常如不及”，是广大党员干部叩问初心、呵护初心的重要方法，党员干部应经常进行思想政治体检，同党中央要求“对标”，拿党章党规“扫描”，用人民群众新期待“透视”，同先辈先烈、先进典型“对照”，不断涵养共产党人的浩然正气，让初心始终不被灰尘所蒙蔽、不被物欲所俘获、不被利益所羁绊，做到对党忠诚一辈子，为人民服务一辈子，为理想追求一辈子。 恪尽职守、勤勉工作，既是弥足珍贵的政治品格，也是不容懈怠的从政本分，更是检验初心使命是否守得住、守得牢的重要标准。然而现实中一些党员干部，有的接受任务拈轻怕重，有的推动工作蜻蜓点水，有的处置矛盾畏首畏尾，有的遇到考验退避三舍……凡此种种，都是初心淡化、党性弱化、本色蜕化的表现。新征程是充满光荣和梦想的远征。广大党员干部始终做到初心如磐、使命在肩，重在知行合一、真抓实干，贵在担责尽责、知重负重，难在无私无我、无惧无畏，既要脚踏实地把本职工作干到极致、干出精彩，更要敢挑最重的担子、敢啃最硬的骨头，像排雷英雄杜富国那样挺身而出、冲锋在前，像“卫国戍边英雄团长”祁发宝那样守护国土、绝不后退，像载人航天团队那样矢志攀登、不懈奋斗，用风霜雪雨砥砺初心、磨砺党性，用知难而进淬炼筋骨、增长本领，初心就一定守得住，就一定能做到不辱使命、不负重托。 奋进强军新征程，军队党员干部要把持久滋养初心作为一种行为自觉、一种精神追求、一种品德修养，坚定“千磨万击还坚劲”的意志，激扬“越是艰险越向前”的勇气，在不忘初心中保持先进性、纯洁性，在牢记使命中只争朝夕、拼搏奋进，让初心在鼙鼓催征的强军赛道上书写最美奋斗篇章。 （作者单位：南京市秦淮区人武部）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230608234857/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16229671.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230608025241/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16229671.html,2023-06-09 0:00:00,Knowing and Doing Forum 丨初心保質保鲜贵在持久滋养 Source：中国军网-解放军报 作者：沙先楼 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-08 07:17:01 0,"The first heart of the preservation of quality and freshness of the noble in the lasting nourishment ■ Sha Xianlou ● in not forgetting the original heart to maintain the advanced nature, purity, in keeping the mission in mind in the struggle, so that the original heart of the drums and drums to urge the march of the strong military track to write the most beautiful chapter of the struggle Not forgetting the original heart, keeping the mission in mind, is to strengthen the construction of the Party's eternal subject, but also the lifelong subject of all party members and cadres. In Xi Jinping's works, volume II, ""not forgetting the original heart, remember the mission"" article, President Xi profoundly pointed out that: ""the original heart will not be naturally preserved, a little attention may be dusty and faded, long time not nourished will dry up and wither, it is easy to walk around forgetting why they want to set off, where they want to go, and easy to walk away from each other, and lose them. "" Not forgetting the original intention is the only way to achieve consistency. Comprehensively building a new journey of socialist modernization country, we have to walk steadily on the new road of catching up, we must carry out lasting nourishment of the original heart, so that the original heart always preserves the quality and freshness of the original heart, and never deteriorate, never change color. In this way, we can always maintain the spirit of enterprising, pioneering and innovative and hard work, the original power of real work, and constantly push the party's cause forward. The original heart is easy to get, always hard to keep. Facts show that the advancement and purity of Marxist political parties will not be maintained naturally with the passage of time, and the party nature of the Communist Party members will not be naturally improved with the growth of the party age and position. Especially in the complex social environment, in the face of a variety of sugar-coated shells and ""hunting"" traps, if not timely care and nourishment, the heart will be dusty, will dry up. Those who fell into the abyss of lawlessness and discipline party cadres, the reason why they will go further and further on the wrong road, the fundamental reason is to lose the original heart, forget the mission. They are not unaware of the ""house should be cleaned often, the mirror should be wiped often"" reasoning, but negligence in action, hot for a while cold for a while, tight for a while loose for a while, the heart can not do a lasting nourishment, over time, the original purity of the pure and pure heart gradually become muddy and unclear, until the final lesion, lost themselves, planted a heel! The first is the first time that the first heart is not nourished. Many facts have proved that only lasting nourishment of the heart, often sunshine ""sunshine"" often replenish calcium, often dust ""dust"" on the mind, constructing the formation of anti-corruption and prevention of ""isolation zone"", in order to let all kinds of Germs have no way to enter, the heart can be immaculate, fresh as the beginning. ""The original heart of the Communist Party not only comes from the simple feelings for the people and the persistent pursuit of truth, but also built on the scientific theory of Marxism."" Focusing on ideology to build the Party and theory to strengthen it is our Party's fine tradition and unique advantage. From Shikumen to Tiananmen Square, from Xingye Road to Fuxing Road, the Chinese Communist Party has crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, encountered thousands of difficulties and dangers, and gone through thousands of trials and tribulations, but its initial heart is as solid as a rock, and it has been courageous and determined to go forward in extreme difficulties, to stand out from the brink of extinction, to rise up in adversity and setbacks, and it has not regretted that it has died nine deaths, relying on the Party's theories to nourish and lead the Party. The Party's theory is the nourishment and leadership. ""Theory, once mastered by the masses, will also become a material force,"" which can remove all the viruses that erode the original heart, and provide sufficient nourishment and adequate guarantee for the preservation of the original heart. On the contrary, if the theoretical literacy is not solid, the spiritual home is overgrown with weeds, the initial heart will lose the source of living water, it will deteriorate and change color. On the new journey, the majority of Party members and cadres should constantly enhance the consciousness of theoretical learning, diligently cultivate the ""heart learning"" of communists, adhere to the unity of learning, thinking and using, and the unity of knowledge, faith and action, and consistently draw rich nutrients from Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, constantly nourish the original heart, quenching the soul, and enhance the quality and purpose of the Party, its ideals and beliefs, and the high degree of identity with the goal of struggle. The high degree of identification with the Party's nature and purposes, ideals and beliefs, and the goal of the struggle, so that the foundation of faith is not loose, the calcium of the spirit is not missing, the rudder of the mind does not sway, so that through the vicissitudes of life and the original heart does not change, weathered and the original color remains the same. ""Not forgetting the original mind, remembering the mission is not a matter of a while, but a lifetime, each party member should be in the ideological and political constantly review, analyze, reflect, and constantly remove impurities, in addition to the virus, anti-pollution."" Taking the initiative to conduct ideological and political physical examination, emphasizing the fear of the heart, a high degree of self-consciousness of strict self-discipline, embodied in self-cultivation, nourishing the original heart of the regular behavior, to enhance self-restraint, self-purification of the ability to be overly tough. In self-cultivation and introspection, Xie Jueya often with their own ""lawsuit"", Peng Dehuai insisted on ""a month a province of my body"", Chen Yi ""in the middle of the night to taste introspection"" so that the ""correct and then move forward"". ""Correct and then go forward""...... This attitude of the old revolutionaries to take the initiative to examine the original heart, the quality of diligent introspection, the courage to correct the mistakes, has set a shining example for us. It can be said that ""check its body, often as less than"", is the majority of party members and cadres inquiring about the initial heart, care of the initial heart of the important method, party members and cadres should often ideological and political physical examination, with the requirements of the Party Central Committee, ""standardized"", take the party rules and regulations, ""scanning"", ""scanning"", ""scanning"", ""scanning"", ""scanning"", ""scanning"", and ""scanning"". ""Scanning"", with the people's new expectations ""perspective"", with the forefathers and martyrs, advanced models ""control"", and constantly nourish the righteousness of the Communist Party, so that the original heart is always not clouded by dust, not by materialistic desires. The first is not to be blinded by dust, not to be captured by materialistic desires, not to be detained by interests, to be loyal to the party for life, to serve the people for life, to pursue the ideal for life. Diligence, diligence, both precious political character, but also can not slack off in politics, but also to test the mission of the original heart whether to keep, keep the important standard. However, the reality of some party members and cadres, some of the acceptance of the task is light and fearful, some of the promotion of work slapdash, some of the disposal of contradictions fearful of the end, some of the encounter with the test to avoid ...... wherever such, is the initial dilution of the party nature of the weakening of the character metamorphosis of the manifestation of the performance of the original spirit. The new journey is an expedition full of glory and dreams. The majority of party members and cadres always do the original mind like rock, mission in the shoulder, focusing on the unity of knowledge and action, real work, noble in the responsibility, know the weight of the weight, difficult to selflessness, fearless, not only to be down-to-earth to do their jobs to the extreme, out of the wonderful, and even more to dare to pick the heaviest burdens, dare to gnaw on the hardest bones, like the hero of the demining Du Fuguo stepped up to the forefront, like"" Guard the country garrison hero head"" Qifa Bao like guarding the country, never retreat, like the manned space team as determined to climb, unremitting struggle, with the frost and snow to sharpen the heart, sharpen the party nature, with the knowledge of the difficulties and progress to quench the sinews and bones, growth of skills, the original heart will certainly be able to keep, will certainly be able to do to fulfill the mission, to live up to the trust. Endeavoring to strengthen the new journey of the army, the army party members and cadres should nourish the original heart as a lasting behavioral consciousness, a spiritual pursuit, a moral cultivation, firm ""a thousand grinding ten thousand strikes is still strong"" will, and stimulate ""the more difficult and dangerous the more forward"" courage, in the not forgetting the original heart. Maintain the advanced nature, purity, in mind the mission in the struggle, hard work and progress, so that the heart in the drums and drums of the strong military track to write the most beautiful chapter of struggle. (Author's unit: Nanjing Qinhuai District People's Armed Forces Department)","The article highlights the importance of maintaining the quality and freshness of the noble in the lasting nourishment of the original heart. It emphasizes that without constant care and attention, the original heart can become dusty, dry up, and lose its purpose. The Communist Party members must constantly nourish their original hearts, learn from advanced examples, and maintain strict self-discipline. The Party's theory is the source of nourishment and leadership, and party members must actively engage in theoretical learning and self-purification. Regular ideological and political examinations can help identify and eliminate impurities, keep the original heart pure and true. In the new journey, party members and cadres must strive to serve the people with loyalty, dedication, and selflessness, and continually refine their original hearts."
调查研究须求真务实 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：翟月荧 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-06-07 08:26:55 0,调查研究是我们党重要的工作制度，也是我们党在不同历史时期做好各项工作的传家宝。习近平总书记指出：“要了解实际，就要掌握调查研究这个基本功。”今年3月，中共中央办公厅印发了《关于在全党大兴调查研究的工作方案》，深刻阐明了调查研究的极端重要性，对在全党大兴调查研究作出了系统部署。新征程上，我们既面临难得的发展机遇，又面临前所未有的风险挑战，迫切需要通过调查研究把握事物的本质和规律，找到破解难题的办法和路径。 所谓调查是指通过各种途径，运用各种方式方法，有计划、有目的地了解现实情况。研究则是指对调查材料进行去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的思维加工，以获得对客观事物本质和规律的认识。不论调查还是研究，都是追求真相的过程。这需要广大党员干部深入实际、深入基层、深入群众，全方位、多层次、多渠道地调查了解情况，真正把情况摸清，把问题找准，把对策提实。但在实际工作中，个别干部身上仍存在“蜻蜓点水、浅尝辄止”的走过场式调研，存在“层层陪同、迎来送往”的排面式调研，存在“只看规定动作、典型案例”的作秀式调研，存在“文山会海、闭门造车”的形式主义调研……凡此种种，严重背离了开展调查研究的初衷，妨碍了党的路线方针政策的贯彻落实，必须高度重视、坚决纠治。 知屋漏者在宇下，知政失者在草野。人民群众处在生产生活实践一线，对事物的观察更直接、对情况的了解更具体、对工作的把握更实在，是我们检验和深化认识的源头活水。大兴调查研究，就要坚持走党的群众路线，从群众中来、到群众中去，以满腔的热忱、“眼睛向下”的决心和“甘当小学生”的态度听真话、查实情，真诚倾听群众呼声、真实反映群众愿望、真情关心群众疾苦。要多一些“四不两直”式的调研，多到困难多、群众意见集中、工作打不开局面的地方去，多到田间地头、工厂车间与群众谈心，真正放下架子、扑下身子、沉下心去，在同群众近距离接触、面对面交流中，了解他们最真实的想法和最迫切的诉求。 马克思指出：“问题就是时代的口号，是它表现自己精神状态的最实际的呼声。”坚持问题导向，是我们党重要的思想方法和工作方法，也是调查研究取得实效的关键。调查研究必须坚持问题导向，增强问题意识，敢于正视问题，善于发现问题，以解决问题为根本目的。当年，陈云同志为研究种双季稻和种小麦的问题，先后到上海青浦县小蒸公社和与青浦县情况相仿的杭州、苏州几个县，以及与青浦县土地、人口、气候条件不同的萧山和无锡两县，调查了种植情况，研究了农作物种植安排上的有关问题，最后得出“种双季稻不如种蚕豆和单季稻”“多种小麦不如多种蚕豆”等结论。当前我们开展调查研究，必须增强问题意识，聚焦实践中遇到的新问题、改革发展稳定存在的深层次问题、人民群众急难愁盼问题、党的建设面临的突出问题等，不断提出真正解决问题的新理念新思路新办法。面对这样那样的问题，唯有敢于揭短亮丑，做到不掩饰、不遮盖，才能“对症下药”，开出切实解决问题的药方。 调研重在服务决策、指导工作、用于实践。衡量调查研究搞得好不好，不是看调查研究的规模有多大、时间有多长，也不是光看调研报告写得怎么样，关键要看调查研究的实效，看调研成果的运用，看能不能把问题解决好。要对调查得来的大量材料，进行深入细致地研究思考，把零散的认识系统化，把粗浅的认识深刻化，使我们更好抓住问题的本质，把握事物发展的规律，弄清全局和局部、当前和长远、宏观和微观、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、特殊和一般的关系，从而更好地为科学决策服务。要建立调研成果转化运用清单，加强对调研课题完成情况、问题解决情况的督查督办和跟踪问效，对短期内就能够转化的马上就办、紧抓快干，对一时无法转化的持续推进、一抓到底，对已经形成举措的及时跟踪评估、视情况优化调整，切实把调查研究成果转化为推进工作的实际成效。 ［作者单位：中央党校（国家行政学院）习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心］,https://web.archive.org/web/20230608234857/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16229355.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230607033751/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16229355.html,2023-06-09 0:00:00,Investigative research must be realistic and pragmatic Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zhai Yuefluent Editor-in-Chief: Li Jiaqi 2023-06-07 08:26:55 0,"Investigation and research is an important working system of our Party and an heirloom of our Party to do all the work well in different historical periods. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""to understand the actual situation, we must master the basic skill of investigation and research."" In March this year, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued the ""work program on the Party-wide survey and research"", which profoundly clarified the extreme importance of survey and research, and made a systematic deployment of the Party-wide survey and research. On the new journey, we are facing both rare development opportunities and unprecedented risks and challenges, there is an urgent need to grasp the essence and laws of things through investigation and research, and find ways and paths to solve problems. The so-called investigation refers to a variety of ways, using a variety of ways and means, planned and purposeful understanding of the reality. Research refers to the investigation of the material for the rough and refined, to remove the false and keep the true, from the other, from the surface to the inside of the thought processing, in order to obtain the understanding of the essence of the objective things and the law. Whether investigation or research, is the process of pursuing the truth. This requires the majority of party cadres in-depth practical, in-depth grass-roots, in-depth masses, all-round, multi-level, multi-channel investigation and understanding of the situation, the situation is really clear, to find the right problem, the countermeasures to mention the real. However, in practice, individual cadres still exist in the ""dragonfly, superficial"" of the passing research, there are ""layers of accompaniment, ushered in"" rows of face type research, there are ""only look at the provisions of the action, typical cases ""show-style research, there are"" mountains and seas, behind closed doors ""formalist research ...... All these kinds of serious departure from the original intention of conducting research, hindering the implementation of the party's lines and policies, we must The first step is to make sure that you have a good understanding of the situation. Knowing the leakage of the house in the Yu Xia, know the political failure in the grass field. The people are in the front line of production and life practice, the observation of things more directly, more specific understanding of the situation, grasp of the work is more real, is our test and deepen the understanding of the source of the living water. To promote investigation and research, we must adhere to the Party's mass line, come from the masses, go to the masses, listen to the truth with enthusiasm, ""eyes down"" determination and ""willing to be a student"" attitude, check the facts, sincerely listen to the voices of the masses, truly reflect the aspirations of the masses, and truly care about the plight of the masses. The public's aspirations, real concern for the plight of the masses. To more ""four not two straight"" type of research, more to the more difficult, the public opinion is concentrated, the work of the situation can not be opened to go, more to the fields, factories and workshops to talk to the masses, really put down their shelves, down to the body, sink into the heart of the masses in close contact with the masses, face-to-face exchanges, to understand their most real ideas and the most pressing The most important thing is to understand their most real ideas and most urgent demands. Marx pointed out that ""the problem is the slogan of the times, it is the most practical call to express their state of mind."" Adhering to the problem-oriented approach is an important ideological and working method of the Party, and it is also the key to the effectiveness of investigation and research. Survey and research must adhere to the problem orientation, enhance the problem awareness, dare to face up to the problem, good at discovering the problem, in order to solve the problem as the fundamental purpose. That year, comrade Chen Yun for the study of planting double-season rice and wheat, has to Shanghai Qingpu County, small steam commune and Qingpu County, similar to the situation in Hangzhou, Suzhou, several counties, as well as with the Qingpu County, land, population, climatic conditions are different from Xiaoshan and Wuxi counties, investigated the planting situation, the study of crop planting arrangements on the issue, and finally concluded that ""planting double-season rice is not as good as planting Fava beans and single-season rice"" ""a variety of wheat as a variety of beans"" and other conclusions. Currently we carry out research, we must enhance the awareness of the problem, focusing on the practice of encountering new problems, reform, development and stability of the existence of deep-rooted problems, the people's urgent problems and hopes, the party's construction of the outstanding problems, and constantly put forward a real solution to the problem of the new concepts and new ideas and new approaches. In the face of such and such problems, the only dare to expose the shortcomings of the ugly, do not cover up, do not cover up, in order to ""prescribe the right medicine"", to prescribe a practical solution to the problem. Research focuses on service decision-making, guidance, for practice. Measure the research is good, not to see how big the scale of the research, how long the time, but also not just look at how the research report is written, the key to look at the effectiveness of the research, look at the use of research results, to see if the problem can be solved. To investigate a large number of materials, in-depth and detailed research and thinking, the fragmented understanding of the systematization of the superficial understanding of the profound, so that we can better grasp the essence of the problem, grasp the law of the development of things, to clarify the overall situation and local, current and long-term, macro and micro, the main contradictions and secondary contradictions, the relationship between the special and the general, and thus better serve the scientific decision-making. To establish a research results into the use of the list, strengthen the completion of the research topic, problem solving supervision and tracking, on the short term can be transformed immediately, grasp the fast, for a moment can not be transformed to continue to promote, grasp to the end, has been the formation of initiatives in a timely manner to track and evaluate, depending on the circumstances of the optimization of adjustments, and effectively transform the results of the investigation and research into the actual results of the work of the promotional efforts. [Author's unit: Xi Jinping Research Center for Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Central Party School (National School of Administration)].","The article highlights the importance of investigation and research for understanding the actual situation and finding solutions to problems. It emphasizes the need to conduct thorough and purposeful investigations, listen to the voices of the masses, and focus on solving the people's urgent problems.

一个人经受的磨砺越多，距离成功就会越近 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李 悦 王 卓 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-13 07:04:12 0,“最不怕的就是困难” ■李 悦 王 卓 ●自身能力素质过硬，才能处变不惊，再大的困难都能克服。一个人经受的磨砺越多，距离成功就会越近 前不久，湖南科技大学教授万步炎被中央宣传部授予“时代楷模”称号，他的先进事迹经媒体报道后，引起热烈反响。 其中有一件事令人印象深刻：2021年，完成作业的“海牛Ⅱ号”正要从海底收回时意外“卡壳”，此时强台风即将到来，如果不能及时解决问题，就只能砍断脐带缆，把凝聚无数人心血制成的钻机丢弃在海底。面对这样紧急又艰难的情况，万步炎对大家说：“海上摸爬滚打这么多年，我们最不怕的就是困难！”于是，他带领团队找问题，争分夺秒做出了一套临时系统，在台风到来前两小时，成功将钻机完好无损地收回。万步炎这种“最不怕的就是困难”的精神，值得我们学习。 之所以“最不怕的就是困难”，是因为有过硬的能力素质。自身能力素质过硬，才能处变不惊，再大的困难都能克服。一次演练中，无锡联勤保障中心某团在输送介质时突遭泄漏，高空抢修员身穿全套防护装具，缓慢行走到悬在危崖上空且摇晃不止的受损点。在泄漏点喷出的雾花严重阻碍视野的情况下，抢修员近乎盲操，仅用时4分多钟就完成了堵塞补漏和更换部件等抢修工作。如果没有过硬的能力素质，是不可能完成这项任务的。只有能力素质过硬，遇到困难才能不慌不乱，从容镇定地找到解决办法。因此，我们在平时要肯下苦功夫，不断提升自身能力素质，积攒战胜困难的实力和底气，在困难来临时才能坦然面对、从容应对。 之所以“最不怕的就是困难”，是因为有攻坚克难的信心。前进道路上，免不了会遇到涉滩之险、爬坡之艰、闯关之难。人一旦缺少直面困难的信心，就很容易被困难击垮，难有作为。当我们身处逆境、遭遇困难时，只有具备压倒一切困难而不被困难所压倒的信心，以“不达目的不罢休”的执着，在挫折面前不气馁、在困难面前不屈服、在危难关头不退缩，始终风雨无阻向前进，才能克服重重困难，最终实现目标。 之所以“最不怕的就是困难”，是因为有经年累月的磨砺作根基。磨砺的过程往往遇到的矛盾多、困难大、风险高，我们只有不怕吃苦、勇于吃苦，才能承受得住千锤百炼，把自己锻造成打得了硬仗的利刃铁拳。无数事实表明，一个人经受的磨砺越多，距离成功就会越近。因而，我们应多到急难险重任务中锻炼自己，多在艰难困苦环境中磨砺自己，逐渐积累克服困难的宝贵经验。如此，在困难面前才能做到措置裕如，才能不怕困难、战胜困难。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230615000341/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16230817.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230613032444/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16230817.html,2023-06-15 0:00:00,"The more trials and tribulations a person undergoes, the closer he will be to success Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Li Yue Wang Zhuo Editor-in-Chief: Wang Yun 2023-06-13 07:04:12 0","""The most fearful thing is the difficulty"" ■ Li Yue Wang Zhuo ● own ability quality is excellent, in order to be able to deal with changes, even the biggest difficulties can be overcome. The more trials and tribulations a person undergoes, the closer he will be to success Not long ago, Wan Buyan, a professor at Hunan University of Science and Technology, was honored by the Central Propaganda Department with the title of ""Model of the Times"", and his advanced deeds were reported by the media, which aroused a warm reaction. One of the things is impressive: in 2021, the completion of the operation of the ""Manatee II"" was about to recover from the seabed accidentally ""jammed"", at this time a strong typhoon is approaching, if you can not solve the problem in a timely manner, you can only cut the umbilical cable, the cohesion of countless people's hard work made the rig discarded. If the problem could not be solved in time, we could only cut the umbilical cable and abandon the rig, which was made by countless people. In the face of such an urgent and difficult situation, Wan Buyan said to everyone: ""After so many years of fighting at sea, we are not afraid of difficulties!"" So, he led the team to find the problem and made a temporary system in a race against time, and successfully retrieved the rig intact two hours before the typhoon. Wan Buyan's spirit of ""fearing nothing more than difficulties"" is worth learning. The reason why he is not afraid of difficulties is because he has excellent ability. The quality of their own ability, in order to deal with changes, and then the big difficulties can be overcome. An exercise, Wuxi Joint Command and Security Center, a regiment in the delivery of media suddenly leaked, high-altitude repairmen wearing a full set of protective gear, slowly walking to the cliff hanging over and shaking more than the damaged point. In the case of the leakage point of the spray of fog flowers seriously impede the vision, repairmen nearly blind operation, only took more than 4 minutes to complete the plugging leakage and replacement of parts and other repair work. If there is no strong ability to quality, it is impossible to complete this task. Only the quality of ability, encounter difficulties can not panic, calmly find a solution. Therefore, we should be willing to work hard in the normal times, and constantly improve their own ability to accumulate the strength to overcome the difficulties of the strength and strength, in the difficulties to be able to face, calmly deal with. The reason why ""the most fearless is difficult"" is because of the confidence to overcome difficulties. On the road ahead, will inevitably encounter the risk of wading in the beach, climbing the difficult, difficult to break through the barrier. Once a person lacks the confidence to face up to difficulties, it is easy to be defeated by difficulties, difficult to do. When we are in adversity, encountered difficulties, only with all the difficulties and not be overpowered by the difficulties of confidence, ""do not stop until the goal is reached,"" the persistence of the frustration in the face of discouragement, in the face of difficulties do not give in, in the face of difficulties do not retreat, always wind and rain, always move forward, in order to overcome the difficulties, and ultimately to achieve the goal. The reason why ""the most fearless is difficult"", because there are years of sharpening as the foundation. Sharpening process often encountered more contradictions, difficulties, high risk, we are only not afraid to suffer, the courage to suffer, in order to withstand the hammer, forging themselves into a battle with the sharp edge of the iron fist. Countless facts show that the more a person undergoes trials and tribulations, the closer to success will be. Therefore, we should be more to the urgent and dangerous tasks in the exercise of their own, more in the difficult and difficult environment to sharpen their own, and gradually accumulate valuable experience in overcoming difficulties. In this way, in the face of difficulties can be well managed, can not be afraid of difficulties, to overcome the difficulties.","The article discusses the idea that facing and overcoming challenges, trials, and difficulties can lead to success. It highlighted an example of Wan Buyan, a professor at Hunan University of Science and Technology, who led a team to find and solve a problem with their ""Manatee II"" rig as it was recovering from the seabed. They faced a challenging situation with a strong typhoon approaching, but through their skills and confidence in tackling such difficulties, they were able to retrieve the rig and avoid discarding it, thus avoiding the loss of the efforts of thousands of people. The article urges people to improve their own abilities and be prepared to face and overcome challenges in order not to be afraid of difficulties."
以“功成不必在我”的境界创造“功成必定有我”的成绩 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：樊伟伟 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-13 06:50:15 0,涵养“功成不必在我”的境界 ■樊伟伟 ●努力跑好自己手中这一棒，跑出奋斗强军加速度，真正以“功成不必在我”的境界创造“功成必定有我”的成绩 在《习近平著作选读》第一卷《做焦裕禄式的县委书记》一文中，习主席明确强调：“要有‘功成不必在我’的境界，一张好的蓝图，只要是科学的、切合实际的、符合人民愿望的，就要像接力赛一样，一棒一棒接着干下去。”一个目标的实现、一项事业的发展，离不开一届届班子、一代代人的接续奋斗、攻坚克难。军队党员干部是奋斗强军的中坚力量、一流军队建设的中流砥柱，只有始终涵养“功成不必在我”的境界，矢志不渝地提升小我、追求大我，以一张蓝图绘到底、一锤接着一锤敲的定力推进工作，以抓必见效、干则必成的毅力狠抓落实，才能把新时代强军事业不断推向前进，交出经得起实践、人民、历史检验的合格答卷。 “功成不必在我”体现胸怀格局、彰显境界担当，检验着党员干部政治觉悟的高低、宗旨意识的强弱。习主席深刻指出，我们党除了国家、民族、人民的利益，没有任何自己的特殊利益。提到焦裕禄，人们都会感念他“拼上老命大干一场，决心改变兰考面貌”的执着；提到谷文昌，人们都会缅怀他“不治服风沙，就让风沙把我埋掉”的坚毅；提到张富清，人们都会崇敬他“哪里有困难，哪里条件艰苦，我就去哪里”的纯粹……党和国家事业之所以能够一程接着一程向前推进，离不开广大党员干部一棒接着一棒向前奔跑。对党员干部来说，看重什么、看轻什么，坚守什么、舍弃什么，是一个关乎得失观、名利观的大问题。只有始终看淡个人得失、看重事业发展，今天为明天打基础，这任为下任蓄后劲，才能以“忘我”付出实现“大我”追求，以个人之“失”换来事业之“得”。 “功成不必在我”承载的是铺路奠基、传棒接力的崇高使命。习主席强调：“一切伟大的成就都是接续奋斗、接力探索的结果，一切伟大的事业都需要在承前启后、继往开来中推进。”建设强大人民军队，是接续奋斗的伟大事业，一代人有一代人的崇高使命。生逢强国强军的伟大时代，我们既面临追梦圆梦的难得际遇，也肩负由跟跑并跑向领跑跨越的如山重任。越是任务艰巨、责任重大，越需要军队党员干部走在最前列、干在最难处，做到知责于心想干事、担责于身能干事、履责于行干成事。当前，最紧要的是聚焦实现建军一百年奋斗目标，把个人理想抱负融入强军实践，把智慧力量集聚到矢志强军的行动中，不断强化攻坚克难、务期必成的责任担当，在推进高水平备战、高效益建设、高质量发展上创实绩、建新功。 习主席指出，功成不必在我并不是消极、怠政、不作为，而是要牢固树立正确政绩观，既要做让老百姓看得见、摸得着、得实惠的实事，也要做为后人作铺垫、打基础、利长远的好事，既要做显功，也要做潜功。对军队党员干部而言，真干才能真出业绩、出真业绩，凡是有利于强军兴军的事情，就必须事不避难、义不逃责，大胆地干、坚决地干。“政如农功”，不可能一日见效、立竿见影。置身于奋斗强军的时代浪潮，我们应牢固树立和践行正确的政绩观，正确处理好稳和进、立和破、虚和实、标和本、近和远的关系，不贪一时之功、不图一时之名、不求一己之私，多奔事业少想自己，多担重任少些推诿，以实实在在的业绩赢得广大官兵的好口碑、历史沉淀之后的好评价。 “功成不必在我”的境界，是具体的、实践的、可知可感的，落到实际，就是要真抓实干、紧张快干、埋头苦干。习主席反复告诫我们：“干部就要有担当，有多大担当才能干多大事业，尽多大责任才会有多大成就。”迈向世界一流，并不是一片坦途，必须在披荆斩棘中开拓前进，在做好每一件工作、完成每一项任务、履行每一项职责中见精神。面对愈进愈难、愈进愈险的“新长征路”，军队党员干部尤须把强军的重担扛在肩上，把胜战的要求付诸实践，时刻保持“朝受命、夕饮冰，昼无为、夜难寐”的斗志，把真干作为本分，把实干作为责任，把苦干作为追求，把巧干作为方法，自觉加满油、把稳舵、鼓足劲，主动扛重活、打硬仗、经磨难，在应对风险挑战、克服矛盾困难、解决复杂问题的斗争中，勇做冲锋陷阵的“闯将”、攻城拔寨的“尖兵”、敢为人先的“头雁”，为了实现奋斗目标知重负重、知难克难、知险化险。 “功成不必在我”与“功成必定有我”是一体两面，“不必在我”讲求的是奉献忘我、功名无我、成就大我，“必定有我”指的是奋斗有我、实干有我、担当有我。习主席曾谆谆教诲广大干部要“有功成不必在我的精神境界、功成必定有我的历史担当，发扬钉钉子精神，脚踏实地干”。现在，强军的责任历史地落在了我们肩上，要挑起这副担子，我们更要以“功成不必在我”的胸襟谋划长远，以“功成必定有我”的担当干在当下，一心一意想强军、谋强军，一门心思钻打赢、练打赢，始终瞄着既定目标使长劲、紧盯强敌对手强本领、聚焦能打胜仗搞建设，做到遇“事”不躲敢担当，遇“难”不惧善作为，遇“责”不推显忠诚，遇“利”不惑守清廉，努力跑好自己手中这一棒，跑出奋斗强军加速度，真正以“功成不必在我”的境界创造“功成必定有我”的成绩。 （作者单位：海军政治工作部）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230615000341/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16230816.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230613032330/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16230816.html,2023-06-15 0:00:00,"With the realm of ""success does not have to be in me"" to create ""success must have me"" achievements Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Fan Weiwei Responsibility: Wang Yun 2023-06-13 06:50:15 0"," In the first volume of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, in the article ""Doing Jiao Yulu-style county party secretary"", President Xi clearly emphasized: ""We should have the realm of 'success does not have to be in me', and a good blueprint, as long as it is scientific, practical, and in line with the people's aspirations, should be implemented like a relay race, and then we should work together as a team. A good blueprint, as long as it is scientific, realistic and in line with the people's aspirations, should be carried on like a relay race, stick by stick."" The realization of a goal, the development of a cause, can not be separated from a session of the team, generations of successive struggles, overcome difficulties. Army party members and cadres are the backbone of the struggle for a strong army, the mainstay of the construction of a first-class army, only always cultivate the realm of ""success is not necessary for me"", unswervingly enhance the ego, the pursuit of the big I, a blueprint drawn to the end, a hammer knocking the hammer to push forward the work to grasp must be effective, dry will be the perseverance of the implementation of the implementation of the hard to be able to The new era of the strong military cause to move forward, handing over a qualified answer sheet that can withstand the test of practice, people and history. ""Success is not necessary in my"" embodies the pattern of mind, show the realm of responsibility, test the political awareness of party members and cadres, the strength of the sense of purpose. President Xi profoundly pointed out that, in addition to the interests of the country, the nation and the people, our party does not have any of its own special interests. Mention of Jiao Yulu, people will miss his ""desperate old life to do a big job, determined to change the face of Lankao,"" the persistence; mentioned Gu Wenchang, people will remember his ""do not subdue the wind and sand, let the wind and sand buried me"" perseverance; mentioned Zhang Fuqing, people will honor him! ""Where there are difficulties, where the conditions are difficult, I will go where the pure ...... Party and the country's cause can be a course after course forward, inseparable from the majority of Party members and cadres of the baton after baton forward running. For party members and cadres, what to value, what to despise, what to hold on to, what to give up, is a big problem related to the concept of gain and loss, the concept of fame and fortune. Only always look down on personal gains and losses, value career development, today for tomorrow to lay the foundation, this term for the next power savings, in order to ""forget me"" to pay to realize the ""big I"" pursuit, to personal ""lose ""In exchange for the cause of the"" gain "". ""Success does not have to be in me"" is carrying the noble mission of paving the way and passing the baton. President Xi emphasized: ""All great achievements are the result of successive struggles and successive exploration, and all great causes need to be carried forward in the past and the future, the past and the future."" Building a strong people's army is a great cause of successive struggles, and one generation has a noble mission. Born in the great era of strengthening the country and the army, we are faced with the rare opportunity to pursue our dreams and fulfill them, but also shoulder the mountainous responsibility of running parallel to the lead. The more arduous the task, the greater the responsibility, the more the army party members and cadres need to walk in the forefront, do in the most difficult place, do know the responsibility in the heart want to officer, take the responsibility in the body can officer, fulfill the responsibility in the line of doing things. At present, the most important thing is to focus on the realization of the army's 100-year goal, personal ideals and aspirations into the practice of the army, the wisdom and strength of the army gathered into the action of the will to strengthen the army, and constantly strengthen the difficulties, and the responsibility of the duty to be accomplished, and to promote the high level of preparedness for war, high efficiency construction, high-quality development, to create a new performance, to build new achievements. President Xi pointed out that success is not necessary in my not negative, slack, inaction, but to firmly establish a correct concept of performance, both to do so that the people can see, feel, get the benefits of the real thing, but also to do for future generations as a pavement, laying the foundation for the long term good things, not only to do the work, but also to do the work of the subconscious. For the army party members and cadres, really do to really out of performance, out of real performance, all things conducive to the development of a strong army, must not take refuge, righteousness, boldly do, resolutely do. ""Politics like farming"", it is impossible to see the effect in one day, instant results. In the struggle to strengthen the army wave of the times, we should firmly establish and practice the correct concept of performance, correctly deal with the stability and progress, establish and break, virtual and real, standard and this, near and far relationship, not greedy for a moment's success, do not want the name of the moment, do not seek their own selfishness, more to run for the cause of less think of their own, more to bear the burden of less shirking, in order to win the majority of the officers and soldiers with a solid performance of the good word of mouth, after the history of the precipitation of a good evaluation. ""Success does not have to be in my"" realm, is specific, practical, knowable and palpable, down to earth, is to really do, nervous and fast, head down and hard work. President Xi has repeatedly warned us: ""cadres should have to bear, how much bear to do much business, how much responsibility will have much achievement."" Toward world-class, is not a straight road, must be in the thorns and thorns in the pioneering forward, in every job, complete every task, fulfill every duty to see the spirit. In the face of more and more difficult, more and more dangerous ""new long march road"", the army party members and cadres in particular must put the burden of strengthening the army on their shoulders, put the requirements of winning the war into practice, and always keep the ""commanded to drink ice at night and day, daytime, nighttime, difficult to sleep,"" the fighting spirit, and really do as a job, and do as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility, and hard work as a responsibility. Do as a responsibility, do hard work as a pursuit, do skillfully as a method, consciously full of oil, steady rudder, drum enough energy, take the initiative to carry heavy work, fight hard battles, through the trials and tribulations, to deal with the risks and challenges, to overcome the contradictions and difficulties, to solve the complexity of the struggle, and to do the courage to charge into the battlefield of the ""generals"", to pull out the strongholds of the ""sharp soldiers"", the ""sharp soldiers"". The ""sharp soldiers"", dare to be the first ""wild goose"", in order to realize the goal of the struggle know the weight, know the difficulties to overcome the difficulties, know the dangers of the danger. ""Success does not have to be in me"" and ""success must have me"" is two sides of the same coin, ""do not have to be in me"" seeks to dedication and forgetfulness, fame, achievement, I. ""There must be me"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"", ""I"". ""There must be me"" refers to the struggle to have me, practical work have me, take charge of me. President Xi has taught the majority of cadres to ""have the spirit of success is not necessary in my realm, the success of the historical bearings, carry forward the spirit of nails, down-to-earth dry"". Now, the responsibility of strengthening the army has historically fallen on our shoulders, to take up this burden, we need to ""success does not have to be in my"" mindset to plan for the long term, ""success will certainly have my"" bear the responsibility to do in the present, single-mindedly want to strengthen the army, seek to strengthen the army, and mind drilling to win, practicing to win, and always be a good team player, and always be a good team player. Winning, practicing to win, always aiming at the established goals to make long energy, focusing on the strong enemy opponents strong skills, focusing on the ability to win the war to engage in construction, to do ""things"" do not hide dare to take responsibility, ""difficult"" not afraid of good as, ""responsibility"" not push show loyalty, ""not push"" to show loyalty, ""the success must be my"" play in the present. ""Do not push to show loyalty, when the"" profit ""not confused to keep clean, and strive to run well in their own hands this baton, run out of the struggle to strengthen the military acceleration, and truly ""success does not have to be in my"" realm to create ""success! I must have my"" achievements. (Author Unit: Navy Political Work Department)","The article highlights the importance of the mindset of ""success does not have to be in me,"" emphasizing that Party members and cadres must cultivate the realm of ""success is not necessary for me,"" unswervingly enhance their sense of purpose, and strive to realize the ""big I"" pursuit through the implementation of a good plan. They should work together as a team, craft a realistic blueprint, and effectively implement it, in order to achieve the goal and develop the cause.

Study of the Opinions on Advancing the Normalization and Institutionalization of Political Training ■ Long Feng President Xi, with a view to comprehensively strengthening the people's army's party building, to ensure that the barrel of the gun will always listen to the party's command, in the report of the twentieth CPC National Congress, explicitly proposed ""advancing the normalization and institutionalization of political training"". The report of the 20th CPC National Congress clearly proposed ""promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training"". Recently, the General Office of the Central Military Commission issued the Opinions on Promoting the Normalization and Institutionalization of Political Training (hereinafter referred to as the ""Opinions""), which clearly defines the overall requirements for deepening political training, the problem of targeting and systematic initiatives, and provides a basic guideline for the enhancement of the people's army's party leadership and party building in the new era. Fully understand the significance of promoting the regularization and institutionalization of political training Political training is the successful practice and important experience of the Party in building and mastering the army ideologically and politically, it is the Party's self-revolution in the practice of building and governing the army and the specific application and development of the Party's self-revolution in the practice of building and governing the army, and it is an important way to ensure that the Party members and cadres always maintain their advanced and pure nature. It is of great historical and practical significance to promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training in the new era. It is an important treasure to ensure that the people's army always listens to the Party's command. Emphasis on political training is the excellent tradition and political advantage of our Party and our army, and the history of our army's construction and development for more than 90 years is, in a certain sense, the history of ensuring the Party's absolute leadership of the army through political training. As early as 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong organized the Xinquan training, through political training and strong ideological and political work, so that the Red Army commanders in the ideological and political to achieve a high degree of unity, creating a precedent for the institutionalization of our army's political training, standardization. The resolution of the Gutian Conference established the fundamental principle of building the Party through ideology and the Army through politics, and became a programmatic document for the Party and the Army to carry out political work. The Yan'an Rectification during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the ""Three Investigations and Three Rectifications"" during the War of Liberation, the Rectification of the Party during the early years of the founding of New China, and the Rectification of the Party during the 1980s are all successful examples of the spirit of rectification that has been used to push forward political rectification and training. Through a series of political reorganization and training, the ideological awareness of the majority of officers and soldiers has been raised, and their ideology, organization and style of work have been purified to ensure that the army always listens to the Party, follows the Party, and effectively carries out its mission and tasks under the banner of the Party. The people's army in the new era to reorganize and start again the summary of experience. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee and President Xi have focused on building and mastering the army ideologically and politically, and insisted on promoting political reorganization and training in the spirit of rectification, achieving a series of landmark results. The decision to convene the Gutian All-Army Political Work Conference, focusing on strengthening the country and the army to carry out new political training, and leading the people's army to reorganize and set off again; successively carrying out the CPC's mass line education and practice activities, the ""Three Strictnesses and Three Truths"" thematic education, the ""Two Schools and One Doing"" learning and education, the ""Unforgettable Beginner's Mind"" learning and education, and ""The First Heart"" learning and education.  It has insisted on implementing the standards for good cadres in the military, and on correcting and purging discipline and anti-corruption, leading the entire military to find the roots of its problems, reforming and reforming the CPC, and pushing the Party's governance from loose and flimsy to strict and firm. Strict political discipline and political rules, serious political life within the party, comprehensive and thorough purging of Guo Boxiong, Xu Caihou, Fang Fenghui, Zhang Yang toxic influence, to promote the people's army political ecology has fundamentally changed for the better, and the new wind and positive spirit continue to rise. Practice shows that promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training is not only a scientific summary of the practical experience of the People's Army in adhering to the overall strict governance of the Party and the military since the 18th National Congress of the Party, but also a further deepening of the Party's understanding of the regularity of political training. The new journey is an important initiative to fully implement the strategy of political army building in the new era. At present, our country is in a critical stage of development from big to strong, and our army is striding forward on the journey to build a world-class army. The political building of the army has a bearing on the overall situation of the Party and the army, on the future of the people's army, and on the success or failure of the cause of strengthening the army. Political training is an important treasure for the people's army to strengthen itself politically, a powerful weapon to comprehensively strengthen the party leadership and party building of the army, and of great significance to the promotion and implementation of the strategy of building the army politically in the new era. On the new journey, there is a greater need to promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training, and to continuously consolidate the theoretical, practical and institutional achievements of political training since the 18th CPC National Congress; there is a greater need to continue to carry forward the spirit of rectification, and to persevere in correcting and purging discipline and anti-corruption, and to continue to stimulate a new wind of righteousness and maintain a high degree of unity and consolidation of the forces in a centralized and pure way; there is a greater need for a deeper appreciation of the decisive significance of the ""Two Establishments ""The decisive significance of the two established, strengthen the political bearing, firmly uphold the core, resolutely follow the command, better fulfill the mission and task of the new era entrusted by the Party and the people of our army. Accurately grasp the overall requirements of promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training Promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training, political, policy, pointing is very strong, must grasp the fundamental requirements, clear the fundamental purpose, and find the important grasp. Therefore, the Opinions emphasize that all levels should strengthen the sobriety and firmness of continuing to deepen political training, and make efforts to cast a firm character of loyalty, forge political capacity, purge the poisonous accumulation of evils, and invigorate the fighting state. Efforts to cast a firm character of loyalty. As the people's army under the leadership of the party, absolute loyalty is the political character of the people's army. To promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training, the fundamental thing is to ensure that the Party always firmly grasp the army ideologically, politically and organizationally, and to ensure that the people's army is absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable. Looking back on our military political training, always focus on adhering to and strengthening the Party's absolute leadership of the army, forging a loyal character. Only by educating and guiding the majority of officers and soldiers to arm their minds with advanced ideas and theories, and by strengthening political leadership to unify their minds, can we always gather the majority of officers and soldiers under the banner of the Party, and strengthen their political beliefs of being loyal to the Party and listening to the Party's command. Only by focusing on enhancing the political and organizational functions of Party organizations at all levels, and establishing and improving a strict management system that governs ideology, work, style and discipline, can we ensure that Party organizations at all levels will always be a strong battleground for realizing the absolute leadership of the Party over the military and uniting and leading the troops to accomplish various tasks. Only by adhering to the Party's management of cadres, the Party's management of talent, organization selection, and adhering to the political investigation and use of cadres can we ensure that the barrel of the gun will always be in the hands of reliable people who are loyal to the Party. Invest in forging political ability. In the work required to do a good job in a variety of capabilities, political ability is the first. With excellent political ability, in order to do consciously in the ideological and political action with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the CPC Central Committee to maintain a high degree of consistency. At the same time, we should also see that political ability is not innate, nor can it be practiced overnight. This requires that the promotion of the normalization and institutionalization of political training must focus on improving political capacity. Through the regularization of political ideological refinement, political ability training and political life experience, to help the majority of officers and soldiers to continuously improve political judgment, distinguish political right and wrong, grasp the political direction, maintain political sobriety, political position, and always maintain a high degree of political sensitivity and political discernment; to continuously improve political comprehension, and often and the Central Committee of the Party, the Central Military Commission and the President of the decision-making instructions to the standard, a deep understanding of the intentions of the higher level, understand the spirit of the instructions, and to understand the spirit of the instructions. The higher-ups intend to understand the spirit of the instructions, so as to be able to integrate and apply what they have learned; constantly improve the political implementation, consciously carry out the implementation of the Party's theories and routes and policies, and effectively do the Party Central Committee to advocate a resolute response to the Party Central Committee's decision to resolutely carry out the Party Central Committee's decision to resolutely refrain from the Party Central Committee's prohibited resolutely do not do. Efforts will be made to purge the poisonous accumulation of evils. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, our army started from the style of construction, comprehensive and thorough purging of the influence of poison, rectify the ideology, rectify the employment, rectify the organization, rectify the discipline, the people's army political ecology is new, the spirit of a new outlook, the army atmosphere is new. The ""four rectifications"" provide an important means of promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training. Through the consolidation of ideas, education and guidance of officers and soldiers with scientific theories to arm their minds and transform their thoughts, from the source of thought to dig up the roots and remove the evils, comprehensively and thoroughly remove ideological impurities, sweep away political dust; through the consolidation of personnel, to correct the selection and employment of personnel, to provide strong support for the cause of military personnel; through the consolidation of the organization, to enhance the political function of the party organizations at all levels and organizational functions, and to enhance the awareness of the party consciousness of all members of the party, party awareness; through the consolidation of discipline, to strictly enforce the political ecology, the spirit of a new spirit, a new spirit, a new atmosphere, a new spirit. Rectification of discipline, strict political discipline and political rules, to help the majority of officers and soldiers to further enhance the sense of discipline and awareness of rules. Only in this way can the ideological, organizational, and style of work completely purged from the poisonous accumulation of evils, to ensure that the people's army never deteriorate, never change color, never change taste. Efforts to improve the state of vibration. Today, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation into an irreversible historical process, we ushered in an incomparably bright prospects, at the same time, we are also in the more difficult, more dangerous and not into the retreat, must enter the juncture. At this critical juncture, we need to vigorously carry forward the spirit of struggle, and continue to raise the state of excitement. To promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training is to continuously stimulate the majority of officers and soldiers, especially the leadership at all levels of cadres, the enthusiasm and initiative of creativity, all thoughts and energy focused on the preparation for war, the main responsibility of the main business, take the initiative to play as the initiative, the intention to reform and innovation in the face of the big right and wrong dare to sword, in the contradiction in front of the problem dare to face up to the difficulties in front of the crisis and difficulties in front of the dare to stand up to the crooked and evil. Dare to fight resolutely in front of, with the persistence of biting the green mountain not letting go, the more difficult and dangerous the more courage to move forward, do not achieve the goal will not give up determination, towards the realization of the military one hundred years of struggle on schedule. Continuously enhance the action consciousness of promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training Promoting the normalization and institutionalization of political training is a basic, recurrent and long-term work, which requires both a good battle and a long-lasting battle. It must be integrated into the daily routine and grasped on a regular basis, so that it can be carried out on a regular basis, institutionalized and implemented in a long-term manner. Consistently strengthen the theoretical armament. Political firmness comes from theoretical sobriety. Promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training, we must adhere to the Party's innovative theories to unify thought, will and action. At present, the first and foremost fundamental is to learn and understand Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, highlighting Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, guiding officers and soldiers to deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", and constantly enhancing the ""four consciousnesses"", firming the ""four self-confidence"", and ""four confidence"". The ""four self-confidence"" and ""two safeguards"" are constantly being strengthened, and the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission is being implemented to provide a strong political guarantee for the timely realization of the goal of building the army for 100 years. To carry out a solid ""study the idea of a strong army, build a strong army cause"" education and practice activities, strengthen the party history and military history learning and education, inherit the red genes, continue the red bloodline. We must adhere to the unity of rectification and political training, not only to check and correct superficial problems, but also to change the deep-rooted problems. To adhere to the learning style of theory and practice, in the learning of thinking and using through, know the unity of faith and action in the firm ideals and beliefs, molding loyalty character. Consistently refining party spirit. Party spirit is the cornerstone of party cadres, career, speech and morality. A party member's party nature, will not increase with the party age and position and naturally improve, must constantly strengthen the cultivation and refinement. The process of refining party spirit is the process of purifying the mind and soul. To educate officers and soldiers always with the Party, always do the Party's principles first, the Party's cause first, the people's interests first, adhere to the test of right and wrong, in the fight against unhealthy winds, in dealing with all kinds of complex contradictions and thorny issues in the refining of the Party, the sincere love of the Party, the Party is always worried about the Party, firm protection of the Party, and the Party's full strength to the implementation of the work of all aspects.

To strengthen discipline inspection and supervision, inspection and inspection, audit supervision, judicial supervision, with rigid initiatives to promote the continued deepening of political rectification. The system optimizes the policy and institutional mechanisms. The Opinion requires that system construction be carried out throughout, and that the implementation of the system be promoted by constant control and long term governance, and that the norms of the system be regulated to ensure normal and long-lasting effect.

To achieve the goal of building the army for one hundred years on schedule, and to accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army, slow development is not possible, and low quality is not possible, we must implement the new development concept, take the road of high-quality development, and promote the high-quality development of national defense and army construction with a high level of military governance. With a high level of governance to strengthen the system advantage of listening to the party command The high quality development of national defense and army construction is under the absolute leadership of the party to the army, along the direction of the strong military goal guide development. Adhering to the Party's absolute leadership of the army is an important political advantage of the Party and the country, and is the foundation and soul of the people's army. The people's army's resolute obedience to the Party's command is a fundamental legal treasure that ensures the Party's long-term rule and the country's long-term stability. To ensure the high-quality development of national defense and military construction, the core is to adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, to take the strong military objectives as the unifying leader, to make decisions and grasp the construction closely around the strong military objectives, and to use the strong military objectives to examine, lead, and promote high-quality development. At present, the international strategic situation and national security environment has undergone profound changes, the struggle in the field of ideology is acute and complex, and the task of reform, development and stabilization is arduous and burdensome. The more complex the struggle and the heavier the task, the more important it is to consolidate and develop the fundamental principle and system of the absolute leadership of the Party over the military, to ensure that the construction and utilization of military forces can better cope with the risks and challenges ahead, and to effectively carry out the mission and tasks of the military. This requires that we must comprehensively strengthen military governance, with a high level of governance, to cast the absolute leadership of the Party over the army as the soul of a strong army, and to strengthen the institutional advantages of the people's army to listen to the Party's command. The first is to comprehensively and thoroughly implement the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission, strictly implement the system and mechanisms of the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission, and ensure that all actions are under the command of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi; the second is to comprehensively implement the requirements for building a political army, improve the institutional system for the construction of the People's Army's Party, and perfect the organizational system of the Party's leadership of the army, and ensure that the barrel of the gun will always be under the command of the Party; and the third is to ensure that the Party's absolute leadership of the army as a point of reference. The third is to improve the system of policies and systems for the application of military forces, the system of policies and systems for the construction of military forces, and the system of policies and systems for military management, so as to ensure that the absolute leadership of the Party over the army is put into practice with a more scientific and perfect system, and to implement the principle of the Party commanding the gun into the entire process of national defense and army construction in all fields. Accelerating the effective supply of advanced combat power with high-level governance Advanced combat power refers to the combat power that is compatible with information-based intelligent warfare, and is dominated by the new domain and new quality combat power. At present, artificial intelligence technology is developing in an explosive manner and is being rapidly applied in the military field, and the form of war is accelerating the evolution of informationization and intelligence, so the high-quality development of national defense and military construction must be directed by the effective supply of advanced combat power. The generation of advanced combat power is a systematic project involving various fields and aspects of national defense and military construction, with numerous elements, multi-dimensional space, multiple forces, complex structure, high technical requirements, long construction cycle, many input resources, and big risks and challenges, there is an urgent need to apply the concept and method of governance, and make efforts to crack the outstanding contradictions and problems restricting the generation of combat power to improve the quality and efficiency of the supply of advanced combat power. First, to strengthen the system integration of the elements of combat power generation. Focusing on combat doctrine, organization and system, personnel, weapons and equipment, and other elements of systematic integration of combat power generation, coupling linkage, to accelerate the effective supply of combat power with systematic governance. The second is to make up for the weak links in the generation of combat power. Focus on the existence of shortcomings and weaknesses, the collection of wisdom and efforts to breakthroughs, the shortcomings and weaknesses of the pull up to make up for the new growth point of combat effectiveness. Third, highlight the new domain of new quality combat force construction. The construction of new combat forces in new areas and new qualities urgently requires the use of governance concepts and methods to promote forward-looking layout, strengthen overall coordination, scientific planning, precise control of progress, to ensure that the development of related forces in an orderly manner, scientific integration into the joint combat system. High-level governance to promote the systematic development of military construction The information war is a systematic war, which puts forward rigid requirements for planning and promoting the construction of military forces in a systematic manner. The high-quality development of national defense and military construction is a development with systematization as the main symbol, emphasizing systematic overall design and engineering system integration to achieve optimal overall function. The outstanding contradictions and problems in system construction, especially in combat system construction, are bottlenecks that affect the quality of national defense and military construction. This requires us to apply the concepts and methods of military governance, strengthen overall coordination, systematic construction and systemic governance, and promote the systematic development of military construction. Firstly, we should use high-level top-level design to lead the governance of major issues. The top-level design is to take into account all elements, all levels and all fields, trace the root causes, take a holistic view, and seek solutions to problems at the highest level. To comprehensively strengthen military governance, it is necessary to further improve the top-level design of the institutional mechanism, institutional norms, operational processes, and effectively enhance the scientific, global and authoritative nature of the top-level design. Secondly, high-quality integrated planning should be used to solve cross-border governance problems. To comprehensively strengthen military governance, we must focus on the major tasks of systematic combat capability building, focus on improving the mechanism for linking military needs and projects, continuously optimize the content, mode, mechanism, and process of war construction and preparedness coordination, cross-domain coordination, and military-to-military coordination, and accelerate the establishment of a matrix-type organizational system and operational mechanism that is organically coupled with the forces of all parties in a war-led construction, domain synergy, and military-to-military coordination, so that we can achieve scientific planning and strong coordination. Thirdly, we will use scientific consulting and assessment to support the project. Third, the scientific consulting and assessment support system governance decision-making. Comprehensively strengthen military governance, we must further standardize the decision-making mechanism of major projects, major projects, build a strong professional consulting and assessment institutions, establish a scientific system of operation and norms, to provide a strong guarantee for the national defense and military construction of major decisions. High-level governance to promote self-reliance in national defense science and technology Science and technology is the core fighting force, and scientific and technological innovation is the most revolutionary key force in the development of the army, and the first driving force to lead the development. The high-quality development of national defense and military construction is the development of science and technology innovation as a powerful driving engine. It is necessary to comprehensively enhance the level of governance of national defense science and technology innovation, give full play to the role of science and technology as a strategic support for the high-quality development of national defense and military construction, accelerate the strategic layout of forward-looking areas concerning long-term development, achieve a high level of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-reliance, and constantly improve the rate of scientific and technological innovation on the contribution of high-quality development of national defense and military construction. First, comprehensively strengthen the strategic planning of national defense science and technology development. Comprehensively understand the overall situation of China's science and technology innovation, incorporate national defense science and technology innovation into the overall strategic layout of national science and technology innovation, and comprehensively plan in the strategic layout of national science and technology self-reliance and self-improvement. Second, further improve the national defense science and technology innovation system and policy system. Following closely the process of building a strong scientific and technological country, we will accelerate the pace of reform of the institutional mechanism and policy system of national defense science and technology innovation, strengthen the innovation of the institutional mechanism of national defense science and technology development strategy, planning and planning, weapon and equipment research and development and production, and optimize the layout of national defense science and technology innovation, so as to continuously improve the capability and level of national defense science and technology innovation. Thirdly, we will make great efforts to grasp the independent innovation of core and key technologies. Aiming at the world's scientific and technological development frontiers, play a good first move, fight the battle of initiative, focus on the frontier, forward-looking design, firmly grasp the initiative. Choose the main direction of independent innovation and breakthroughs, strengthen advance research and exploration, and strive to occupy a place in forward-looking, strategic areas. High-level governance stimulates the motivation and vitality of the vast number of officers and soldiers The vast number of officers and soldiers is the main body of national defense and military construction. The high-quality development of national defense and army construction is a development in which the honor of the military profession is more apparent, the value needs of the majority of officers and soldiers are better reflected, the spirit of creativity is effectively stimulated, and the growth and progress of officers and soldiers is unified with the overall development of the army. This requires us to respect the main position of the officers and soldiers, play the role of the main body of governance of the officers and soldiers, with a high level of governance to stimulate the officers and soldiers to participate in military governance of the initiative and creativity. First, focus on playing the spirit of initiative of officers and soldiers in military governance. Focus on the officers and soldiers to hand over the task, pressure, ladder, decentralization and empowerment, to enhance the officers and soldiers sense of identity, sense of belonging, to inspire the officers and soldiers combined with their own practice, bold breakthroughs, the courage to innovate, and in a timely manner, the effective practice of solidified into a system of norms. Whether the majority of officers and soldiers are satisfied, as a measure of the effectiveness of the implementation of the system and the effectiveness of military governance is an important criterion. Secondly, to increase the soldiers and officers of the urgent problem of governance. Comprehensively strengthen the military governance, must always aim at the officers and soldiers of the urgent problems do the work, the officers and soldiers where the urgent, difficult, worry where, hope where, where the focus of the governance, increase the complexity of the governance, and effectively strengthen the officers and soldiers satisfaction and sense of achievement, with passionate concern for the care of the officers and soldiers of the powerful initiatives, to create a good environment for the heart to stay in the people. Third, the mechanism of innovation to motivate officers and soldiers to play as. Further optimize and improve the mechanism to motivate officers and soldiers to play as, not only clear how to tolerate and correct mistakes, but also clear how to motivate to play as, to give a bigger stage to the active officers and entrepreneurs, to guide the officers and soldiers to play as, take the initiative to play as, innovation, in the great practice of strengthening the army and the army to glow with vigor and vitality, so that all the wisdom conducive to the construction of the army to the full flow of the army to win the war of the vitality of the army to compete!

In the opening chapter of the first volume of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, ""Holding High the Great Banner of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and Striving in Unity for the Comprehensive Construction of a Modernized Socialist Country,"" President Xi earnestly admonished the whole Party: ""Adhere to the unity of learning, thinking, and application, and the unity of knowledge, belief, and action, so as to turn the thought of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era into the powerful force that strengthens the ideals, refines the Party's character, and guides the practice and promotes work."" This important exposition fully embodies the Marxist style of linking theory to practice, pointing out the direction and providing a guideline for the whole party to strengthen theoretical armament. In the whole party to carry out in-depth study and implementation of Xi Jinping socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era of the theme of education, is to implement the spirit of the twentieth party's major initiatives, is the new era of the new journey to create a new situation for the development of the party's cause of the fundamental requirements, can make us with the party's innovative theory of the latest achievements of the unity of thought, unity of will, unity of action, and further formation of strong cohesion, combat force. In the theme of education, to achieve a comprehensive study and understanding, comprehensive and systematic mastery of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era and transform it into a strong force to strengthen the ideals, refine party spirit and guide practice and promote work, party members and cadres should adhere to the learning of thought and use of coherent, unity of knowledge and beliefs and actions, really learn the Marxist watchword, and constantly improve political ability and performance of their duties, and thus work hard to have a new workplace. We will strive to make new achievements in our workplaces so as to build a modernized socialist country and promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in an all-round way. The more you learn, the more you know. Our party has always attached importance to theoretical learning, the Party Central Committee led the Red Army arrived in Yan'an in October 1935, the end of the year on the formation of the Central Party School, even in the most difficult time, the Party Central Committee is still determined to cadres centralized learning rectification, in the whole party set off a study contest boom. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has repeatedly talked about the importance of strengthening theoretical learning for party members and cadres, emphasizing the need to ""truly learn the skills of Marxism"" and calling on the whole party to learn and master the powerful ideological weapons of understanding the world and transforming the world. With regard to theoretical study, Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, should carry forward the Party's fine tradition, implement President Xi's instructions, adhere to the requirements of one step ahead of the others, study at a deeper level, and effectively study the authoritative teaching materials for thematic education, such as Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, in their original flavors, article by article and sentence by sentence, so as to comprehensively and systematically grasp the basic connotations and scientific system of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and to understand the concepts proposed therein. The new ideas, new thoughts and new strategies put forward in it, as well as the specific requirements in various aspects, should be recognized and viewed in the whole scientific system, so as to know more about the meaning of the words, and more about the reasons; accurately understanding and grasping the worldview and methodology of this important thought, learning the position and viewpoints and methods running through it, and comprehending the rationale and philosophy embedded in it, so as to guarantee a firm position with theoretical clarity, and solve problems with the great power of the truth. In order to solve problems, guide practice and promote work with the great power of the truth, we need to understand the worldview and methodology of this important idea. Thinking is the key to learning and deepening, the letter is the inner self-consciousness and identity, thinking about the depth of the decision to the extent of the letter. President Xi pointed out that ""we should educate and guide the majority of Party members and cadres to undergo ideological refinement and spiritual baptism, and firmly believe in Marxism, socialism with Chinese characteristics, and confidence in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"", which means that we are required to realize ""thinking"" and ""thinking"" through ""learning"" and ""thinking"". This means that we are required to realize ""thinking and believing"" through ""learning and thinking"", and to effectively build the foundation of faith, replenish the calcium of the spirit, and stabilize the rudder of thought. This is always a powerful spiritual force to guide and support us to overcome all difficulties and obstacles.

Looking back on our party's struggle, insisting on arming the whole party with the latest achievements of the Chineseization of Marxism, guiding practice and promoting work is an important experience for our party to always stand invincible and constantly create brilliant undertakings. President Xi pointed out that we should consciously practice the socialist thought with Chinese characteristics for the new era, use it to transform the objective world and promote career development, use it to observe the times, grasp the times and lead the times, actively recognize changes and seek changes, solve various contradictions and problems in economic and social development and Party construction, prevent and resolve major risks, and promote new progress and breakthroughs in Chinese-style modernization. Only by vigorously carrying forward the Marxist style of learning, to do physically, learning to use, with some gain, can really implement the results of learning to do a good job in their own work. In the face of achieving the goal of building the army for one hundred years and accelerating the people's army to build a world-class army, the majority of party members and cadres must be a strong political consciousness, put themselves in, put their duties in, put their work in, and always do the first to learn first to use, to use to promote the line, demonstration and drive, and strive to learn to transform the power of the risk prevention, to solve the problem, and the development of the power of the practice; to be a strong political commitment, carry forward the spirit of struggle, enhance the ability to struggle, and to improve the ability to do the work, so that we can really implement the results of learning to do a good job on the.

思想战线丨以辩证方法加强党内团结 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：任 龙 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-21 07:11:16 0,以辩证方法加强党内团结 ■任 龙 旗帜鲜明讲政治、确保党的团结和集中统一是党的生命，也是我们党能成为百年大党、创造世纪伟业的关键所在。1957年，毛泽东同志在莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议上作了重要发言，《党内团结的辩证方法》就是发言的一部分，其中提出对党内团结要采取辩证的方法。历史和实践证明，党面临的形势越复杂、任务越艰巨，就越要保持党的团结统一。新时代新征程，我们正处在全面建设社会主义现代化国家、向第二个百年奋斗目标进军的关键时刻，要完成使命任务，就必须始终确保党的团结统一。因此，采取辩证方法加强党内团结，对于我们党而言依然十分必要。 采取辩证方法科学把握团结的对象。对立统一规律是辩证法的核心。我们以辩证方法加强党内团结，首先就要充分认识到无产阶级政党的发展和巩固是通过内部的斗争来实现的，党的团结也是经过斗争而取得的。在毛泽东同志看来，对团结的对象，应该一分为二地看待，“只要不是敌对分子，破坏分子，那就要采取团结的态度。对他们要采取辩证的方法，而不应采取形而上学的方法”。对于“团结谁”的问题，毫无疑问，我们应团结大多数，甚至尽可能地团结最大多数。在这个问题上，要坚决防止把团结变成“结团”，搞党同伐异，只讲人情而不讲原则，只看亲疏而不论是非。“结团”实质上是搞小圈子，邓小平同志指出：“小圈子那个东西害死人呐！很多失误就从那里出来，错误就从这里犯起。”必须严守政治纪律和政治规矩，坚持五湖四海，团结一切忠诚于党的同志，团结大多数，不得以人划线，不得搞任何形式的派别活动；决不能搞封建依附那一套，决不能搞小山头、小圈子、小团伙那一套。 采取辩证方法正确对待犯错误的同志。唯物辩证法认为，客观事物总是处在运动、变化和发展的过程中，矛盾的双方在一定条件下会朝着各自相反的方向转化。对待犯错误的同志，究竟是帮助他改正错误，还是把人“一棍子打死”，这是党内团结的一个重要原则性问题。我们以辩证方法加强党内团结，就是“对一切加以分析，承认人总是要犯错误的，不因为一个人犯了错误就否定他的一切”。毛泽东同志指出：“对犯错误的同志第一是要斗争，要把错误思想彻底肃清。第二，还要帮助他。一曰斗，二曰帮。从善意出发帮助他改正错误，使他有一条出路。”所谓“斗”，就是对犯错误的同志开展积极的思想斗争，帮助他们把错误思想彻底肃清；所谓“帮”，就是帮助他们分清是非、改正错误，在斗争基础上达到新的团结。这种解决党内矛盾的方法，就是对唯物辩证法的具体运用。假若对犯错误同志的错误思想不开展积极的思想斗争，甚至姑息迁就、回避矛盾，那就不是帮助同志而是害了同志，不是加强党内团结而是影响了党内团结。但是，如果没有团结的愿望、治病救人的目的，一味强调斗争，把人“一棍子打死”，同样不利于加强党的团结。因此，对犯错误的同志，就要“一只手跟他作斗争，一只手跟他讲团结”。 采取辩证方法积极解决党内思想斗争。党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会矛盾和新旧事物矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。这告诉我们，党的团结和集中统一不是表面上的一团和气，而是基于共同理想、组织原则和纪律约束的更高层次的团结统一。延安时期，我们党开展整风运动，目的之一就是解决党的内部矛盾，经过批评和斗争，承认错误，分清是非，在斗争基础上实现新的团结。恩格斯说：“团结并不排斥相互间的批评。没有这种批评就不可能达到团结。没有批评就不能互相了解，因而也就谈不到团结。”我们应科学看待党内出现的思想斗争，抱着既要弄清思想又要团结同志的态度去积极解决，在党内同志之间出现意见分歧时，应鼓励大家畅所欲言，充分发表自己的意见。同时，用好批评和自我批评这个锐利思想武器，贯彻“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，既敢于批评、有讲真话的勇气，又善于批评、有让人听得进真话的方法，进一步浓厚党内政治生活的政治性、时代性、原则性、战斗性、在红脸出汗中实现“更高层次的团结”。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230623225723/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16232570.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230628083515/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16232570.html,2023-06-24 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨Strengthening Intra-Party Unity by Dialectical Methods Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Ren Long Editor-in-Chief：Wang Yun 2023-06-21 07:11:16 0,"Strengthening Intra-Party Unity by Dialectical Methods ■Ren Long Flagging politics and ensuring party unity and centralization are the life of the party, and the key to our party's becoming a century-old party and creating a century's greatness.In 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong made an important speech at a meeting of representatives of the Communist Party and Workers' Party in Moscow, and the ""Dialectical Methods of Intra-Party Unity"" was a part of the speech, which suggested that a dialectical method of internal unity of the party should be adopted. dialectical approach. History and practice have proved that the more complex the situation and the more arduous the task facing the Party, the more important it is to maintain Party unity. In the new era and new journey, we are at the critical moment of building a modern socialist country in all aspects and marching towards the second hundred-year goal, and we must always ensure the unity of the Party if we want to accomplish our mission and tasks. Therefore, adopting a dialectical approach to strengthen the unity of the Party is still very necessary for our Party. Adopt a dialectical approach to scientifically grasp the object of unity. The law of unity of opposites is the core of dialectics. To strengthen intra-Party unity through a dialectical approach, we must first fully realize that the development and consolidation of the proletarian party is realized through internal struggle, and that Party unity is also achieved through struggle. In Comrade Mao Zedong's view, the objects of unity should be viewed in two ways: ""As long as they are not hostile or destructive elements, then an attitude of unity should be adopted. A dialectical approach, not a metaphysical one, should be adopted towards them"". On the question of ""whom to unite"", there is no doubt that we should unite with the majority, or even the largest possible majority. On this issue, we must resolutely prevent turning solidarity into ""grouping together"", engaging in ""party consensus"", speaking only in terms of favors rather than principles, and looking only at affinity rather than right and wrong. ""Group"" is essentially a small circle, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: ""small circle that thing kills people! Many blunders come out from there, and mistakes are made from here."" Must strictly abide by political discipline and political rules, adhere to the five lakes, unite all comrades loyal to the party, unite the majority, not to draw a line in the sand, not to engage in any form of factional activities; must not engage in feudal dependence that set, must not engage in a small mountain, small circles, small gangs that set. Adopt a dialectical approach to correctly treat comrades who have made mistakes. Material dialectics that objective things are always in motion, change and development process, the two sides of the contradiction under certain conditions will be transformed in the opposite direction. Treatment of comrades who have made mistakes, is to help him correct his mistakes, or to ""beat people to death"", which is an important principle of unity within the party. To strengthen the Party's internal unity through a dialectical approach is to ""analyze everything, recognize that people always make mistakes, and not to deny everything about a person just because he or she has made a mistake"". Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: ""The first thing to do with a comrade who has made a mistake is to fight him, to purge him of his wrong ideas. Secondly, we must help him. The first is to fight, the second is to help. From goodwill to help him correct his mistakes, so that he has a way out."" The so-called ""fight"" is to carry out a positive ideological struggle against comrades who have made mistakes, and to help them purge their wrong ideas completely; the so-called ""help"" is to help them distinguish right from wrong and correct their mistakes, so as to achieve a new unity on the basis of the struggle. This method of resolving internal contradictions within the Party is a concrete application of materialistic dialectics. If we do not carry out a positive ideological struggle against the erroneous thoughts of comrades who have committed mistakes, or even condone them and avoid conflicts, we will not be helping comrades but harming them, and we will not be strengthening the unity of the Party but affecting it. However, if there is no desire for unity, the purpose of curing the sick and saving the sick, and emphasize the struggle, and ""beat people to death"", it is also not conducive to strengthening the unity of the Party. Therefore, for comrades who have made mistakes, we should ""fight with them with one hand and unite with them with the other"". Adopting a dialectical approach to positively resolve the ideological struggle within the Party. The opposition and struggle of different ideas within the Party is a frequent occurrence, which is a reflection of social contradictions and contradictions between old and new things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the Party, the life of the Party will cease. This tells us that the unity and centralized unity of the Party is not a superficial harmony, but a higher level of unity and solidarity based on common ideals, organizational principles and disciplinary constraints. During the Yan'an period, one of the aims of the Party's rectification campaign was to resolve the Party's internal contradictions, to recognize mistakes and distinguish between right and wrong after criticism and struggle, and to achieve new unity on the basis of the struggle. Engels said, ""Unity does not exclude mutual criticism. Without such criticism it is impossible to achieve unity. Without criticism it is impossible to understand each other, and therefore there can be no talk of unity."" We should look at the ideological struggle within the Party scientifically, hold the attitude of both clarifying the ideas and uniting the comrades to solve the problem positively, and encourage everyone to speak freely and fully express their own opinions when there are differences of opinion among comrades within the Party. At the same time, good use of criticism and self-criticism as a sharp ideological weapon, the implementation of the policy of ""to punish before to prevent, to cure the disease to save the patient"", not only dare to criticize, have the courage to tell the truth, but also good at criticizing, have the method of letting people listen to the truth, and to further thicken the political, contemporary, principled, fighting within the political life of the Party, and to realize the ""higher level of unity"" in the face of the red and sweat. ""A higher level of unity"". (Author's unit: National Defense University School of Political Science)","The article discusses the importance of maintaining party unity and centralization for the ruling Communist Party of China. It highlights the significance of adopting a dialectical approach to strengthen intra-party unity, citing the historical and practical experience of the party in various situations. The dialectical approach emphasizes the unity of opposites, which includes treating potential enemies with unity and understanding, strictly abiding by political discipline and political rules, and correctly handling comrades who have made mistakes by both fighting and helping them.

Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing that intra-party contradictions and struggles are inevitable and should be actively resolved through criticism and self-criticism, encouraging open discussions and the use of the policy of punishment before prevention, to cure the sick, and to save the patient.

The approach aims to achieve a higher level of unity and solidarity based on shared ideals, organizational principles, and disciplinary constraints. Despite its focus on party unity, the article also acknowledges the importance of autonomy and freedom of speech within the party.

In summary, the article emphasizes the importance of a dialectical approach to strengthening party unity, highlighting the need to treat potential enemies with unity and understanding, strictly following political discipline and rules, handling comrades with mistakes correctly, actively resolving intra-party conflicts, and promoting a higher level of unity within the party."

On December 4, 2012, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee considered and passed the report on Improve work style, close contact with the masses of the eight provisions. Today, the eight provisions have become synonymous with the construction of our party's style of work, and have become the ""first action"" to reshape our party's image. Style of work is related to the back and forth of people's hearts, and the survival of the Party. President Xi once said: ""The problem of work style is absolutely not trivial, if you do not resolutely correct the bad style, let it develop, it will be like an invisible wall separating the party and the people, our party will lose the foundation, lose blood, lose strength."" Only strict work style, resolutely opposed to learning and use of the disconnect, the theme of education and to promote the implementation of the central work, such as combining, integrated arrangements, reasonable arrangement of measures and tasks, in order to achieve the objectives and tasks, to achieve the desired results. Once upon a time, the People's Army, the mighty force of the courage and majesty, the blood of the will to diminish, the red traditions and fine style of work in a few people gradually faded. After the introduction of the eight provisions of the Central Committee, President Xi and the Central Military Commission the first time to formulate the ten provisions of the Military Commission, the People's Army resolutely to the bad style to say ""no"", a point by point to grasp, a standard a standard to cure, a wind a wind to correct, adhere to grasp the style of work and grasp the combat effectiveness of the same force, set up a new style and set up the standard of combat effectiveness together to promote, and constantly The style of construction to deepen. Good style, highlighting a ""real"" word, focusing on a ""true"" word. In reality, individual party members and cadres in the work style there are still some problems, such as the sense of purpose and the mass point of view of the tree is not firm, investigation and research is not often, not in-depth, the grass-roots officers and soldiers do not understand the urgency of the difficulties and sorrows of the hope that the solution is not deep, not strong, the rectification and cure of formalism, bureaucracy and the ""more than five"" problem is not thorough, the existence of privileged thinking and privileged behavior, and so on. And so on. These bad style can not be rooted out, the real work, real fight real preparation of the distinctive orientation can not be set up, with one heart and one mind, unity to win the emotional ties can not be linked, service centers, to protect the winning resource investment can not be focused. The style problem is stubborn and recurring, grasp style construction can not slacken for a moment. Undesirable style tree fell root is still in, new invisible mutation problems occur from time to time, rebound and pressure is still in the hidden danger. Only by effectively doing so can we avoid ""a grasp on the improvement, a loose on the rebound"". This requires party organizations at all levels in the theme of education in the tree firmly problem-oriented, and effectively find out what problems are caused by the lack of ideological awareness, which problems are caused by the lack of implementation of the work responsibility, do not trivialize the delay, do not ""mean"", do not engage in ""the next one is not an exception"", really! To do in often and long, strict and real, deep and fine on the effort, see the effect. For communists, the most dangerous faltering of ideals and beliefs is the faltering of ideals and beliefs. Behind the style of inaccuracy, often associated with the loss of ideals and beliefs of the ""star"". Party organizations at all levels in the theme of education should adhere to the Xi Jinping new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics to concentrate the soul, highlighting Xi Jinping's strong military thinking armed, vigorously strengthen the ideals and beliefs of education, awareness of the purpose of education, ideological and moral education, guiding party members and cadres from the ideological source, solid foundation, set up a correct view of performance, the concept of power and the concept of career, tamping down the foundation of the beliefs, replenishment of the spirit of the calcium, the rudder to stabilize the idea. ""If the law is not strict, it will not be established, and if the rule is not strict, it will not be gained."" The system is fundamental, global, stable and long-term. All levels of the military should be for the style of construction of new situations and new problems, and constantly improve the design of the system, in the standard on the delineation of the hard bar, in the implementation of the establishment of a high-pressure line, adhere to the no-go area, full coverage, zero tolerance, adhere to the heavy deterrent, strong high-pressure, long deterrent, really make the system become a hard constraint, iron rules. Good style of troops is the leadership out. Leadership in the construction of the style of troops is in a dominant position, often a leader's work style, is the work style of the troops. To carry out the theme of education and learning, party organs and leading cadres at all levels should take the lead to improve the work style and guidance, sink to the grassroots line, put down the shelf in-depth life of the officers and soldiers, ""zero distance"" close to the officers and soldiers, ""zero obstacles"" to listen to the voices, ""zero distortion"", ""zero"", ""zero"". ""Zero distortion"" to grasp the real situation, adhere to the combination of eating through the top and find out the bottom, personal efforts and play the role of the masses, to provide a strong style of guarantee for the strong army.",The article discusses the importance of improving work style and emphasizes the need to eliminate bad habits in order to strengthen the army. It highlights President Xi Jinping's strong military thinking and ideological beliefs as the key factor in reshaping the party's image.

思想战线丨深刻认识建设教育强国的重大战略意义 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：孙庆聚 责任编辑：王韵 2023-06-21 06:46:35 0,深刻认识建设教育强国的重大战略意义 ■孙庆聚 教育是立国之本、强国之基。国家要强盛、民族要振兴，基础在教育，关键靠教育。习近平总书记在中共中央政治局第五次集体学习时强调：“建设教育强国，是全面建成社会主义现代化强国的战略先导，是实现高水平科技自立自强的重要支撑，是促进全体人民共同富裕的有效途径，是以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的基础工程。”我们要站在实现中华民族伟大复兴的战略全局高度，深刻认识建设教育强国的重大战略意义，加快建设高质量教育体系，大力推进教育现代化。 全面建成社会主义现代化强国的战略先导 教育是人类文明的鲜明特征，是国家强盛的重要标志。新中国成立前，我国是一个文盲半文盲占人口绝大多数，文化、经济十分落后的半封建半殖民地国家。新中国成立之初，我国5亿多人口中，文盲达80%，农村的文盲率更高达95%以上。要把这样一个无论经济还是文化都十分落后的农业国改变成为一个现代化工业国，大办教育，尽快提高广大劳动者科学文化素质，是一个迫切需要解决的重大问题。为此，党中央向全国人民发出了向科学文化进军的伟大号召，并从军队率先做起，开展了全国规模的群众性文化教育运动。经过长期不懈的努力，我国从文盲半文盲大国到教育大国、迈向教育强国，全国人民的科学文化素质大幅跃升，为社会主义革命和建设奠定了雄厚的科学文化基础，提供了充裕的人力和人才资源。 党的十八大以来，我们党高度重视教育事业和教育工作，以高度的历史自觉和坚强的战略定力，坚持把教育作为国之大计、党之大计，作出加快教育现代化、建设教育强国的重大决策，推动新时代教育事业取得历史性成就、发生格局性变化。当前，我国已建成世界上规模最大的教育体系，教育现代化发展总体水平已跨入世界中上国家行列，教育强国指数已位居全球第23位，比2012年上升26位。这些事实雄辩地证明，把建设教育强国作为全面建成社会主义现代化强国的战略先导，坚持走中国特色社会主义教育发展道路是完全正确的，充分体现了我们党对社会主义建设规律的深刻认识和科学把握。 实现高水平科技自立自强的重要支撑 面对世界百年未有之大变局的加速演进和国际环境的日益错综复杂，科技创新正在成为国际战略博弈的主要战场，围绕科技制高点的竞争空前激烈。习近平总书记强调，“当今世界的竞争说到底是人才竞争、教育竞争”“我国要实现高水平科技自立自强，归根结底要靠高水平创新人才”。实现高水平科技自立自强，教育是最具基础性、战略性的重要支撑。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央始终坚持科技是第一生产力、人才是第一资源、创新是第一动力，坚持教育优先发展、科技自立自强、人才引领驱动，整体谋划、总体部署、统筹推进教育强国、科技强国、人才强国，既突出了教育的优先地位和作用，又做到了教育强国、科技强国、人才强国的整体联动和协调推进。 坚持把教育的重点放在高科技创新拔尖人才的培养上。培养什么人、怎样培养人、为谁培养人是教育的根本问题，也是建设教育强国的核心问题。党的十八大以来，我们党始终把培养德智体美劳全面发展的社会主义建设者和接班人作为教育的根本任务。前进道路上，我们要进一步加强科学教育、工程教育，加强拔尖创新人才自主培养，为解决我国关键核心技术攻关提供人才支撑；系统分析我国各方面人才发展趋势及缺口状况，根据科学技术发展态势，聚焦国家重大战略需求，动态调整优化高等教育学科设置，有的放矢培养国家战略人才和急需紧缺人才，提升教育对高质量发展的支撑力、贡献力；统筹职业教育、高等教育、继续教育协同创新，推进职普融通、产教融合、科教融汇，源源不断培养高素质技术技能人才、大国工匠、能工巧匠。努力引导各级优秀创新人才以实现我国高水平科技自立自强为奋斗目标，聚精会神搞创新，一心一意谋突破，大力营造高科技领域支持创造鼓励创新的良好氛围，最大程度地发挥建设教育强国对实现高水平科技自立自强的重要支撑作用。 促进全体人民共同富裕的有效途径 教育是提高人民综合素质、促进人的全面发展的重要途径，具有安民富民的功能与价值。我们要深刻认识和精准把握建设教育强国在促进全体人民共同富裕中的重要作用，努力发展全民教育、终身教育，建设学习型社会，使教育同人民群众期待更加契合，在更高水平上满足人民群众对教育的需求。党的十八大以来，习近平总书记高度重视教育扶贫工作，作出了一系列重要论述和指示，并亲自指导、部署、检查教育扶贫脱贫工作。他强调指出，“再苦不能苦孩子，再穷不能穷教育”“要把发展教育扶贫作为治本之计，确保贫困人口子女都能接受良好的基础教育，具备就业创业能力，切断贫困代际传递”“把贫困地区孩子培养出来，这才是根本的扶贫之策”“扶贫必扶智”。实践证明，教育是阻断贫困代际传递的重要手段，贯彻建设教育强国战略是促进全体人民共同富裕的善治良策。 发挥建设教育强国对实现全体人民共同富裕的积极促进作用，主要体现在两个方面。一个方面是“富口袋”。即通过接受良好教育，广大人民群众不断增加科学文化知识，增强生产劳动技能，提高脱贫致富本领，通过合法、诚实、勤勉的创造性劳动和创新性生产，实现物质经济生活的更加殷实富足。另一个方面是“富脑袋”。即通过良好教育，真正做到以教润心、以教化人、以教启智，使广大人民群众树立崇高理想，坚定正确信念，培养高尚道德，使其精神世界更加充实富有。“富脑袋”主要是看精气神，“富口袋”主要是看吃穿用。“富脑袋”是靠教育直接作用于人的精神世界，通过心灵的净化，进而实现思想的升华。“富口袋”是靠教育首先作用于提升人的致富能力，找到致富门路，进而在创造物质财富中实现丰衣足食。 以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的基础工程 中国要实现社会主义现代化，中华民族要实现伟大复兴，归根到底靠人才、靠教育，任何时候任何情况下都离不开建设教育强国这项基础性工程。必须把教育事业放在优先位置，深化教育改革，加快教育现代化，办好人民满意的教育。全面建成社会主义现代化强国是一个综合复杂的系统工程，它涵盖了经济、政治、科技、文化、军事、体育、教育、人才等各领域。回顾改革开放以来的伟大历程，我们国家日益繁荣昌盛、经济持续健康发展、人民生活快速改善提升，都要依靠教育的大发展为现代化建设提供充裕的人才保障和强大的智力支持，无一不体现出科技是关键、人才是根本、基础在教育的基本逻辑。所以，以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，加快教育现代化、建设教育强国是关键中的关键，根本中的根本，基础中的基础。 习近平总书记强调，我们要建设的教育强国，是中国特色社会主义教育强国，必须以坚持党对教育事业的全面领导为根本保证，以立德树人为根本任务，以为党育人、为国育才为根本目标，以服务中华民族伟大复兴为重要使命。建设教育强国，落实好立德树人的根本任务，培养一代又一代在社会主义现代化建设中可堪大用、能担重任的栋梁之才，是把中华民族伟大复兴事业不断推向前进的重要保障。我们要坚持不懈用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想铸魂育人，着力加强社会主义核心价值观教育，进一步增强民族凝聚力、巩固全党全国人民团结奋斗的共同思想基础，引导人民群众坚定理想信念，永远听党话、跟党走，确保党的事业和社会主义现代化强国建设后继有人。我们必须以高度的历史自觉和历史主动，积极投身教育强国实践，坚定信心、久久为功，为早日实现教育强国目标而共同努力。 ［作者单位：中央党校（国家行政学院）习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心］,https://web.archive.org/web/20230623225723/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16232568.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230621054824/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16232568.html,2023-06-24 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨deeply understand the great strategic significance of building a strong educational country Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Sun Qingju Editor-in-Chief：Wang Yun 2023-06-21 06:46:35 0,"A deep understanding of the great strategic significance of building a strong educational country ■ Sun Qingju Education is the foundation of the founding of the country, the foundation of a strong country. If the country is to be strong and the nation is to be revitalized, the foundation lies in education, and the key depends on education. General Secretary Xi Jinping in the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the fifth collective study stressed: ""the construction of a strong education country, is a strategic precursor to the comprehensive construction of a strong socialist modernization, is to achieve a high level of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-reliance of the important support, is to promote the common wealth of all the people of the effective way to the Chinese-style modernization of the Chinese nation's great rejuvenation of the foundation of the project in an all-round way. "" We should stand on the height of the strategic overall situation of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, deeply understand the great strategic significance of building a strong educational country, accelerate the construction of a high-quality education system, and vigorously promote the modernization of education. The strategic precursor to building a strong socialist modernization country in a comprehensive manner Education is a distinctive feature of human civilization and an important symbol of national strength. Before the founding of New China, China was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country where illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for the vast majority of the population and where culture and economy were very backward. At the time of the founding of New China, 80 percent of the country's population of more than 500 million was illiterate, and the illiteracy rate in rural areas was even higher, at more than 95 percent. To change such an agricultural country, which is very backward both economically and culturally, into a modernized industrial country, it is an urgent and major problem to organize education and to improve the scientific and cultural quality of the majority of workers as soon as possible. To this end, the Party Central Committee issued a great call to the people of the country to march towards science and culture, and took the lead from the army in launching a nationwide mass culture and education campaign. After a long period of unremitting efforts, China has gone from a large country of illiterate and semi-literate people to a large country of education, and is moving towards a strong country of education; the scientific and cultural quality of the whole country's people has jumped dramatically, laying a strong scientific and cultural foundation for the socialist revolution and construction, and providing abundant human and talent resources. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has attached great importance to the cause of education and education work, and with a high degree of historical consciousness and strong strategic determination, has insisted on education as a major plan of the country and the Party, and has made the major decision of accelerating the modernization of education and constructing a strong educational country, thus pushing the cause of education in the new era to make historic achievements and pattern changes. At present, China has built the largest education system in the world, the overall level of education modernization and development has crossed into the ranks of the world's upper-middle-ranking countries, and the Education Power Index has ranked 23rd globally, up 26 places from 2012. These facts eloquently prove that it is entirely correct to take the construction of a strong education nation as a strategic precursor to the comprehensive completion of a socialist modernization power, and to insist on taking the road of socialist education development with Chinese characteristics, which fully embodies the Party's profound understanding and scientific grasp of the laws of socialist construction. Important support for realizing high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-reliance In the face of the accelerated evolution of the world's unprecedented changes and the increasingly intricate and complex international environment, scientific and technological innovation is becoming the main battleground of the international strategic game, and the competition around the scientific and technological commanding heights is more intense than ever. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""the competition in today's world is, in the final analysis, the competition for talents and education"" and that ""if our country is to achieve a high level of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement, we must rely on a high level of innovative talents in the final analysis"". To realize high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement, education is the most basic, strategic and important support. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always insisted that science and technology is the first productive force, talent is the first resource, innovation is the first driving force, insisted on the priority development of education, science and technology self-reliance and self-reliance, and talent leading and driving, and overall planning, overall deployment, and coordinated the promotion of a strong education, science and technology, and a strong talent, not only highlighting the priority position of education and role, but also to achieve the overall linkage of education, science and technology, and talent. It has not only emphasized the priority status and role of education, but also achieved the overall linkage and coordinated promotion of a strong education, science and technology, and talent country. Adhere to the focus of education on the cultivation of high-tech, innovative and top-notch talents. What kind of people to train, how to train people, and for whom to train people is the fundamental issue of education, and also the core issue of building a strong educational country. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has always taken the cultivation of socialist builders and successors with all-round development of morality, intelligence, physical fitness and aesthetics as the fundamental task of education. On the way forward, we need to further strengthen science education, engineering education, and independent training of top-notch innovative talents, so as to provide talent support for solving the key core technologies of our country; systematically analyze the development trend and shortage of talents in all aspects of our country, dynamically adjust and optimize the disciplinary settings of higher education according to the development trend of science and technology, focusing on the major strategic needs of the country, and cultivate the national strategic talents and urgently needed talents in a targeted way, and improve the quality of education for high-quality education and the development of the country's education. It will also focus on the national strategic needs, dynamically adjust and optimize the disciplinary settings of higher education, targeting the cultivation of national strategic talents and urgently needed talents, and enhance the support and contribution of education to high-quality development; it will coordinate the synergistic innovation of vocational education, higher education and continuing education, and push forward the integration of vocational education and popularization of vocational education, the fusion of industry and education, and the fusion of science and education, so as to continuously cultivate high-quality technical and skilled talents, great national craftsmen, and skilled craftsmen. Efforts will be made to guide outstanding innovative talents at all levels to realize China's high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement as the goal of their struggle, to concentrate on innovation and single-mindedly seek breakthroughs, and to vigorously create a good atmosphere in the field of high-tech that supports creativity and encourages innovation, so as to maximize the important supportive role of building a strong educational country in realizing a high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement. Effective way to promote the common prosperity of all people Education is an important way to improve the comprehensive quality of the people and promote the overall development of people, with the function and value of security and wealth. We should deeply understand and accurately grasp the important role of building a strong educational country in promoting the common prosperity of all people, strive to develop education for all and lifelong education, and build a learning society, so as to make education more in line with the expectations of the people and meet the people's demand for education at a higher level. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has attached great importance to education for poverty alleviation, made a series of important remarks and instructions, and personally guided, deployed and inspected education for poverty alleviation and poverty eradication. He emphasized that ""no matter how hard one suffers, no child should suffer, and no matter how poor one is, no one should be poor in education"" ""We should take the development of education to alleviate poverty as a fundamental solution to ensure that all children of the poor can receive a good basic education, have the ability to work and start their own businesses, and cut off the intergenerational transmission of poverty"" ""To train up children from poor areas is the fundamental poverty alleviation policy"" ""Poverty alleviation must help the poor"". Practice has proved that education is an important means to cut off the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and the implementation of the strategy of building a strong education country is a good policy to promote the common prosperity of all people. The positive contribution of building a strong education system to the realization of the common prosperity of all people is mainly reflected in two aspects. One aspect is ""enriching the pockets"". That is to say, by receiving a good education, the masses of the people will continue to increase their scientific and cultural knowledge, enhance their productive and working skills, improve their ability to escape poverty and become rich, and realize a more solid and prosperous material and economic life through lawful, honest and diligent creative labor and innovative production. Another aspect is to ""enrich the brain"". That is to say, through good education, really to teach the heart, to teach the people, to teach the wisdom, so that the masses of people to set up high ideals, firm correct beliefs, cultivate noble morals, so that their spiritual world is more abundant and rich. ""Rich head"" is mainly to see the spirit, ""rich pockets"" is mainly to see the food and clothing. ""Rich head"" is to rely on education directly on the spiritual world, through the purification of the heart, and then realize the sublimation of thought. ""Rich pockets"" is to rely on education first to enhance the ability of people to get rich, to find a way to get rich, and then in the creation of material wealth to realize the abundance of food and clothing. Modernization of the Chinese style to fully promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation of the basic engineering China to achieve socialist modernization, the Chinese nation to achieve great rejuvenation, in the final analysis, rely on talent, rely on education, at any time in any case are inseparable from the construction of a strong education, this fundamental project. We must give priority to education, deepen education reform, accelerate education modernization, and provide education to the satisfaction of the people. Comprehensively building a strong socialist modernized country is a comprehensive and complex systematic project, which covers various fields such as economy, politics, science and technology, culture, military, sports, education and talents. Reviewing the great course since the reform and opening up, our country's growing prosperity, sustained and healthy economic development, and rapid improvement and upgrading of people's lives all rely on the great development of education to provide abundant talents and strong intellectual support for the construction of modernization, which all reflect the basic logic that science and technology is the key, talents are fundamental, and the foundation is in education. Therefore, to promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization, accelerating the modernization of education and building a strong educational country is the key of the key, the fundamental of the fundamental, and the foundation of the foundation. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that the strong state of education we want to build is a strong state of socialist education with Chinese characteristics, which must take adhering to the Party's overall leadership of the education cause as the fundamental guarantee, establish moral character as the fundamental task, educate people for the Party, educate talents for the country as the fundamental goal, and serve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as the important mission. To build a strong educational country, to implement the fundamental task of promoting moral education, and to cultivate generations of talented people who can be of great use in the construction of socialist modernization and who can take up important responsibilities, is an important guarantee that the cause of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be constantly pushed forward. We must persistently use Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era to cultivate souls and educate people, focus on strengthening education on core socialist values, further enhance national cohesion, consolidate the common ideological foundation of the whole Party and the whole nation for unity and struggle, and guide the people to firmly uphold their ideals and beliefs, to listen to and follow the Party forever, so as to ensure that there will be new successors for the Party's cause and the construction of a strong socialist modernized country. We must take a high degree of historical self-consciousness and historical initiative, actively engage in the practice of a strong education, firm confidence, long-term efforts to achieve the goal of a strong education at an early date and work together.

The author stresses that education is the key to building a prosperous country, and in particular, science and technology self-reliance and talent development are crucial for achieving a high level of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement.

思想战线丨不断提高全党马克思主义水平 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：吴 波 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-06-26 07:03:17 0,不断提高全党马克思主义水平 ■吴 波 在学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育工作会议上，习近平总书记指出：“我们要以这次主题教育为契机，加强党的创新理论武装，不断提高全党马克思主义水平，不断提高党的执政能力和领导水平。”这一重要论述阐明了开展主题教育与提高全党马克思主义水平的内在关联。深入开展学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育，既是贯彻落实党的二十大精神的重大举措，又是提高全党马克思主义水平的崭新行动。深入理解和把握这一重要论述，有助于深化对这次主题教育的认知，增强广大党员参与主题教育的自觉性和主动性。 一 作为中国共产党立党立国、兴党强国的根本指导思想，马克思主义在规定党的特殊性质和塑造党的特殊形象的同时，也赋予党安身立命和事业发展的看家本领和精神支撑。在一百多年的奋斗历程中，马克思主义真理的光芒为中国共产党照亮了前行的道路，马克思主义信仰的力量感召一代代中国共产党人前仆后继、矢志不移。正如习近平总书记在党的二十届一中全会上指出的，“没有马克思主义，就没有中国共产党。拥有马克思主义科学理论指导是党的鲜明品格和独特优势，是党坚定信仰信念、把握历史主动的根本所在”。党的百余年奋斗历程告诉我们，党员的马克思主义水平不是自然生成的，也非一劳永逸，对于中国共产党人来说，这是一个始终需要发挥主观能动性加以认真对待和努力提升的重大课题。 不断提高全党马克思主义水平，是新时代深入开展党的自我革命的必然要求。毛泽东同志曾指出：“如果我们党有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地、实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思列宁主义的同志，就会大大地提高我们党的战斗力量。”坚持把思想建设作为党的首要和根本建设，不断提高全党马克思主义水平，是党保持先进性、纯洁性和增强凝聚力、战斗力的重要经验。在充分肯定党的十八大以来理论武装实践取得显著成效的同时，还必须看到，党员队伍中学不进去的有之，一知半解者有之，学用脱节者有之。在真学真信真懂真用、学懂弄通做实方面存在的这些问题，向党的理论武装工作提出了改进的需求。新时代推进党的自我革命是一个复杂的系统工程，不断提高全党马克思主义水平是其中的基础性构成，很显然，这一任务依然很现实地呈现在我们面前。 不断提高全党马克思主义水平，是新时代持续推进伟大社会革命的必然要求。以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，是中国共产党带领全国人民迈上新征程的重大使命。无论是中国式现代化还是中华民族伟大复兴，都只有纳入社会主义的理论框架中才能作出正确的理解。这场超越性探索，是前无古人的开创性事业，既需要中国共产党主观能动性的有力发挥，又需要高超的马克思主义水平作为坚实的支撑。当前，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，只有不断提高全党马克思主义水平，才能穿透纷繁复杂的表象，准确认识和把握世界历史的发展趋势和中国发展新的历史方位，增强历史主动精神，抓住历史变革时机，有效克服前进道路上的各种艰难险阻，成功应对可以预料和难以预料的各种风险考验，胜利推进强国建设、民族复兴的历史伟业，不断开创中国特色社会主义事业发展的新局面。 二 马克思主义水平具有丰富的内涵要求，既包含马克思主义的理论水平、运用水平和发展水平，又包含党的理论武装水平。始终将理论创新与理论武装辩证统一起来，坚持理论创新每前进一步，理论武装就跟进一步，是中国共产党在百余年奋斗历程中提高全党马克思主义水平的一条重要经验。理论武装是科学性与艺术性相统一的实践，理论武装水平的实际状况，对于提高马克思主义水平的实践成效有着直接的重要影响，党的理论武装水平始终是提高全党马克思主义水平的一个重要前提。提高全党马克思主义水平的问题一经提出，如何提高党的理论武装水平就自然地成为我们需要直面的重要课题。 能否真正掌握马克思主义立场观点方法并用以思考和解决中国问题，是检验党的理论武装水平的根本标尺。提高党的理论武装水平，首先应进一步深化对这一实践目标的认识。马克思主义立场观点方法蕴含马克思主义世界观与方法论的辩证统一、真理观与价值观的辩证统一，把马克思主义立场观点方法学到手，就掌握了马克思主义的精髓，也就真正拥有了看家本领。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是马克思主义中国化时代化的最新理论成果，深化了我们党对共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律和人类社会发展规律的认识，为新时代中国共产党人提供了认识世界和改造世界的强大思想武器。深化对党的理论武装实践目标的认识，就要深入学习领会贯穿习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的立场观点方法，自觉用以改造主客观世界，真正把马克思主义看家本领学到手。 主题教育是我们党在长期的思想建设中探索形成的重要实践形式。提高党的理论武装水平，需要从内容和形式两个方面进一步深化对主题教育的规律性认识。一方面，深入了解党员干部知识结构和思想状况，将之与学习内容的设计和安排紧密联系起来，坚持干什么就重点学什么、缺什么就重点补什么的原则方针，不断提高知识补充的精准化水平；另一方面，深化对党员干部思想教育形式有效性的反思。有的地方和单位主题教育的效果不显著有诸多原因，除了内容的主观性供给外，单一的灌输形式也是值得关注的一个重要方面。应充分尊重党员干部在学习实践中的主体地位，不断提升学习教育形式的针对性和有效性。推进马克思主义理论创新必须联系具体实际，同样道理，党的理论武装也必须联系具体实际。深化对主题教育的规律性认识，就要大力弘扬理论联系实际的马克思主义学风，一切从实际出发，丰富和创新学习教育形式，坚决摒弃形式主义和走过场行为，不断提高主题教育质效。 三 知是行之始，行是知之成，“学思想”最终要落实到“见行动”上。马克思主义的运用水平是马克思主义水平的重要体现。具体地说，不能仅从获得了多少马克思主义理论知识来评判党员干部的马克思主义水平，更应从实践的维度来确认党员干部的马克思主义水平。在学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育的顶层设计上，党中央将“学思想、强党性、重实践、建新功”作为总要求提出来，将“坚持学思用贯通、知信行统一”作为根本任务提出来，体现了我们党对实践性这一马克思主义理论品格的深刻理解和忠实践行。历史的经验告诉我们，学习马克思主义理论的全部意义在于运用。帮助广大党员干部正确运用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想观察时代、把握时代、引领时代，积极识变应变求变，解决各种矛盾问题，防范化解重大风险，推动中国式现代化取得新进展新突破，这是新时代我们党不断强化理论武装实践的根本出发点和落脚点。 增强运用马克思主义解决中国问题的能力和水平，必须强化对党的实事求是思想路线的贯彻执行。作为马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化契合的一个经典例证，实事求是是中国话语对马克思主义的精髓和活的灵魂的准确阐释，蕴含着一百多年来中国共产党人艰辛曲折探索的经验总结。习近平总书记强调：“我们过去取得的一切成就都是靠实事求是。今天，我们要把中国特色社会主义事业继续推向前进，还是要靠实事求是。”实事求是是马克思主义价值观和认识论的辩证统一，坚持从中国的具体实际出发，与坚持一切为了人民、一切依靠人民是根本一致的。始终保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，自觉问需于民、问计于民，向人民群众学习，是提高马克思主义运用水平的重要途径。 增强运用马克思主义解决中国问题的能力和水平，必须坚持发扬斗争精神。斗争精神是马克思主义政党改造客观世界必须保持的精神状态，是中国共产党在一百多年的伟大实践中积淀的宝贵精神品质，也是新时代中国共产党人必须具备的精气神。党的十八大以来，习近平总书记反复强调，要“进行具有许多新的历史特点的伟大斗争”，在党的二十大报告中把“务必敢于斗争、善于斗争”作为“三个务必”的重要内容，把“坚持发扬斗争精神”作为前进道路上必须牢牢把握的重大原则之一，体现了我们党对发扬斗争精神的高度重视。新征程是充满光荣和梦想的远征，必然会面对许多重大挑战、重大风险、重大阻力、重大矛盾，要求我们敢于斗争、善于斗争，在强化理论武装中把握斗争规律、增强斗争艺术，通过顽强斗争打开事业发展新天地，推动党的远大理想和现实目标一步步变为生动实践。 （作者系中国社会科学评价研究院研究员）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230627000603/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16233238.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230626094146/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16233238.html,2023-06-27 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨Continuously Improve the Level of Marxism in the Whole Party Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Wu Bo Editor-in-Chief：Sun Yue 2023-06-26 07:03:17 0,"Continuously improve the level of Marxism of the whole party ■ Wu Bo At the working conference on the theme of education for learning and implementing Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""we should take this theme of education as an opportunity to strengthen the Party's armament of innovative theories, continuously improve the level of Marxism of the whole party, and constantly improve the Party's ability to govern and the level of leadership. "" This important exposition clarifies the intrinsic connection between carrying out thematic education and raising the level of Marxism of the whole party. Carrying out in-depth thematic education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era is both a major initiative to implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and a brand-new action to improve the level of Marxism of the whole Party. An in-depth understanding and grasp of this important exposition will help deepen the knowledge of this thematic education and enhance the self-consciousness and initiative of the majority of Party members to participate in thematic education. As the fundamental guiding ideology of the CPC in establishing the Party and the country and in strengthening the Party and the country, Marxism, while defining the special nature of the Party and shaping the Party's special image, also provides the Party with the watchword and spiritual support for the Party's survival and career development. In the course of more than a century of struggle, the light of Marxism's truth has illuminated the road ahead for the CPC, and the power of Marxism's beliefs has inspired generations of CPC members to follow in their footsteps with unswerving determination. As General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out at the First Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, ""Without Marxism, there is no CPC. Possessing the scientific theoretical guidance of Marxism is the distinctive character and unique advantage of the Party, and it is fundamental to the Party's firm beliefs and convictions and its ability to grasp the initiative of history."" The Party's struggle for more than 100 years tells us that the level of Marxism of Party members is not naturally generated, nor is it permanent; for the CPC, it is a major issue that always requires the exertion of subjective initiative to be taken seriously and efforts to be made to improve it. Continuously improving the level of Marxism of the whole Party is an inevitable requirement for the Party's self-revolution to be carried out in depth in the new era. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out, ""If our party has one hundred to two hundred comrades who have learned Marxism-Leninism systematically rather than piecemeal, practically rather than vacuously, it will greatly improve our party's fighting strength."" Adhering to ideological construction as the Party's primary and fundamental construction and constantly raising the level of Marxism in the Party as a whole is an important experience for the Party to maintain its advancement and purity and to enhance its cohesion and combat power. In fully affirmed the party's eighteen years since the theory of armed practice has achieved remarkable results at the same time, we must also see that the party team in the middle of the not into it, a half-understanding of it, learning to use the disconnect between it. These problems in the real learning really believe really understand really use, learn to understand and understand to do practical aspects, to the party's theoretical armament work put forward the need to improve. Promoting the Party's self-revolution in the new era is a complex systematic project, and constantly improving the level of Party-wide Marxism is a fundamental component of it, and it is obvious that this task is still very real in front of us. Continuously improving the level of Party-wide Marxism is an inevitable requirement for the continued promotion of the great social revolution in the new era. Comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization is the major mission of the CPC in leading the whole nation on a new journey. Both Chinese-style modernization and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can only be correctly understood by incorporating them into the theoretical framework of socialism. This transcendental exploration is a pioneering undertaking that no one has ever undertaken before, and it requires both the powerful play of the CPC's subjective initiative and a high level of Marxism as a solid support. At present, the world's unprecedented changes are accelerating, China's development has entered a period of strategic opportunities and risks and challenges, and the number of uncertain and unpredictable factors has increased. Only by constantly improving the level of Marxism of the whole party can we penetrate the complicated appearances, accurately recognize and grasp the development trend of world history and China's development in its new historical orientation, enhance the spirit of historical initiative, seize the opportunity of historical change, and effectively overcome all the difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead. We can effectively overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles on the road, successfully cope with all kinds of risks and tests, both predictable and unpredictable, and triumphantly push forward the historical cause of building a strong nation and rejuvenating the nation, so as to continuously create a new situation for the development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. II The level of Marxism has rich connotative requirements, encompassing both the level of Marxism's theory, application and development, and the level of the Party's theoretical armament. It is an important experience of the CPC to raise the level of Marxism of the whole party during its more than 100 years of struggle that it has always dialectically united theoretical innovation and theoretical arming, and insisted that theoretical arming should follow every step forward in theoretical innovation. Theoretical arming is a practice that unifies science and art, and the actual condition of the level of theoretical arming has a direct and important impact on the effectiveness of the practice of improving the level of Marxism, and the level of theoretical arming of the Party has always been an important prerequisite for improving the level of Marxism of the whole Party. Once the question of improving the level of Marxism of the whole party is raised, how to improve the level of theoretical armament of the party will naturally become an important topic that we need to face directly. Whether we can truly master the Marxist position and viewpoint methods and use them to think about and solve China's problems is the fundamental yardstick for testing the level of the Party's theoretical armament. To improve the level of the Party's theoretical armament, we should first further deepen our understanding of this practical goal. The Marxist position and viewpoint method embodies the dialectical unity of the Marxist worldview and methodology, and the dialectical unity of the concept of truth and values; if you learn the Marxist position and viewpoint method, you will have mastered the essence of Marxism, and you will really have the ability to look after your family. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest theoretical achievement of the Chineseization and modernization of Marxism, deepening our Party's understanding of the laws of Communist Party governance, socialist construction and human social development, and providing a powerful ideological weapon for the CPC people of the new era to understand the world and transform it. To deepen the understanding of the Party's theoretical armament practice goal, we should deeply study and comprehend the position and viewpoint methods throughout Xi Jinping's new era of socialist thought with Chinese characteristics, consciously use them to transform the subjective and objective world, and truly learn the Marxist watchword. Theme education is an important form of practice that our party has explored and formed in its long-term ideological construction. To improve the level of the Party's theoretical armament, it is necessary to further deepen the understanding of the regularity of thematic education in terms of both content and form. On the one hand, in-depth understanding of the knowledge structure and ideological situation of party members and cadres, will be closely linked with the design and arrangement of learning content, adhere to what to do on what to focus on what to learn, what is missing on what to focus on what to make up for the principle of the policy, and constantly improve the level of knowledge supplementation of the precision; on the other hand, deepen the reflection on the effectiveness of the form of ideological education of party members and cadres. Some places and units of the theme of education is not significant for a number of reasons, in addition to the subjective supply of content, a single form of indoctrination is also an important aspect of concern. The subjective position of party members and cadres in learning and practicing should be fully respected, and the relevance and effectiveness of the form of learning and education should be constantly improved. To promote Marxist theoretical innovation must be linked to the specific reality, the same reason, the party's theoretical armament must also be linked to the specific reality. Deepen the understanding of the regularity of the theme of education, we must vigorously carry forward the Marxist style of theory and practice, all from the practical point of view, to enrich and innovate the form of learning and education, and resolutely abandon formalism and excessive behavior, and constantly improve the quality of the theme of education. Knowledge is the beginning of action, action is the realization of knowledge, ""learning ideas"" should ultimately be implemented to ""see action"". The level of application of Marxism is an important reflection of the level of Marxism. Specifically, the level of Marxism of party members and cadres should not be judged only by how much theoretical knowledge of Marxism they have acquired, but also by the dimension of practice. In the top-level design of education on the theme of learning and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the CPC Central Committee has put forward ""learning thoughts, strengthening party spirit, emphasizing practice, and constructing new achievements"" as the general requirement, and ""insisting on the coherence of learning, thinking, and application, and the unity of knowledge, belief, and action"" as the fundamental task. This reflects the Party's deep understanding and faithful practice of the Marxist theoretical character of practicality. Historical experience tells us that the whole point of studying Marxist theory is to apply it. Helping Party members and cadres to correctly apply Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era to observe the times, grasp the times, and lead the times, to actively recognize and respond to changes and seek changes, to solve all kinds of contradictions and problems, to prevent and resolve major risks, and to push for new progress and new breakthroughs in Chinese modernization, is the fundamental starting and ending point for the Party's continuous strengthening of theoretical armament and practice in the new era. Enhancing the ability and level of applying Marxism to solve China's problems must strengthen the implementation of the Party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts. As a classic example of the fit between Marxism and Chinese traditional culture, seeking truth from facts is an accurate interpretation of the essence and living soul of Marxism in Chinese discourse, and contains the summary of the experience of the CPC's painstaking and tortuous exploration over the past one hundred years. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""All our achievements in the past were made by seeking truth from facts. Today, if we want to continue to advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we still have to rely on seeking truth from facts."" Seeking truth from facts is the dialectical unity of Marxist values and epistemology, and the insistence on starting from China's concrete reality is fundamentally consistent with the insistence on doing everything for the people and relying on the people. Maintaining the Party's flesh-and-blood ties with the people at all times, consciously asking for the people's needs, asking for the people's advice, and learning from the people is an important way to improve the use of Marxism. To enhance the ability and level of applying Marxism to solve China's problems, we must insist on carrying forward the spirit of struggle. The spirit of struggle is the state of mind that a Marxist party must maintain to transform the objective world; it is a valuable spiritual quality that the CPC has accumulated in more than a hundred years of great practice, and it is also the essence that CPC members must possess in the new era. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to ""carry out great struggles with many new historical characteristics"", and in the report of the 20th CPC National Congress, he has made ""the necessity to dare to struggle and be good at it"" an important element of the ""three necessities"", and made it an important element of the ""three necessities"" to be ""good at it"". In the report of the Twentieth National Congress of the CPC, ""we must dare to struggle and be good at struggling"" is regarded as an important element of the ""three imperatives"", and ""insisting on carrying forward the spirit of struggle"" is regarded as one of the major principles that must be grasped on the way forward, reflecting the great importance that the CPC attaches to the spirit of struggle. The new journey is an expedition full of glory and dreams, and will inevitably face many major challenges, major risks, major resistance, and major contradictions, which requires us to dare to struggle, be good at struggle, grasp the laws of struggle and enhance the art of struggle in strengthening theoretical armament, open up new horizons of career development through tenacious struggle, and promote the Party's visionary ideals and realistic goals step by step into vivid practice. (The author is a researcher of China Academy of Social Science Evaluation)","The article discusses the importance of continuously improving the level of Marxism among Party members and the importance of ideological front as the primary and fundamental construction of the Party. The goal of promoting the Party's self-revolution in the new era is to improve the level of Marxism among Party members. It is emphasized that learning and applying Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is an important means to achieve this goal. The theme of education is considered a significant initiative to implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and a new action to improve the level of Marxism of the Party. The importance of theory is highlighted in that it is an essential link between Marxists' viewpoint and method, and Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era provides a powerful ideological weapon for the new era of the Party.

However, all changes remain the same, and through the study and analysis of the modernization of national defense and military forces of different countries, we can grasp the internal laws of movement that run through them. Grasp these basic laws, grasp the essential requirements of national defense and military modernization, rich connotation, development trend, can grasp the national defense and military modernization from the inevitable Kingdom to the Kingdom of Liberty to leap forward the historical initiative. Scientific theory driven ""Ideas go before action, just like lightning appears before thunder."" Scientific military theory, revealing the laws of war, the laws of war guidance and the laws of army construction, is the ideological weapon for correctly guiding the war, and has always been a precursor to the modernization of national defense and the army. Scientific military theory can provide ideological guidance, goal guidance, path guidance, method guidance, etc., for the modernization of national defense and the army, and provide the strategic design of scientific development for the modernization of national defense and the army. Whoever grasps a more scientific military theory may seize the first opportunity to win in the modernization of national defense and the army, and win the strategic initiative. To strengthen the drive of scientific theory, we must grasp the world development trend and military development trend, forward-looking response to national security risks and threats of war, adhere to the combination of theory and practice, open the closed-loop loop from practice to theory and then from theory to practice, and realize the benign interaction of theory and practice; we must put theoretical innovation in the first place, vigorously promote the innovation of scientific research mode, vigorously promote the innovation of scientific research method, and go away from the combination of qualitative description and quantitative analysis, logical deduction, and the combination of quantitative analysis, and the combination of qualitative analysis and logical deduction, and the combination of quantitative analysis. It is necessary to put theoretical innovation first, vigorously promote scientific research mode innovation, vigorously promote scientific research method innovation, go away from the combination of qualitative description and quantitative analysis, the combination of logical deduction and technical verification, the combination of specialized research and open research scientific research path, the cycle of iteration, the formation of the ""spiral"" theory generation mode, to make a theoretical breakthrough to lead the modernization of national defense and the army, and to lead the military forces to better play a strategic function. Driven by vivid practice The viewpoint of practice is the primary and basic viewpoint of Marxism. Modernization of national defense and army is the science of practice and a response to practice, which is vivid and increasingly updated. Modernization of national defense and army advances in the contradictory movement of practice. It is the dialectical law of modernization of national defense and army that contradictions and problems keep emerging and being solved in the practical process of modernization of national defense and army. There is no modernization of national defense and army without practical contradictions and problems; there is also no modernization of national defense and army without solving contradictions and problems. Actual combat and training is the basic form of military practice. The army is to prepare for war, all work must adhere to the combat effectiveness of the only fundamental standard, the modernization of national defense and the army must be able to fight and win the war focus. To strengthen the drive of vivid practice, it is necessary to be good at making scientific theoretical summaries of the most vivid practical experience of modernization of national defense and the military, especially by scientifically summing up and applying the lessons learned from direct or indirect war practice and military training activities, guiding the new practice of modernization of national defense and the military with innovative scientific theories, and constantly reinforcing the solid practical support and distinctive practical features of modernization of national defense and the military. The history of national defense and army modernization shows that practice, especially war practice, not only pulls the direction of national defense and army modernization, but also measures and tests the results of national defense and army modernization. The period of war preparation and war confrontation is often an important period of rapid development of national defense and army modernization, and the modernization that comes out of fighting is often more combat and deterrent. Driven by advanced science and technology Marxism believes that science is the ""revolutionary force in the highest sense"". Science and technology are powerful means for mankind to put the forces of nature to work for them, and they are a powerful lever for economic and social development. Every major scientific discovery has led to a leap in mankind's understanding of the objective world; every technological revolution has improved mankind's ability to transform the objective world. Science and technology is a powerful engine for development and an inexhaustible driving force for the modernization of national defense and the military. Leaving science and technology innovation as the ""master switch"", the engine of national defense and military modernization will stall, and the pace of change will come to a halt. And any country, nation or individual that can take the lead in applying advanced science and technology to military purposes will always be able to gain a huge first-mover advantage in the modernization of national defense and the military. To strengthen the drive of advanced science and technology, it is necessary to continuously improve the cognitive power of science and technology, layout and plan ahead, actively promote scientific and technological innovation, seize the high point of science and technology, aim at the key areas that make significant contributions to the enhancement of combat effectiveness, unswervingly carry out strategic, leading and subversive technology research and study, accelerate the breakthrough of key core technologies, and occupy a place in some strategic areas of contention; it is necessary to deeply excavate modern science and technology, strengthen the tracking, monitoring and early warning of emerging frontier technologies represented by disruptive technologies, actively capture, haul, plan, promote and nurture the development of disruptive technologies, build equipment systems, form combat forces, innovate operational concepts and optimize organizational forms on the basis of disruptive technologies, and accelerate the formation of new combat forces with new principles and mechanisms, as well as scientific and efficient institutions, mechanisms and force structures. system, in order to seize the first opportunity to win in the future war. First-class talent drive Knowledge is power, talent is the future. Knowledge is power, talent is the future. The way to strengthen the army is to get people. Talent is the basis for building and governing the army, the first strategic resource for national defense and army modernization, and a key factor in promoting the high-quality development of national defense and army modernization and winning the initiative in military competition and future wars. Obviously, who has a group of first-class talents, who will be able to take advantage of scientific and technological innovation, win the first opportunity in military competition, and take the lead in the process of modernization of national defense and the army. National defense and army modernization, not only the urgent need for a large number of modern weapons and equipment, but also need to master the modern knowledge of the first-class talent group for this unremitting struggle to continue to struggle. To strengthen the drive of first-class talents, we must firmly establish the concept that human resources are the first strategic resources, adhere to the preparation of talents for war, promote the ability and quality of military personnel, structural layout, development and management of a comprehensive transformation and upgrading, and forging a new type of high-quality, specialized military personnel with both integrity and talent; we must discover talents in the practice of innovation, cultivate talents in innovative activities, and unite talents in innovative undertakings, and cultivate a large-scale, reasonably structured, and qualified military personnel, who will be the first in the modernization process of national defense and army. It is necessary to create a good innovative environment, accelerate the formation of a training mechanism conducive to the growth of talents, a utilization mechanism conducive to making the best use of talents, an incentive mechanism conducive to the growth of competing talents, and a competition mechanism conducive to the different types of talents to stand out, to cultivate the fertile soil for the growth of talents, and to provide the modernization of the national defense and the army with strong support for the talents and inexhaustible The modernization of national defense and the military will provide strong support for talents and inexhaustible intellectual power. The national defense and army is a complex system. The complexity of the system refers to the complexity of the internal components of the military, as well as the complexity of the linkage between the military system and other systems. Correspondingly, the modernization of national defense and the military is also a complex process, in which the internal elements of the military system, the external political, economic, scientific and technological, social and other areas of the integrated linkage, coordinated operation, thus forming a metabolism, self-transcendence of endogenous innovation, and promote the iterative development of modernization. It can be said that the modernization of national defense and army is the militarized presentation and centralized application of the national strategic system and strategic capabilities, and the game interaction and mutual learning in the world and the coordinate system of the times. To strengthen the one linkage drive, we must see that the modernization of national defense and the army is not a single aspect, a single element of the unidimensional advancement, but the overall coordination of the various elements, the overall advancement, if the development of the elements of the combat power mismatch, uncoordinated, not only the respective innovation power can not be effectively released, but also the formation of mutual constraints on the internal friction; we must see that the modernization of national defense and the army as an important part of national modernization, must rely on the modernization of the country. As an important part of the modernization of the country, the modernization of national defense and the military must rely on the modernization of the country as a large system, matching and coordinating, in order to form a good pattern of synchronous development of economic construction and national defense construction, and coordinated advancement of a strong country and a strong military; it is necessary to soberly see the modernization of the national defense and the military is a global resonance of the same frequency in every dimension, and we must be open minded to observe the world, benchmarking the first-class, and learning from the advanced, so as to innovate and surpass. There is no real modernization without world vision, strategic thinking and international comparison. Reform and innovation drive Reform is the road to a strong army, and a key move to determine the future of the army; innovation is the first driving force to lead development, and a gas pedal of national defense and army modernization. ""Those who fly far away should change their new feathers."" For an army, the only way to win the future battlefield and defend national security and interests is to dare to change and reshape itself, and to be brave enough to beat the current and ride the tide. Reform and innovation has become an important strategy for many countries and militaries to seek competitive advantage, a key variable in the success or failure of the great power game, the life and death of the army, and a powerful driving force for the modernization of the national defense and the army. To strengthen the reform and innovation drive, we must resolutely overcome all kinds of conventional mentality, conventional thinking and old-fashioned practices, and actively promote innovation in military theory, military technology, military organization and military management, so that military innovation walks in front of the war; we must further strengthen the strategic management, accelerate to promote the effectiveness of the core, precision-oriented military management revolution, and give full play to the role of the reform and innovation drive; we must focus on the scientific and technological frontiers of technology, and through the study of the changes of war, the rise of life and death of the key variables, become a powerful driving force of national defense and military modernization. In order to achieve a new leap in national defense strength with new development achievements, and to promote the modernization of national defense and the military from ""quantitative"" value-added to ""qualitative"" innovation, we must further strengthen strategic management, accelerate the promotion of the efficiency-centered and precision-oriented military management revolution, and give full play to the role of reform and innovation; we must keep a close eye on the cutting-edge technology of science and technology, and study and judge the changes in the war, practice methods of warfare and training, and search for the rationale of victory. The modernization of national defense and the military will be promoted from ""quantitative"" value-added to ""qualitative"" improvement.","This article discusses the inner drive of national defense and military modernization. It emphasizes the importance of military theory, vivid practice, advanced science and technology, first-class talent drive, and reform and innovation drive.

思想战线丨充分认识“六个必须坚持”的内在逻辑 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：董振华 责任编辑：刘秋丽 2023-07-05 06:42:44 0,充分认识“六个必须坚持”的内在逻辑 ■董振华 习近平总书记指出：“党的二十大报告提出了继续推进理论创新的科学方法，即必须坚持人民至上、必须坚持自信自立、必须坚持守正创新、必须坚持问题导向、必须坚持系统观念、必须坚持胸怀天下。”“六个必须坚持”的世界观和方法论，既坚持了马克思主义的基本原理，也蕴含着中华优秀传统文化的智慧和精华，是中国共产党人立足中国具体实际治国理政的经验总结与智慧凝练。学懂弄通做实习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，必须充分认识“六个必须坚持”的内在逻辑，学深悟透蕴含其中的道理学理哲理。 必须坚持人民至上。历史唯物主义科学地阐明了人民群众在社会历史发展中的主体地位和决定性作用，认为历史活动是群众的事业，人民群众是历史的创造者，在创造社会财富的同时，也创造和变革社会关系，是社会变革的决定性力量。坚持人民至上，要求我们树牢群众观点这一根本观点。群众观点，即“相信人民群众自己解放自己，全心全意为人民服务，一切向人民群众负责，虚心向人民群众学习”。群众观点是中国共产党将马克思主义群众观与中国革命实践相结合的产物，彰显了中国共产党对人民主体地位、人民群众与党的关系的深刻理解和把握。坚持人民至上，要求我们践行群众路线这一党的根本领导方法和工作方法。群众路线，即“一切为了群众，一切依靠群众，从群众中来，到群众中去”。群众路线坚持了马克思主义的认识论和唯物史观的基本观点，是党的生命线和根本工作路线。坚持人民至上，贯彻以人民为中心的发展思想，坚持发展依靠人民、发展为了人民、发展成果由人民共享，始终保持党同人民的血肉联系，把全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨落到实处，这是我们党无往而不胜的传家法宝，也是我们党永葆青春活力和强大战斗力的关键所在。 必须坚持自信自立。自信是我们党在长期斗争中淬炼出的精神气质，自立是立党立国的重要原则。不自信，则精神上陷于被动，难以实现自立；不自立，则无自信，更无思想自觉和行动自觉。坚持自信自立，是唯物史观的重要体现，它不是抽象的、盲目的，而是具体的、历史的。我们党在各个历史时期，始终坚持从我国国情出发，探索并形成了符合中国实际的新民主主义革命道路、社会主义改造和社会主义建设道路、中国特色社会主义道路，这种独立自主的探索精神，这种坚持走自己路的坚定决心，正是我们党坚持自信自立的具体体现。坚持自信自立，还是“中国的问题必须从中国基本国情出发，由中国人自己来解答”的方法论。党的二十大报告指出：“党的百年奋斗成功道路是党领导人民独立自主探索开辟出来的，马克思主义的中国篇章是中国共产党人依靠自身力量实践出来的，贯穿其中的一个基本点就是中国的问题必须从中国基本国情出发，由中国人自己来解答。”一直以来，我们始终坚定道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信，以更加积极的历史主动精神推进马克思主义中国化时代化，既不刻舟求剑、封闭僵化，也不照抄照搬、食洋不化，而是在自己选择的道路上昂首阔步走下去，坚持把国家和民族发展放在自己力量的基点上、把中国发展进步的命运牢牢掌握在自己手中，充分彰显了自信自立的意志品格。 必须坚持守正创新。“守正才能不迷失方向、不犯颠覆性错误，创新才能把握时代、引领时代”，这是我们党在长期革命、建设和改革实践中总结出的宝贵经验。坚持守正创新，体现了中国共产党人以科学的态度对待科学、以真理的精神追求真理的观点。马克思主义是随着实践而不断丰富和发展的，是具体的、鲜活的、开放的理论体系，这就决定了我们必须坚持守正创新，遵循唯物辩证法的基本逻辑，做到具体问题具体分析，用发展着的马克思主义创造性地应对和解决不断遇到的新情况新问题。坚持守正创新，还是既一脉相承又与时俱进的方法论。坚定对马克思主义的信仰，用发展着的马克思主义指导新的实践，必须坚持马克思主义基本原理不动摇，坚持党的全面领导不动摇，坚持中国特色社会主义不动摇；同时，在把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合的基础上，紧跟时代步伐，顺应实践发展，扎根社会实践，面向现实问题，以满腔热忱对待一切新生事物，不断拓展认识的广度和深度，敢于提出新的思路、新的战略、新的举措，不断推动理论创新和实践创新，并不断根据新的实践灵活运用马克思主义解决新的问题。 必须坚持问题导向。辩证唯物主义认为，矛盾是客观存在的，无处不在，无时不有，问题便是事物矛盾的具体表现形式。坚持问题导向，是直面问题的唯物主义观点、矛盾观点、实践观点。这就要求我们在分析和认识现实问题时必须坚持一切从实际出发，具体问题具体分析，在实践活动中把握问题的实质。实践是认识的来源，是解决问题的重要法宝。问题的解决不能靠空对空，必须植根现实，以解决问题为指引，集中全部力量和有效资源攻坚克难，全力化解工作中的突出矛盾和问题。坚持问题导向，内含着注重调查研究的工作方法，是发现问题、分析问题和解决问题的方法论。我们党一直有注重调查研究的优良传统，坚持问题导向，就是要把调查研究作为一项基本功来练，深入基层、深入实践、深入群众，在调查研究的过程中不断发现问题、分析问题、解决问题。中国共产党人坚持问题导向，还体现在为了人民利益坚持真理、修正错误。要有光明磊落、无私无畏、以事实为依据、敢说真话的勇气和正气，及时发现和纠正思想认识上的偏差、决策中的失误、工作中的缺点，及时发现和解决存在的各种矛盾问题，使我们的思想和行动更加符合客观规律、符合时代要求、符合人民愿望。 必须坚持系统观念。系统观念是指用普遍联系的、全面系统的、发展变化的观点把握事物发展规律，是基础性的思想方法和工作方法。它提出从事物的整体性去分析问题和解决问题，避免“只见树木，不见森林”“一叶障目，不见泰山”的片面性；要求把事物作为一个相互联系、相互作用的整体来把握，不仅分析组成系统的每一个要素，还把握要素和要素的关系、要素和整体的关系、整体和部分的关系，避免“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”的机械思维方式；主张从事物的不断运动变化中去把握事物和解决问题，避免“刻舟求剑”的僵化思维方式。坚持系统观念，是推进党和国家各项事业发展的科学思想方法和工作方法。党的十八大以来，从统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局到协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，从经济、政治、社会、文化、生态文明到军事、科技、国防、外交，从“全面建成小康社会，一个也不能少”到扎实推进全体人民共同富裕，中国共产党人始终将系统观念贯穿改革发展各领域，推动实现高质量发展。前进道路上，我们应一以贯之坚持系统观念这一科学的思想方法和工作方法，通过历史看现实、透过现象看本质，把握好全局和局部、当前和长远、宏观和微观、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、特殊和一般等关系，不断提高战略思维、历史思维、辩证思维、系统思维、创新思维、法治思维、底线思维能力，为前瞻性思考、全局性谋划、整体性推进党和国家各项事业提供科学方法论指导。 必须坚持胸怀天下。实现每个人的自由全面发展，是马克思主义理论一以贯之的最高理想、价值追求和逻辑起点。马克思主义就是关于无产阶级革命和人类解放的理论，这天然地赋予马克思主义者胸怀天下的精神气质。坚持胸怀天下，充分彰显了我们党为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同的责任担当。作为马克思主义政党，中国共产党自成立之日起，就具有胸怀天下的国际主义情怀。特别是党的十八大以来，我国始终在谋求自身发展的同时积极推动世界和平与发展，推动构建人类命运共同体，携手各方共建“一带一路”，有力促进了共建国家发展；提出并推动落实全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，倡导建立多元互动的人文交流大格局，弘扬平等、互鉴、对话、包容的文明观，推进多元文明之间的平等对话、互鉴包容、共存共在。坚持胸怀天下，还体现了破解人类文明发展困境的方法论。一方面，全球化的潮流不可阻挡，各国之间相互联系、相互依存日益加深，前途命运愈发紧密相连；另一方面，恃强凌弱、巧取豪夺、零和博弈等霸权霸道霸凌行径危害深重，和平赤字、发展赤字、安全赤字、治理赤字加重，人类社会面临前所未有的挑战。因此，“实现什么样的全球发展、怎样实现全球发展”已然成为重大时代课题。作为对这一重大课题的积极回应，人类命运共同体理念向全世界指明了人类未来发展的正确方向。这一理念是中国共产党人坚持胸怀天下，将马克思主义世界历史理论与人类社会发展实践相结合的方法理念，实现了对马克思主义世界历史理论的创新发展，并从根本上实现了对资本主义生产方式所主导的全球发展模式和秩序的超越，为破解全球发展困境提供了方法路径，在全世界汇聚起和平发展、合作共赢的磅礴力量。 ［作者单位：中共中央党校（国家行政学院）习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心］,https://web.archive.org/web/20230705234822/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16235141.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230705040558/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16235141.html,2023-07-06 0:00:00,"Ideological Front丨Fully understand the internal logic of the ""six must adhere to"" Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Dong Zhenhua Responsibility: Liu Qiuli 2023-07-05 06:42:44 0","Fully understand the internal logic of the ""six must adhere to"" ■ Dong Zhenhua General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: ""The report of the 20th Party Congress puts forward the scientific method of continuing to promote theoretical innovation, namely, must adhere to the people first, must adhere to self-confidence and self-reliance, must adhere to the right and innovative, must adhere to the problem-oriented, must adhere to the systematic concept, must adhere to the world. adhere to the system concept, and must adhere to the world."" The worldview and methodology of the ""six must adhere to"" not only adhere to the basic principles of Marxism, but also contain the wisdom and essence of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, which is a summary of the experience and wisdom of the CPC in governing the country based on the specific reality of China. To learn and understand Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we must fully understand the internal logic of the ""six must adhere to"", and learn and comprehend the reasoning and philosophies contained therein. We must adhere to the supremacy of the people. Historical materialism scientifically elucidates the main position and decisive role of the people in the historical development of society, that historical activity is the cause of the masses, and that the people are the creators of history, creating social wealth while creating and transforming social relations, and are the decisive force of social change. Adhering to the supremacy of the people requires us to firmly establish the fundamental viewpoint of the masses. The people's point of view means ""believing that the people will liberate themselves, serving the people wholeheartedly, being accountable to the people, and learning from the people"". The mass viewpoint is a product of the CPC's combination of the Marxist view of the masses with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and highlights the CPC's profound understanding and grasp of the people's subject position and the relationship between the people and the Party. Adhering to the people's supremacy requires us to practice the mass line, which is the fundamental leadership and working method of the Party. The mass line means ""all for the masses, all relying on the masses, coming from the masses and going to the masses"". The mass line adheres to the basic viewpoints of Marxist epistemology and materialistic view of history, and is the lifeblood and fundamental working line of the Party. Adhering to the people's supremacy, implementing the people-centered development ideology, insisting that development depends on the people, development is for the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, always maintaining the Party's flesh-and-blood connection with the people, and putting the fundamental tenet of serving the people wholeheartedly into practice, this is the heirloom of the Party that has made it invincible and is the key to the Party's everlasting vitality and strong combat power. We must insist on self-confidence and self-reliance. Self-confidence is our party in the long-term struggle to refine the spirit of temperament, self-reliance is an important principle of the founding of the party and the country. Without self-confidence, the spirit is trapped in passivity, difficult to realize self-reliance; not self-reliance, no self-confidence, and even more so, no ideological self-awareness and self-awareness of action. Adherence to self-confidence and self-reliance is an important embodiment of the materialist concept of history, which is not abstract and blind, but concrete and historical. Our party in various historical periods, always adhere to the national conditions of our country, explored and formed in line with the reality of China's new democratic revolution road, socialist transformation and socialist construction road, socialism with Chinese characteristics road, this independent spirit of exploration, this adhere to their own way of determination, it is the party adhere to the specific embodiment of self-confidence and self-reliance. Adherence to self-confidence and self-reliance is also the methodology that ""China's problems must be answered by the Chinese themselves in the light of China's basic national conditions"". The report of the 20th Party Congress pointed out: ""The Party's century of struggle for success is the Party's leadership of the people to explore independently and autonomously opened up the Chinese chapter of Marxism is the Communist Party of China to rely on their own strength to practice, through which a basic point is that China's problems must be started from China's basic national conditions, by the Chinese people to answer their own. "" All along, we have always been firm in our road confidence, theoretical confidence, institutional confidence and cultural confidence, and have promoted the Chineseization of Marxism with a more positive spirit of historical initiative, neither carving out a boat to seek a sword, closing it up and ossifying it, nor copying it and eating it, but rather, we have gone on with head high on the road of our own choosing, and have insisted on placing the development of the country and the nation at the base of our own strength, and on placing the fate of China's development and progress firmly in our own hands. The fate of China's development and progress is firmly in its own hands, fully demonstrating the character of self-confidence and self-reliance. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of keeping the right and innovating. ""It is only by keeping the right course that we can keep from losing our way and making subversive mistakes, and it is only by innovating that we can grasp the times and lead the way."" This is a valuable lesson that the Party has learned from its long practice of revolution, construction and reform. Insisting on keeping the right and innovating embodies the view that the CPC treats science with a scientific attitude and pursues truth with the spirit of truth. Marxism is constantly enriched and developed with practice, and is a concrete, vivid and open theoretical system, which determines that we must adhere to the right and innovation, follow the basic logic of material dialectics, do specific analysis of specific problems, and creatively respond to and solve the new situations and new problems encountered constantly with the developing Marxism. Adhering to the principle of keeping justice and innovation is also a methodology that is both inherited and advancing with the times. To firmly believe in Marxism and guide new practices with developing Marxism, it is necessary to adhere to the basic principles of Marxism without wavering, the Party's overall leadership without wavering, and socialism with Chinese characteristics without wavering; at the same time, on the basis of combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's excellent traditional culture, we must follow the pace of the times, conform to the development of practice, take root in social practice, and face real problems with an eye to the future. social practice, facing real problems, treating all new things with enthusiasm, constantly expanding the breadth and depth of understanding, daring to put forward new ideas, new strategies and new initiatives, constantly pushing forward theoretical and practical innovations, and constantly applying Marxism flexibly to solve new problems according to new practices. Problem orientation must be adhered to. Dialectical materialism believes that contradictions exist objectively, everywhere and everywhere, and problems are the specific manifestations of things contradictory. Adherence to problem orientation is the materialist viewpoint, contradiction viewpoint, and practical viewpoint of facing problems head on. This requires us to analyze and understand the reality of the problem when we must adhere to all from the practical point of view, specific analysis of specific problems, to grasp the essence of the problem in practical activities. Practice is the source of understanding and an important magic weapon for solving problems. Problems can not be solved by empty space, must be rooted in reality, to solve the problem as a guide, focusing all the strength and effective resources to overcome the difficulties, and make every effort to resolve the outstanding contradictions and problems in the work. Adhere to the problem-oriented, embedded in the focus on investigation and research work methods, is to find problems, analyze problems and solve problems methodology. Our party has always had a fine tradition of focusing on investigation and research, adhere to the problem orientation, is to investigate and research as a basic skill to practice, in-depth grassroots, in-depth practice, in-depth masses, in the process of investigation and research continue to find problems, analyze problems, solve problems. The CPC's insistence on problem orientation is also reflected in its insistence on truth and correction of errors for the sake of the people's interests. We must have the courage and righteousness to be bright, selfless, based on facts, and dare to speak the truth, promptly discover and correct deviations in ideological understanding, mistakes in decision-making, and shortcomings in work, and promptly discover and solve all kinds of contradictions and problems, so as to make our thoughts and actions more in line with the objective law, the requirements of the times, and the people's aspirations. Must adhere to the system concept. System concept refers to the use of universally linked, comprehensive and systematic, development and change of the point of view to grasp the law of development of things, is the basic method of thought and work. It proposes to analyze and solve problems from the wholeness of things, avoiding the one-sidedness of ""only seeing trees, not seeing forests"" and ""not seeing mountains""; it requires that things be grasped as an interconnected, interacting whole, and that each element of the system be analyzed, but also be grasped. Each element of the system, but also to grasp the relationship between elements and elements, elements and the relationship between the whole, the whole and part of the relationship, to avoid ""headache, foot"" mechanical way of thinking; advocate from the constant movement of things to grasp things and solve problems, to avoid the ""boat for the sword! Avoiding the rigid way of thinking of ""seeking a sword in a boat"". Adhering to the concept of system is a scientific method of thinking and working method to promote the development of the Party and the country's undertakings. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, from promoting the ""five-in-one"" overall layout to coordinating the promotion of the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout, from economic, political, social, cultural and ecological civilization to military, science and technology, national defense and foreign affairs, from ""building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects"" to ""building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects"" to ""building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects"". From ""building a moderately affluent society in all aspects, not one person should be left behind"" to solidly promoting the common prosperity of all people, the Chinese communists have always put a systematic concept into all areas of reform and development, and promoted the realization of high-quality development. On the way forward, we should consistently adhere to the system concept as a scientific method of thought and work, look at the reality through history, look at the essence of the phenomenon, grasp the relationship between the overall situation and the local, the current and the long-term, macro and micro, the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, the special and the general, and continue to improve the ability to think strategically, historically, dialectically, systemically, innovatively, in accordance with the rule of law, and the bottom-line thinking, so as to provide the basis for forward-looking thinking, overall development, and to improve the ability to think in a holistic and comprehensive way. In this regard, the Party and the country should provide scientific methodological guidance for forward-looking thinking, overall planning, and holistic promotion of the Party and the country's various undertakings. It is necessary to insist on thinking of the world. Realizing the free and comprehensive development of everyone is the highest ideal, value pursuit and logical starting point of Marxist theory. Marxism is the theory of proletarian revolution and human liberation, which naturally endows Marxists with the spiritual temperament of embracing the world. Adhering to the spirit of being open to the world fully demonstrates the Party's responsibility to seek progress for mankind and to seek a commonwealth for the world. As a Marxist political party, the CPC, since its founding, has been characterized by an internationalist sentiment that embraces the world. Especially since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, China has been actively promoting world peace and development while pursuing its own development, promoting the building of a community of human destiny, joining hands with other parties to build the Belt and Road, and vigorously promoting the development of co-constructed countries; proposing and promoting the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and advocating the establishment of a large pattern of diversified and interactive humanistic exchanges. It has proposed and promoted the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, advocated the establishment of a major pattern of humanistic exchanges based on pluralism and interaction, carried forward the concept of civilization based on equality, mutual appreciation, dialogue and inclusiveness, and pushed forward the equal dialogues, mutual appreciation, inclusiveness and coexistence of multiple civilizations. Insisting on being open to the world also embodies the methodology for solving the development dilemma of human civilization. On the one hand, the trend of globalization is unstoppable, countries are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, and their future and destiny are more and more closely intertwined; on the other hand, hegemonic hegemony and bullying practices such as bullying the strong and the weak, profiteering and zero-sum games have caused serious harm, and the deficits in peace, development, security and governance have worsened, with human society facing unprecedented challenges. Therefore, ""what kind of global development and how to realize it"" has become a major issue of the times. As a positive response to this major issue, the concept of a community of human destiny points out to the world the right direction for the future development of mankind. This concept is a methodological concept that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) insists on combining the Marxist theory of world history with the practice of human social development, realizing the innovative development of the Marxist theory of world history and fundamentally transcending the global development mode and order dominated by the capitalist mode of production, providing a methodological path for solving the dilemmas of global development, and bringing together a powerful force of peace, development and win-win cooperation all over the world.

特稿：凝聚团结共识 促进人类进步——中国共产党推动构建人类命运共同体的时代意义 来源：新华社 作者：陈杉 张远 刘品然 责任编辑：孙智英 2023-07-04 12:24:17 0,中国共产党是为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴的党，也是为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同的党。 “国际社会日益成为一个你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。”习近平总书记立足中国，胸怀世界，深刻思考“建设一个什么样的世界、如何建设这个世界”等重大课题，洞察人类前途命运，把握时代发展大势，指出“构建人类命运共同体是世界各国人民前途所在”。新时代的中国共产党人同各方力量携手前行，为解决人类重大问题，建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界持续贡献中国智慧、中国方案、中国力量。 面对世界百年未有之大变局，构建人类命运共同体理念顺应历史发展趋势，迸发出澎湃的思想伟力，凝聚起世界人民求和平、谋发展、促合作的共同期盼，成为引领时代潮流和人类前进方向的鲜明旗帜。 以思想为旗帜，汇聚应对挑战力量 5月19日，在全场长时间的热烈掌声中，习近平总书记同中亚五国元首共同签署《中国－中亚峰会西安宣言》。“构建更加紧密的中国－中亚命运共同体”作为峰会最重要的政治成果写入宣言文件，中国同中亚五国实现双边层面践行人类命运共同体全覆盖，再次彰显构建人类命运共同体理念的强大影响力、生命力、感召力。吉尔吉斯斯坦政治学者巴克特·巴克塔耶夫说，这一理念为中亚各国“构筑一条通往和平与繁荣的大道”。 放眼世界，地缘冲突、恐怖主义、气候变化等挑战层出不穷；全球经济长期低增长的风险依然存在；一些国家强推“脱钩断链”，扰乱全球产业链、供应链；更有甚者，一些国家固守冷战思维，鼓吹集团对抗，肆意冲撞战后国际秩序……面对加速演进的百年变局，人们期盼更多、更强大的确定性力量。 从2013年在俄罗斯莫斯科国际关系学院的演讲中“开篇破题”，到2015年在第七十届联合国大会一般性辩论上“立柱架梁”，从2017年在联合国日内瓦总部系统阐释“五个世界”愿景，再到2020年倡导共同建设人类卫生健康共同体、2021年呼吁构建全球发展命运共同体、2022年提出共建人类安全共同体……习近平总书记始终着眼世界之问、历史之问、时代之问，不断丰富和拓展构建人类命运共同体理念的内涵外延，为人类携手应对重大危机和全球性挑战提供中国方案，汇聚共识与合力。 埃及共产党总书记萨拉赫·阿德利认为，构建人类命运共同体理念是“中国共产党基于同西方截然不同的坚实政治、文化基础上所构建的全球愿景”。英国48家集团俱乐部副主席基思·贝内特说：“构建人类命运共同体理念倡导共赢、团结，深刻契合当前局势下人们的迫切需求。中国不仅持续完善理论架构，更有落实的详细规划。” 将构建人类命运共同体理念写入党的十九大、二十大报告，载入党章和《中共中央关于党的百年奋斗重大成就和历史经验的决议》，推动写入宪法，陆续提出并践行共建“一带一路”倡议、全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，习近平总书记引领中国共产党矢志不渝地推动人类命运共同体建设。 连续六年写入联大决议，载入上合、金砖等多边机制文件，构建人类命运共同体理念在国际社会赢得广泛认同。中老、中巴、中柬、中泰、中印尼、中哈、中乌、中土、中吉、中塔等双边命运共同体落地生根，亚太、中国-东盟、中国-中亚、上合组织、中非、中阿、中拉、中国-太平洋岛国等命运共同体建设步伐稳健，网络空间、核安全、海洋等命运共同体倡议得到各国积极响应，人与自然生命共同体、地球生命共同体等一系列重大主张获得广泛支持，越来越多的国家和地区加入到构建人类命运共同体的大合唱中。 推动构建人类命运共同体，新的实践成果不断涌现，令人振奋。今年以来，从陆续发布《全球安全倡议概念文件》《关于政治解决乌克兰危机的中国立场》《关于阿富汗问题的中国立场》等文件，到成功斡旋沙特和伊朗实现“北京握手”、积极推动中东迎来“和解潮”，中国以构建人类命运共同体为长远目标，积极践行全球安全倡议，积极探索对话而不对抗、结伴而不结盟、共赢而非零和的新型安全之路，为政治解决热点问题贡献智慧和力量。 两次举办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，深化拓展“金砖+”模式，不断完善中阿、中非、中拉、中国-中东欧国家、中国-中亚国家等合作机制……中国坚定支持广大发展中国家，努力增强新兴市场国家和发展中国家在全球事务中的代表性和发言权，推动全球治理体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。 莫桑比克前总统若阿金·希萨诺说，构建人类命运共同体理念凝聚世界人民求团结、谋发展的意愿，“展现中国共产党开放与合作的胸怀”。伊拉克大学新闻学教授穆罕默德·朱布里说，“构建人类命运共同体理念追求团结合作、互利共赢和可持续发展”，切中国际社会所需。 以人民为中心，共享繁荣发展机遇 今年是中方工作人员张超奋斗在印度尼西亚雅万高铁项目建设一线的第9个年头。印尼同事曾好奇地询问他胸前徽章上“为人民服务”的意义。有着25年党龄的张超说，“就是做让人民感到幸福和美好的工作”，“比如建设雅万高铁就是为了方便人们出行”。 2013年春季，习近平总书记在俄罗斯莫斯科国际关系学院演讲时指出，各国和各国人民应该共同享受发展成果。每个国家在谋求自身发展的同时，要积极促进其他各国共同发展。这一年的金秋，习近平总书记提出共建“一带一路”重大倡议，以宽广胸襟、广阔视角打造开放合作平台，推进全球互联互通。 十年耕耘，“一带一路”已成为构建人类命运共同体的重要实践平台。在埃塞俄比亚援建第一座现代化的全非疾控中心，在尼日利亚修建西非第一大深水港，在乌兹别克斯坦贯通中亚第一长隧道，在马尔代夫架设该国第一座跨海大桥……十年来，共建“一带一路”倡议吸引世界上超过四分之三的国家和32个国际组织参与，显著提升全球互联互通和贸易水平，拉动近万亿美元投资规模，为沿线国家创造42万个工作岗位，让近4000万人摆脱贫困，增进不同地区人文交流，成为造福各国、惠及世界的“幸福路”。 “共建‘一带一路’等重要倡议，源自中国对21世纪人类文明发展现状和规律的深刻理解，各国应相互帮助、共建家园。”白俄罗斯前副总理阿纳托利·托济克说。 习近平总书记说：“中国人历来主张‘世界大同，天下一家’。中国人民不仅希望自己过得好，也希望各国人民过得好。” 面对近年来全球发展遭遇的严峻挑战，中国共产党从以人民为中心的发展思想出发，提出和践行全球发展倡议，有效凝聚了共促发展的国际共识，有力回应了全球性挑战和广大发展中国家的发展需求，得到100多个国家和包括联合国在内的多个国际组织支持。去年6月，习近平总书记在北京主持全球发展高层对话会，提出共创普惠平衡、协调包容、合作共赢、共同繁荣的发展格局，宣布中国落实全球发展倡议32项重要举措，截至目前已有一半实施完成或取得早期成果，得到各方高度评价。 “我们要倾听人民心声，顺应时代潮流，推动各国加强协调和合作，把本国人民利益同世界各国人民利益统一起来，朝着构建人类命运共同体的方向前行。”踏上新征程的中国共产党，正在以高质量发展推进中国式现代化，为各国提供发展新机遇。 打造进博会、消博会等一系列国家级“展会矩阵”，同至少27个国家和地区签署自贸协定，统筹推进21个自由贸易试验区和海南自由贸易港建设，推动《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》高水平实施，申请加入《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》……过去十年来，中国对世界经济增长的平均贡献率超过30%，已成为140多个国家和地区的主要贸易伙伴。 不久前刚闭幕的世界经济论坛第十四届新领军者年会（夏季达沃斯论坛）吸引约1500名人士参会，其中半数来自海外，外方人士希望更多了解中国并发展业务。世界经济论坛主席施瓦布表示，“全世界都从中国发展中受益”。 以文明为火炬，照亮人类前行方向 “在各国前途命运紧密相连的今天，不同文明包容共存、交流互鉴，在推动人类社会现代化进程、繁荣世界文明百花园中具有不可替代的作用。”今年3月，习近平总书记在中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会上提出全球文明倡议，进一步丰富和拓展构建人类命运共同体的实践路径。 中华文明的包容性决定了中华文化对世界文明兼收并蓄的开放胸怀。全球文明倡议倡导尊重世界文明多样性、弘扬全人类共同价值、重视文明传承和创新、加强国际人文交流合作，是新时代中国为国际社会提供的又一重要公共产品。 化解人类面临的突出矛盾和问题，需要依靠物质的手段攻坚克难，也需要依靠精神的力量诚意正心。从举办亚洲文明对话大会、中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会、亚洲文化遗产保护联盟大会等国际会议，到同多国共同举办“文化交流年”、开展经典作品互译和联合考古等活动，新时代中国始终是文明交流互鉴的倡导者、践行者、推动者。墨西哥《千年报》网站文章认为，中国捍卫了文明平等的论点，强调以宽广胸怀理解不同文明的价值内涵。 习近平总书记指出：“推动构建人类命运共同体，不是以一种制度代替另一种制度，不是以一种文明代替另一种文明，而是不同社会制度、不同意识形态、不同历史文化、不同发展水平的国家在国际事务中利益共生、权利共享、责任共担，形成共建美好世界的最大公约数。” 万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。构建人类命运共同体理念倡导秉持平等和尊重，摒弃傲慢和偏见，搭建更多跨越文明隔阂的桥梁，促进各国人民相知相亲，共同建设人与自然和谐共生、经济与环境协同共进、世界各国共同发展的地球家园。埃及前总理埃萨姆·谢拉夫说，构建人类命运共同体理念是“人类文明向前发展的必然选择”。美国中美研究中心高级研究员苏拉布·古普塔认为，中国不将自己的价值观强加于人，而是倡导包容互鉴、共同前进，对世界和平与发展具有重要意义。 命运与共行大道，胸怀天下向未来。构建人类命运共同体理念，深刻诠释了和平与发展的真谛，反映了各国人民的共同心声，散发出超越时空的思想魅力，必将凝聚越来越多共识，推动人类社会迈向光明前程。（参与记者：余谦梁、姚兵、沈丹琳、刘恺、关建武） （新华社北京7月4日电）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230705234822/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16234918.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230704060735/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16234918.html,2023-07-06 0:00:00,Special Feature: Gathering Unity and Consensus and Promoting Human Progress - The Significance of the Communist Party of China in Promoting the Building of a Community of Human Destinies Source: Xinhua News Agency Author: Chen San Zhang Yuan Liu Pinran Editor-in-Chief: Sun Zhiying 2023-07-04 12:24:17 0,"The Communist Party of China (CPC) is a party that seeks the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as progress for mankind and a commonwealth for the world. ""The international community is increasingly becoming a community of destiny in which you have me and I have you."" General Secretary Xi Jinping, based on China and with the world in mind, has profoundly pondered such major issues as ""what kind of world to build and how to build it"", gained insight into the future destiny of mankind, grasped the general trend of the times, and pointed out that ""building a community of shared destiny for mankind is the future of all the peoples of the world. "". The CPC in the new era will work hand in hand with all parties and continue to contribute Chinese wisdom, Chinese programs and Chinese power to solving the major problems of mankind and building a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness and inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty. In the face of the great changes the world has never seen in a hundred years, the concept of building a community of human destiny is in line with the development trend of history, bursting with surging ideological greatness, uniting the common aspirations of the world's people to seek peace, seek development and promote cooperation, and becoming a clear banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of mankind's advancement. Taking thought as a banner, gathering the power to cope with challenges On May 19, in a long and warm applause, General Secretary Xi Jinping and the heads of state of five Central Asian countries signed the Xi'an Declaration of the China-Central Asia Summit. ""Building a closer China-Central Asia community of destiny"" was written into the declaration as the most important political outcome of the summit, and China and the five Central Asian countries have realized the full coverage of practicing the community of human destiny at the bilateral level, which once again highlights the strong influence, vitality and appeal of the concept of building a community of human destiny. Kyrgyz political scientist Bakht Bakhtaev said that this concept ""builds a thoroughfare to peace and prosperity"" for the Central Asian countries. Looking around the world, challenges such as geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and climate change are emerging; the risk of long-term low growth in the global economy still exists; some countries are pushing for ""decoupling and breaking the chain"", disrupting the global industrial chain and supply chain; what's more, some countries are adhering to the Cold War mentality, advocating bloc confrontation, and wantonly bumping into the post-war international order! ...... In the face of a century of accelerating changes, people are looking forward to more and stronger forces of certainty. From ""opening the topic"" in a speech at the Moscow Institute of International Relations in 2013, to ""setting up pillars and frameworks"" at the 70th General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, and systematically explaining the ""five worlds"" at the United Nations Headquarters in Geneva in 2017, the ""five worlds"" are the most important elements in the international community's development agenda. From systematically explaining the vision of the ""five worlds"" at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva in 2017, to advocating the joint construction of a human health community in 2020, calling for the building of a global community of destiny for development in 2021, and proposing the building of a human security community in 2022, General Secretary Xi Jinping has always been focused on the world's questions, historical questions, and questions of the times. questions, historical questions and questions of the times, constantly enriching and expanding the connotation and extension of the concept of building a community of human destiny, providing Chinese solutions for mankind to join hands to deal with major crises and global challenges, and gathering consensus and synergy. Salah Adly, general secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party, believes that the concept of building a community of human destiny is ""a global vision constructed by the CPC based on a solid political and cultural foundation that is very different from that of the West"". Keith Bennett, vice-chairman of the 48 Club, said: ""The concept of building a community of human destiny advocates win-win situation and solidarity, which is deeply in line with the urgent needs of people in the current situation. China not only continues to improve the theoretical framework, but also has a detailed plan for its implementation."" The concept of building a community of human destiny has been written into the reports of the 19th and 20th National Congresses of the Communist Party of China (CPC), enshrined in the Party's Constitution and the CPC Central Committee's Resolution on the Significant Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party's 100-Year Struggle, and promoted to be written into the Constitution, and has been put forward and put into practice in the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative. General Secretary Xi Jinping has led the Communist Party of China (CPC) to unswervingly promote the building of a community of human destiny. For six consecutive years, the concept of building a community of human destiny has been written into the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and included in the documents of multilateral mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the BRICS, and has won wide recognition in the international community. Bilateral communities of destiny such as China-Laos, China-Pakistan, China-Cambodia, China-Thailand, China-Indonesia, China-Harbin, China-Uruguay, China-Turkey, China-Japan, China-Turkey, etc. have taken root; the construction of communities of destiny in the Asia-Pacific region, China-ASEAN, China-Central Asia, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Central Africa, China-Africa, China-Latin America, China-Pacific Island Countries, etc. is proceeding at a steady pace; initiatives for communities of destiny in cyberspace, nuclear security, and oceans and seas have been positively received by all countries; and a series of major propositions such as the Community of Life between Man and Nature A series of major propositions, such as the Community of Life of Man and Nature, the Community of Life on Earth, and so on, have gained wide support, and more and more countries and regions are joining in the chorus of building a community of destiny for mankind. It is encouraging to see that new practical achievements continue to emerge in promoting the building of a community of human destiny. Since the beginning of this year, from the successive release of the Concept Paper on Global Security Initiative, China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Crisis in Ukraine, and China's Position on Afghanistan, to the successful mediation of the ""Beijing Handshake"" between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the active promotion of the Middle East to usher in a ""wave of reconciliation"", China has taken the initiative to build a community of human destiny with the aim of building a ""community of human destiny"". ""With the long-term goal of building a community of human destiny, China has been actively practicing global security initiatives, exploring a new type of security path of dialogue rather than confrontation, partnership rather than alliance, and win-win rather than zero-sum, and contributing its wisdom and strength to the political settlement of hotspot issues. We have twice organized the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, deepened and expanded the BRICS+ model, and continuously improved the cooperation mechanisms among China-Africa, China-Africa, China-Latin America, China-Central and Eastern European countries, and China-Central Asian countries, etc. ... ...China firmly supports the vast number of developing countries, strives to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries in global affairs, and promotes the development of the global governance system in a more just and rational direction. Joaquim Chissano, former president of Mozambique, said the concept of building a community of human destiny unites the will of the world's people to seek unity and development, and ""demonstrates the CPC's open-mindedness and cooperation."" Mohammed al-Jubouri, professor of journalism at the University of Iraq, said that ""the concept of building a community of human destiny pursues solidarity, cooperation, mutual benefit and win-win situation and sustainable development"", which is in line with the needs of the international community. People-centered, Sharing Opportunities for Prosperity and Development This is the ninth year that Zhang Chao, a Chinese staff member, has been working on the construction of the Yavan high-speed rail project in Indonesia. His Indonesian colleagues once curiously asked him about the meaning of ""serving the people"" on the badge on his chest. Zhang Chao, who has been a Party member for 25 years, said, ""It means doing work that makes people feel happy and good,"" ""For example, the construction of the Yavan High Speed Railway is to make it convenient for people to travel. In a speech at the Moscow Institute of International Relations in Russia in the spring of 2013, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that countries and peoples should enjoy the fruits of development together. While pursuing its own development, each country should actively promote the common development of other countries. In the autumn of this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward the major initiative of building the ""Belt and Road"", building an open cooperation platform with a broad mind and a broad perspective to promote global connectivity. After ten years of cultivation, the Belt and Road has become an important practical platform for building a community of human destiny. In Ethiopia, the first modern all-Africa CDC has been built; in Nigeria, the first deep-water port in West Africa has been constructed; in Uzbekistan, the longest tunnel in Central Asia has been opened; and in the Maldives, the first cross-sea bridge has been built. ...... In the past ten years, the Belt and Road Initiative has attracted the attention of more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Over the past 10 years, the Belt and Road Initiative has attracted the participation of more than three-quarters of the world's countries and 32 international organizations, significantly enhanced global connectivity and trade, boosted investment of nearly one trillion U.S. dollars, created 420,000 jobs in countries along the routes, lifted nearly 40 million people out of poverty, and enhanced humanistic exchanges in different regions, making it a ""road to happiness"" that has benefited all countries and the world. ""Road to Happiness"". ""Important initiatives such as the joint construction of the 'Belt and Road' stem from China's deep understanding of the current situation and laws of human civilization development in the 21st century, and that countries should help each other and build a home together."" Anatoly Tozik, former deputy prime minister of Belarus, said. ""The Chinese have always advocated 'one world, one family'. The Chinese people not only wish well for themselves, but also wish well for the people of all countries."" In the face of severe challenges to global development in recent years, the CPC has put forward and practiced global development initiatives from the people-centered development idea, effectively forging an international consensus on promoting development together, and responding forcefully to global challenges and the development needs of the vast number of developing countries, which have been supported by more than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations. In June last year, General Secretary Xi Jinping hosted the High-Level Dialogue on Global Development in Beijing, proposing the creation of a development pattern of inclusive and balanced, coordinated and inclusive, win-win cooperation and common prosperity, and announcing that half of China's 32 important initiatives to implement the global development initiative have already been implemented or have achieved early results, which has been highly evaluated by all sides. ""We will listen to the people's voices, follow the trend of the times, promote greater coordination and cooperation among countries, unify the interests of our own people with those of the peoples of the world, and move forward toward building a community of human destiny."" The CPC, which has embarked on a new journey, is promoting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality development, providing new development opportunities for all countries. It has created a series of national-level ""exhibition matrices"" such as the Fair and the Consumer Expo, signed FTAs with at least 27 countries and regions, coordinated and promoted the construction of 21 pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port, pushed forward the high-level implementation of the Agreement on Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and applied for membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Agreement ...... Over the past decade, China's average contribution to world economic growth has exceeded 30 percent, and it has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions. The recently concluded 14th Annual Meeting of New Leaders of the World Economic Forum (Summer Davos Forum) attracted about 1,500 participants, half of whom came from overseas, with foreigners hoping to learn more about China and develop their business. Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, said, ""The whole world has benefited from China's development"". Using civilization as a torch to illuminate the direction of mankind's forward movement ""Today, when the future and destiny of all countries are closely linked, the tolerance and coexistence of different civilizations, exchanges and mutual learning have an irreplaceable role in promoting the modernization process of the human society and the prosperity of the world's hundred gardens of civilization."" In March this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward the Global Civilization Initiative at the High-level Dialogue between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the World Political Parties, further enriching and expanding the practical path of building a community of human destiny. The inclusiveness of Chinese civilization determines the openness of Chinese culture to the world's civilizations. The Global Civilization Initiative, which advocates respecting the diversity of world civilizations, promoting the common values of all humankind, emphasizing civilizational inheritance and innovation, and strengthening international humanistic exchanges and cooperation, is another important public product that China will provide to the international community in the new era. To resolve the outstanding contradictions and problems faced by mankind, it is necessary to rely on material means to overcome difficulties, as well as on the power of the spirit to be sincere and correct. From hosting international conferences such as the Dialogue among Asian Civilizations, the High-level Dialogue between the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties, and the General Assembly of the Asian Cultural Heritage Conservation Union, to co-hosting the ""Year of Cultural Exchanges"" with a number of countries, and carrying out activities such as the translation of classic works and joint archaeological activities, China in this new era has always been the advocate, practitioner, and promoter of civilization exchanges and mutual understanding. According to an article on the website of Mexico's Millennium newspaper, China has defended the argument of equality of civilizations, emphasizing the value of understanding different civilizations with a broad mind. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Promoting the building of a community of human destiny is not replacing one system with another, or replacing one civilization with another, but rather, countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories and cultures, and levels of development should coexist in international affairs, share rights and responsibilities, and form the greatest common denominator."" All things exist side by side without harming each other, and the Dao runs in parallel without contradicting each other. The concept of building a community of human destiny advocates upholding equality and respect, abandoning arrogance and prejudice, building more bridges across civilizational barriers, promoting people from all countries to know each other and be close to each other, and working together to build a homeland of the Earth where human beings live in harmony with nature, the economy and the environment synergize, and all countries of the world develop together. Former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said that the concept of building a community of human destiny is ""an inevitable choice for the forward development of human civilization"". Surabh Gupta, a senior researcher at the Center for China-U.S. Studies in the U.S., believes that China does not impose its values on others, but advocates tolerance and mutual understanding, and moving forward together, which is of great significance to world peace and development. We share the same destiny and walk the road, and look to the future with the world in mind. The concept of building a community of human destiny profoundly interprets the true meaning of peace and development, reflects the common voices of people from all countries, and exudes the charm of thought that transcends space and time, which will surely gather more and more consensus and push the human society toward a bright future. (Participating reporters: Yu Qianliang, Yao Bing, Shen Danlin, Liu Kai and Guan Jianwu) (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 4)","The article highlights the significance of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in promoting the building of a community of human destiny. It mentions how the CPC, with the理念 of building a community of human destiny, has been working hand in hand with all parties and contributing Chinese wisdom, Chinese programs, and Chinese power to solving major problems of mankind and building a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness and inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty.

【理响中国】调查研究的方法论遵循 来源：人民网-理论频道 作者：何毅 祝建华 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2023-07-03 15:26:21 0,调查研究是我们党的传家宝。近日，《关于在全党大兴调查研究的工作方案》印发，强调大兴调查研究，推进开好局起好步，并明确提出了“必须坚持党的群众路线”“必须坚持实事求是”“必须坚持问题导向”“必须坚持攻坚克难”“必须坚持系统观念”的总体要求，以方法论视角对开展调查研究工作作出了系统总结，为全党大兴调查研究、做好当前工作、谋划未来发展提供了重要指引和有力部署。 走群众路线是调查研究的根本方法 人民群众是智慧和力量的主体，也是社会的主体，调查研究必须坚持党的群众路线。群众路线既是党的根本工作路线，也是开展调查研究的首要遵循。脱离群众是我们党的最大危险，也是调查研究失败的祸源所在。党的科学决策一旦脱离群众，便会失去厚植沃土，成为无本之木；调查研究一旦脱离群众，便会失去源头活水，成为无稽之谈。人民是历史的创造者，也是历史的推动者，尊重人民主体地位，就是调查研究必须牢牢把握党的群众路线，从群众中来、到群众中去、最终回到群众中。调查研究的起始过程正是以人民群众为对象贯穿全程。“从群众中来”是调查研究的主体依据，而“到群众中去”正是调查实践的切实要求，“回到群众中”则是研究成果的落脚点。可以说，调查研究的实践过程就是贯彻党的群众路线的践行化。“人民群众中蕴藏着丰富的智慧和力量”，调查研究必须坚持走好群众路线，深入群众、深入基层，获取第一手资料，为科学决策提供现实参考。 实事求是是调查研究的根本原则 坚持实事求是是共产党人开展一切工作的根本原则，要开展调查研究，就必须坚持实事求是原则。作为毛泽东思想活的灵魂，在《改造我们的学习》一文中对实事求是进行了哲学解释，指出：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”即从实际出发，对客观事物进行研究进而探寻其蕴藏的内在规律。关于调查研究的定义，即“对客观实际情况的调查了解和分析研究，目的是把事情的真相和全貌调查清楚，把问题的本质和规律把握准确，把解决问题的思路和对策研究透彻”。由此可见，调查研究与实事求是不谋而合，实事求是离不开调查研究，同样调查研究也必须坚持实事求是。调查研究与实事求是紧密结合、不可脱离，一旦偏废便会导致决策的失败，这是由中国共产党调查研究的历史经验所证明的。调查研究的目的在于解决问题，而是否实事求是地反映实情则很大程度决定着其目的能否实现。“调查研究必须坚持实事求是的原则，树立求真务实的作风，具有追求真理、修正错误的勇气。”实事求是作为认识世界、揭示真理的正确途径，是调查研究的必然要求。实事求是为调查研究保障真实性，只有坚持实事求是，才能在纷繁复杂事物表象中以现实的立足点展开研究，进而揭示事物的客观本质和规律，保证调查研究的真实有效性。 问题导向是调查研究的方向引领 问题是前进的动力，是时代的呼声，调查研究必须坚持问题导向。没有鲜明的问题导向，调查研究就犹如没有了头颅的苍蝇，没有了靶心的弓箭。回顾百年征程，中国共产党的发展史就是一部不断调查研究的实践史，也是一部具有鲜明问题导向、不断破解中国现实问题的探索史。我们党在制定重大决策、出台方针政策之前，都会以问题为导向深入调查研究，获取第一手资料。衡量调查研究好不好，不在于调查时长、更不在于报告页数，而是看调查研究的成果能否切实解决问题。新征程的道路上，新矛盾、新问题层出不穷，在复杂多变的客观表象中做出正确判断和科学决策，要求我们在唯物辩证法的指导下，坚持问题导向，具体问题具体分析，继续深入调查研究。 攻坚克难是调查研究的意志推力 困难是走向成熟的台阶，越是艰难越向前，调查研究必须坚持攻坚克难。辩证唯物主义揭示，矛盾是普遍存在的，同时道路的曲折又是与前途的光明是辩证统一的。调查研究路上的困难与挫折是研究成果诞生前的“磨刀石”，淬炼调查研究直插问题的“刀刃”。历史经验反复证明，行百里者半九十，越是在最吃劲的时候，越要有一鼓作气的决心，越要有攻坚克难的毅力。随着调查研究的深入，所浮现的困难挑战越是艰险，这并非是要半途而废，而是距离调查研究的结果越近，越不能懈怠，越要加倍努力，越要保持攻坚克难的决心毅力。“伟大梦想不是等得来、喊得来的，而是拼出来、干出来的。”当今世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，国际形势错综复杂，各种风险挑战、困难问题比以往更加严峻复杂，迫切要求发扬攻坚克难、斗争精神深入开展调查研究工作以把握事物的本质和规律，探寻解决问题的路径和办法。“要做起而行之的行动者、不做坐而论道的清谈客，当攻坚克难的奋斗者、不当怕见风雨的泥菩萨。”这深刻告诫我们调查研究要深入基层，敢于破险关、过难关，直面各种风险挑战，以坚毅的决心，深入问题一线，获取调查研究成果。以攻坚克难之决心破解现实难题、化解事物矛盾、啃掉“硬骨头”，开拓出一条调查研究的“星光大道”。 系统观念是调查研究的基本遵循 系统观念是具有基础性的思想和工作方法，调查研究必须坚持系统观念。万事万物之间是普遍联系、相互作用的，只有用联系发展的观点观察事物，才能把握事物的规律，这是辩证唯物主义所揭示的客观真理，要求调查研究必须全面、客观且准确。调查研究是我们认识世界、解决问题的重要途径。调查研究的对象内容是否全面系统、手段方法是否客观实际、数据信息是否准确真实，决定了客观事物的认识情况以及问题的解决程度。坚持系统观念推进调查研究，就是要对调查研究进行前瞻性思考、全局性谋划以及整体性推进。前瞻性思考要求调查研究自觉放弃狭隘思维，把眼光放长远，从理论的高度、历史的深度、实践的广度中准确把握客观事物的发展变化，牢牢把握调查研究的主动权；全局性谋划要求调查研究不能静止孤立地看待问题，要放开眼界、开阔视野，把问题放在纵横交错的交叉点上观察研究，既注重横向社会调查，又注重纵向历史研究，多角度全方位获取第一手素材；整体性推进要求调查研究杜绝以偏概全，要从整体和全局出发调查、分析和研究问题，统筹兼顾、协调推进，充分发挥调查研究所有要素的功能效果，保证材料的全面客观真实。坚持系统观念，将调查研究第一手资料去伪存真、去粗取精，从感性认识上升到理性认识，以解决现实问题。 调查研究是谋事之基、成事之道，是我们党的传家宝。在新时代，要深刻领悟调查研究的重要价值，牢牢把握调查研究工作的总体要求，推进调查研究深入基层一线、问需问计于民，推动党中央大政方针和决策部署落地生根，推进中国特色社会主义不断从胜利走向胜利。 （作者：何毅，四川师范大学马克思主义学院教授、博士生导师；祝建华，四川师范大学马克思主义学院马克思主义理论研究中心研究助理）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230705234822/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16234725.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230703074306/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16234725.html,2023-07-06 0:00:00,[Reasoning China] The Methodology of Survey Research Source: People's Daily Online - Theory Channel Author: He Yi Zhu Jianhua Editor-in-Chief: Guo Yanfei 2023-07-03 15:26:21 0,"Investigation and research is our party's heirloom. Recently, the Work Program on Investigative Research in the Party as a Whole was issued, emphasizing the importance of investigative research to promote a good start, and clearly put forward the general requirements of ""must adhere to the mass line of the Party"", ""must adhere to seeking truth from facts"", ""must adhere to problem orientation"", ""must adhere to overcoming difficulties"" and ""must adhere to the systematic concept"" from a methodological point of view. ""must adhere to the problem-oriented"" ""must adhere to overcome difficulties"" ""must adhere to the systematic concept"" of the overall requirements, a methodological perspective on the conduct of investigation and research work has been systematically summarized It provides important guidance and strong deployment for the whole party to promote investigation and research, do a good job at present and plan for future development. Take the mass line is the fundamental method of investigation and research The people are the main body of wisdom and strength, but also the main body of society, investigation and research must adhere to the Party's mass line. The mass line is the fundamental working line of the party, but also the first line of investigation and research. Separation from the masses is the greatest danger to our party, but also the source of the bane of the failure of research. Once the party's scientific decision-making is detached from the masses, it will lose the fertile soil of thick planting, and become the wood of no origin; once the investigation and research is detached from the masses, it will lose the source of living water, and become nonsense. The people are the creators of history, but also the promoters of history, respect for the people's subjective position, that is, research must firmly grasp the party's mass line, from the masses, to the masses, and ultimately back to the masses. The starting process of investigation and research is to take the people as the object throughout the whole process. ""From the masses"" is the main basis of research, and ""to the masses"" is the practical requirements of the survey practice, ""back to the masses"" is the landing point of the research results. It can be said that the practical process of investigation and research is the practice of implementing the Party's mass line. ""The people are rich in wisdom and strength"", research must adhere to the mass line, in-depth masses, in-depth grassroots, to obtain first-hand information, for scientific decision-making to provide realistic reference. Seeking truth from facts is the fundamental principle of investigation and research Adhering to the principle of seeking truth from facts is the fundamental principle of all work carried out by communists. As the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought, the philosophical explanation of seeking truth from facts was given in the article ""Transforming Our Learning"", which pointed out that ""'truth' is everything that exists objectively, 'is' is the objective thing's internal connection, i.e., regularity, and 'seeking' is that we go and study."" That is to say, starting from the actual situation, we study the objective things and then search for the internal laws embedded in them. On the definition of investigation and research, that is, ""the investigation and understanding of the objective actual situation and analysis and research, the purpose is to investigate the truth and the whole picture of the matter, to grasp the essence of the problem and the law accurately, and to solve the problem of the ideas and countermeasures thoroughly."" It can be seen, research and seeking truth from facts coincide, seeking truth from facts can not be separated from research, the same research must also adhere to the seeking truth from facts. Investigation and research and seeking truth from facts are closely integrated, can not be separated, once the deviation will lead to the failure of decision-making, which is proved by the Communist Party of China's historical experience of investigation and research. The purpose of investigation and research is to solve problems, and whether or not to seek truth from facts to reflect the actual situation largely determines whether its purpose can be realized. ""Investigation and research must adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, establish a style of truth-seeking and pragmatism, and have the courage to pursue truth and correct errors."" Seeking truth from facts as the correct way to know the world and reveal the truth is the inevitable requirement of investigation and research. Seek truth from facts to guarantee the authenticity of the survey research, only adhere to seek truth from facts, in order to be in the complexity of things in the appearance of the reality of the foothold to carry out research, and then reveal the objective nature of things and the law, to ensure that the survey research of the real effectiveness. Problem-oriented is the direction of survey research to lead the problem is the driving force of progress, is the voice of the times, survey research must adhere to the problem-oriented. Without a clear problem orientation, research is like a fly without a skull, without a bull's-eye bow and arrow. Looking back on the century-long journey, the history of the development of the CPC is a practical history of continuous investigation and research, as well as a history of exploration with a distinctive problem orientation, constantly cracking the realities of China. Before making major decisions and introducing policies, the CPC conducts problem-oriented in-depth surveys and researches to obtain first-hand information. To measure whether a survey is good or not, it does not depend on the length of the survey or the number of pages in the report, but whether the results of the survey can actually solve the problems. On the road to a new journey, new contradictions, new problems are emerging, in the complex and changing objective appearances to make correct judgments and scientific decision-making, requires us to adhere to the guidance of material dialectics, problem-oriented, specific analysis of specific problems, continue to conduct in-depth investigations and research. Tackling difficulties is the will thrust of investigation and research Difficulties are the steps to maturity, the more difficult the more forward, investigation and research must adhere to tackling difficulties. Dialectical materialism reveals that contradictions are prevalent, while the twists and turns of the road is dialectically unified with the brightness of the future. Investigation and research on the road of difficulties and setbacks is the birth of research results before the ""whetstone"", quenching the investigation and research directly into the problem of the ""blade"". Historical experience has repeatedly proved that the line is half ninety, the more in the most strenuous time, the more we must have a drum of determination, the more we must have the perseverance to overcome the difficulties. With the depth of the investigation and research, the difficulties and challenges surfaced the more arduous, it is not to give up halfway, but the closer to the results of the investigation and research, the more we can not slacken off, the more we have to redouble our efforts, the more we have to maintain the determination of the determination to overcome the difficulties of perseverance. ""The great dream is not to wait and shout, but to spell out and do."" Today's world a century of unprecedented changes accelerated evolution, the international situation is intricate and complex, a variety of risks and challenges, difficulties and problems are more serious and complex than ever before, the urgent need to carry forward the spirit of the attack, the spirit of the struggle to carry out in-depth investigation and research work to grasp the essence of the matter and the law, and to explore the solution to the problem of the path and the way. ""To be up and do the action, do not sit and talk about the talkers, when the struggle to overcome the difficulties, not afraid to see the wind and rain of the clay Bodhisattva."" This profoundly admonished us to investigate the research to go deep into the grassroots, dare to break the danger, over the difficulty, and face up to the various risks and challenges, with perseverance and determination, in-depth problems of the front line, to obtain the results of the investigation and research. With the determination to overcome the difficulties of cracking the reality of the problem, resolve the contradictions, gnawing off the ""hard bones"", to open up a ""starry road"" of research. Systematic concept is the basic research follow Systematic concept is a fundamental thinking and working method, research must adhere to the systematic concept. Everything is universally linked, interaction, only with the linkage of the development point of view to observe things, in order to grasp the law of things, which is the objective truth revealed by dialectical materialism, requires research must be comprehensive, objective and accurate. Research is an important way to understand the world and solve problems. Whether the content of the object of investigation and research is comprehensive and systematic, whether the means and methods are objective and practical, whether the data and information are accurate and true, determines the understanding of objective things and the degree of problem solving. Adhere to the systematic concept to promote research, is to carry out forward-looking thinking, global planning and overall promotion of research. Forward-looking thinking requires research to consciously give up narrow thinking, the vision of the long term, from the height of theory, historical depth, the breadth of practice to accurately grasp the development of objective things, firmly grasp the initiative of research; global planning requires research can not be static and isolated view of the problem, we must liberalize the eye, broaden the horizons of the problem in the vertical and horizontal intersection of the observation of the research, focusing on both horizontal social surveys, but also focusing on vertical and horizontal social surveys, and also focusing on the overall promotion of research. Horizontal social surveys, but also pay attention to vertical historical research, multi-angle and all-round access to first-hand materials; holistic promotion requires investigation and research to put an end to bias, to investigate, analyze and study the problem from the whole and the overall situation, taking into account the overall situation and coordinating the promotion of all elements of the investigation and research to give full play to all the elements of the function of the effect of the investigation and research to ensure that the materials of the comprehensive, objective and truthful. Adhere to the systematic concept, will investigate and research first-hand information to remove the false and save the truth, remove the rough and extract the essence, from perceptual understanding to rational understanding, in order to solve the real problem. Investigation and research is the foundation of planning, the way to success, is our party's heirloom. In the new era, we should deeply understand the important value of investigation and research, firmly grasp the overall requirements of investigation and research work, promote investigation and research in-depth grass-roots front-line, ask for the needs of the people, to promote the Party Central Committee's major policies and decision-making and deployment of the roots, and to promote the socialism with Chinese characteristics continue to go from victory to victory.

It explains that good survey research must adhere to the following principles: 1) mass line - reflecting that the people are the main strength and target of investigation and research; 2) seeking truth from facts - emphasizing the importance of truth, fact, and objective reality; 3) problem orientation - ensuring that research focuses on identifying problems and seeking solutions; 4) tackling difficulties - acknowledging the challenges that may be encountered during research and the need to overcome them; and 5) systematic concept - recognizing that investigation and research should be comprehensive, objective, and accurate. The article emphasizes the need to conduct research thoroughly and deeply, even in the face of difficulties, in order to produce accurate results that can inform effective decision-making. Finally, the article notes that investigation and research is a valuable asset for the CCP and is a key factor in the Party's success."

""Learning ideas"" is a dynamic development process with the times, we must do to follow up on the learning, cognitively follow, action to follow, the latest important speeches of President Xi and the spirit of the important instructions and criticism should be the first time to learn to understand, combined with the new reality of their own into the duties into the job into the work into the learning of thought and use of coherent, knowledge, belief and behavior unity, and constantly promote the In order to realize the unity of learning, thinking and application, we should constantly promote the study and implementation of the deeper, more practical and more heartfelt. ""Learning ideas"" focuses on solving the problem of ""learning to transform people"" Marxist faith is the lifeblood and soul of communists. Marxist style of learning focuses on the Party's innovative theories, ""Learning Ideas"" focuses on solving the problem of ""learning to transform people"", educating and guiding the majority of Party members and cadres to the theoretical study and refinement of ideas, washing the spirit of unity, and firm ideals, refinement of the party's character, combined from the ideological correctness of the mind. Combined, really from the ideological source, solid root, focusing on the heart and soul, learning to transform people on the efforts to see results. Learn the character of loyalty. Loyalty to the party is the primary political character of party members and cadres. To learn the character of loyalty, we must consciously internalize Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era in our hearts and minds and externalize it in our actions, firmly believe in Marxism, believe in socialism with Chinese characteristics, have faith in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, consciously adhere to the Party's all-round leadership, firmly safeguard the authority of the Central Committee of the CPC and centralized unity of the leadership, and always love the Party with all our hearts and minds, always worry about the Party, protect the Party with all our strength and make every effort to promote the Party. The Party, to ensure that at any time under any circumstances are absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, absolutely reliable. Learning to serve the people. Seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation is the original mission of the CPC, reflecting the Party's broad sentiment of serving the people. Adhering to the supremacy of the people is a red line running through Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. ""Learning the ideology"" must deeply understand the people-centered development ideology embedded in this ideology, grasp the consistency between the party nature and the people's nature, clarify the fundamental question of ""who am I, who am I for, and who am I relying on"", strengthen the sense of purpose, and practice the mass line, and always maintain a close relationship with the people. Always maintain the same breath with the people, share the same fate, heart to heart of the true feelings, and effectively realize, safeguard and develop the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people as the starting point and finishing point of all work, and strive to create a better and happier life for the people. Learn to have excellent skills. Learning the theory is the cornerstone of strengthening the skills, mastering the method is the key to enhance the skills. To acquire excellent skills, we must deeply grasp the worldview and methodology of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, adhere to and utilize the position and viewpoints and methods that run through it, realize the laws, make clear the direction, learn the methods, and increase the wisdom, and in particular, we must master the leadership methods, ideological methods, and working methods contained therein, so as to truly learn the skills of watching over the family, developing the Party, and strengthening the country, and to apply them throughout the entire process of thinking and doing things. Thinking and doing things in the whole process, and effectively improve the political, thinking and practical ability to cope with major challenges, resist major risks, overcome major resistance, resolve major conflicts and solve major problems, and constantly create a new situation for the work. Learn to be righteous. Integrity is the bottom of the man, is the necessary integrity of the Communist Party. Learning to be righteous, we must in this theme of education, educate the majority of party members and cadres to highlight the problem-oriented, check the shortcomings, find gaps, clear direction, accept the political physical examination, clean up the political dust, correct the behavioral deviations, to solve the ideological impurity, the organization of impure aspects of the outstanding problems, and constantly enhance the party's self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal, self-improvement ability, and strive to nourish the vigorous vitality of the communists, The spirit of struggle is the most important manifestation of the spirit of the Communist Party. The spirit of struggle can best reveal the righteousness of the communists, we must enhance the ambition, backbone, bottom, do not believe in evil, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of pressure, to maintain the enterprising, dare to be the first, rise to the challenge of the struggle, dare to struggle, good at struggle, and effectively rely on the tenacious struggle to open up the cause of the development of a new world. The key to solving the problem of ""learning by doing"" is to ""learn by doing"". Practicality is a distinctive feature of Marxism. Insisting on the unity of knowledge and practice, learning to apply, embodies the Party's consistent requirements of combining knowledge and practice, linking theory and practice, and unifying the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world. The purpose of ""learning ideas"" lies in the application, we must vigorously carry forward the Marxist style of linking theory with practice, correctly deal with the relationship between learning and using, knowing and doing, thinking and doing, and find the combination point and focus of the implementation of the real effectiveness of learning into a powerful force to guide the practice and promote the work. Transform into realize the goal, promote the development of ideas and initiatives. Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has profoundly revealed our party's scientific understanding of the law of communist party rule, the law of socialist construction, and the law of development of human society, and has provided a treasure trove of ideas and a source of strength for the construction of a strong nation and national rejuvenation. The key to ""learning ideas"" is to see whether the scientific worldview and methodology can be transformed into clear ideas, correct methods and innovative initiatives to promote high-quality development. Party members and cadres should be good at ""learning ideas"" to draw wisdom and strength, good at learning the Party's scientific theories to find direction, confidence, solutions and answers, good at combining the top and bottom of the situation, the unity of commonality and individuality in the exploration of paths and methods, and constantly improve the systematic concepts of thinking, work, and development of thinking and thinking ability. The company's management team has been working hard to improve the quality of its products and services. Transformed into a vivid practice of overcoming difficulties and cracking problems. Cracking problems in reform, development and stabilization with the spirit of attacking difficulties is the distinctive style of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Party members and cadres are the backbone of the party's cause, in the face of wind and rain dare to overcome difficulties, crack the problem, is not only an important manifestation of their own political qualities, but also to support the party's cause of the big tree standing. ""Learning ideas"" must be learned from the courage to overcome difficulties in the determination of confidence, wisdom, ways and means, and constantly improve the ability to resolve conflicts, crack the problem and level. To deepen the investigation and research, identify bottlenecks that constrain the construction and development, research and validate the decision-making countermeasures, the courage to face the contradictions, rise to the challenge, dare to gnaw on the hard bones, dare to wade through the dangerous shoals, with the ""biting the green hills do not let go"" tenacity and ""not broken the end of Lan Lan"" of the hard work! Crack the problem, do not let up until the problem is solved, do not let go until the solution is complete. Translated into fulfillment of their duties and responsibilities, to establish new achievements in the actual results. ""For the learning of reality, solid in practice."" Test party members and cadres ""learning ideas"" of the actual effectiveness of the final look at their own work and the completion of various tasks. In the construction of a strong country, the new journey of national rejuvenation, the majority of Party members and cadres should have a ""big country"", consciously integrate their personal ideals into the cause of the Party and the people, their positions as a platform for what they are doing as the center of the love and dedication to duty, dedication and commitment, take on the role of, and strive to create outstanding, colorful, outstanding work performance.

军事论坛丨透视智能化战场软件建设 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：常书杰  张双喜  蔺向阳 责任编辑：尚晓敏 2023-07-06 07:34:06 0,透视智能化战场软件建设 ■常书杰  张双喜  蔺向阳 引言 人工智能技术的日益成熟，正推动人类社会逐步迈入智能化社会，智能化战争应运而生。无人智能作战是智能化战争的重要作战形式，软件系统的先进性、适应性、灵活性直接决定着无人智能作战力量的“聪明”程度。当前，世界主要军事强国均关注软件对无人智能作战的重要作用，加快构建无人系统软件生态体系，从而谋求占据无人智能作战力量建设发展的战略高地。 ●认清战争发展趋势—— 立起无人智能作战“软件不软”的主流认知 无人智能作战需要软件对硬件进行优化升级和赋能增效。若作为无人系统“大脑”的配套软件落后，其硬件性能再高都只是“虚高”。由此可讲，软件不软。 软件是战术思想物化的载体。人工智能的军事化应用通常以软件形态存在，其自身不能直接作用于武器系统，必须附着于算法、数据、模型等载体，以软件形式进行充分虚拟物化。无人智能作战，人不再是交战的主要执行者，不再以战场前沿对抗力量的形式存在，而是更多地居身于后台，并将作战谋略与战术思想，以智能算法、作战模型、交战规则等形式预置到无人系统中，由其自主贯彻执行人的作战意图，以此达成预定作战目的。可见，无人智能作战仍然是人的作战意志的展现，离不开以软件为载体的预先规划与行动设计。 软件是机器自主运行的基础。没有先进软件的驱动，无人系统便只是机器。软件是计算机解决问题所使用的清晰指令和策略机制，本质上是用计算机语言抽象、提炼、转换的数理公式，能够“告诉”无人系统该怎么做，赋予其“独立”遂行任务的能力。在机器学习技术的支撑下，无人系统拥有更加强大的持续迭代升级能力，能够模拟人类感知等行为，支持自主观察、判断、决策与行动。在复杂的战场环境中，软件是无人智能作战发展的底层逻辑，是无人智能战斗力生成的基础。 软件是系统持续升级的抓手。传统作战体系中，装备发展往往是“一次定型、终身使用”，迭代升级通常只能按代际或改进型号来进行。这种阶跃式的间断进步，操作流程繁琐、耗时较长，未来将很难适应无人系统发展需求。从系统实现看，无人系统具有“平台通用、载荷互换、软件定义”的特性。其中，软件定义的本质是以软件快速更新与自我学习的方式，促进硬件功能的动态重构与提升。实践表明，软件以自学习、打补丁、升级包等形式持续优化，能够支持硬件系统全寿命周期内的能力提升“始终在路上”，不仅可以满足用户当前确定性作战需求，还能及时响应未来不断变化的作战需求。 ●扭住软件体系布局—— 构建上下兼容、便于定制的开放型软件生态 无人智能作战涉及平台杂、功能多、领域广，对软件的要求很高。根据需求特点，可将无人系统软件体系划分为智能操作系统根基层、数据算法模型核心层、作战应用软件交互层。 智能操作系统根基层。从技术演进趋势来看，无人系统的底层仍然是计算机系统，离不开智能操作系统的基础支持。回顾计算机发展历程，UNIX操作系统、开源Linux操作系统等都对计算机技术发展作出了突出贡献。未来战争，尤其是无人智能作战中需要创新设计底层操作系统，筑牢异构无人系统大规模协同运用与智能涌现的根基。外军认为，可面向作战任务、战场资源、交战行为的自主控制与管理，设计基于人工智能机器学习的操作系统框架，将作战应用的共性部分尽可能集成沉淀到操作系统层，支持数据、知识等无形资源的高效利用与硬件资源的虚拟化，为上层软件与用户提供便捷接口与友好环境。 数据算法模型核心层。数据、算法、模型是驱动无人系统智能生成的三大核心要素，是作战思想与交战规则嵌入无人系统的具体形式，有赖于基层智能操作系统提供的基础环境，支撑着交互层作战应用软件的智能化水平。智能化作战，需要围绕发现、识别、匹配、交战、评估等杀伤链关键环节，下大力破解作战数据生产使用难题；构建从需求生成到思路设计再到技术实现的全链条协同开发环境，支撑无人系统算法模型的快速便捷生成与高效迁移适配。 作战应用软件交互层。作战应用软件是作战人员与无人系统进行友好交互的重要媒介与窗口，支撑作战人员指令输入与无人系统信息反馈。技术机理上，作战应用软件安装部署于智能操作系统上，按照作战人员指令，按需调用对应算法与模型，以实现不同作战功能。类似于智能手机，配套网络与硬件相对稳定的情况下，就像海量的APP决定了手机各式各样的强大功能一样，无人智能作战涉及多个作战域，涵盖侦察、指控、打击、评估、作战保障等所有作战功能，作战应用软件创新的空间极为广阔。 ●拓新发展运用模式—— 以软件工厂、云上超市支撑“软件定义作战” 无人智能作战，软件的效能制约着战法的发挥。顺应趋势，应以无人智能作战需求侧为牵引，推进软件产品供给侧改革，创新软件开发、共享、部署的发展模式，支撑无人系统功能的持续在线优化，促进战法行动的快速“软件定义”，加快无人智能战斗力生成。 后台布局“软件工厂”。相比其他作战方式，无人智能作战在未来战争中具有较大优势。未来战争中无人智能作战将是优先用、全程用、大量用，对软件按需定制、批量开发、快速更新的需求将会与日俱增。外军认为，软件可快速获得的适应性是无人智能作战赢得优势的关键。实践中，可吸收借鉴商用软件开发的经验，在统一的软件开发生态与技术标准下，布局层次化、分布式软件工厂体系，支撑各类无人系统软件的快速持续开发和交付。 云上设立“软件超市”。从建设发展实践来看，军事领域相关软件基本采取定向服务、线下供给的模式，供需对接缺少平台，软件获取的开放性、便捷性不足。这种模式虽然可以满足机械化装备软硬件耦合要求，但很难适应无人系统快节奏软件更新需求。外军在建设实践中，借鉴智能手机软件“应用市场”模式，以数字认证、智能密钥等技术为防护，设立面向供需两端的无人系统“软件超市”，统筹承担软件验收上架、软件产品供给、软件质量管理等服务职能，支持授权厂家与用户的按需接入与线上交互，支持需求变化与软件升级的快速链接。此外，“软件超市”可采取灵活多样的形式提供软件开源开发环境，为部队软件工程师接续创新提供平台。 前端开展“软件定义”。从软件角度看，无人系统与智能手机类似，丰富的功能特征是由用户选择不同的APP“重新定义”赋予的。映射到装备上，智能手机可以视为无人系统，硬件与网络表现出极强的通用性，不同的APP就是面向不同作战任务部署的各类软件，支撑对应的载荷后产生多样化作战功能。未来无人智能作战，人的作用将向作战进程的始末两端转移。战前，指挥员面向作战场景定制软件服务，将作战任务、作战规则、约束条件等装载到无人系统；战后，收集分析数据，升级完善软件；战中，无人系统自主执行，仅需必要时介入干预。值得注意的是，作战人员不仅是软件产品的使用者，更是软件开发、升级需求的提报者，应主动学习、积极参与，为战术与技术的融合跨越提供智力支持。 编后 弓矢相济出战斗力 ■赵静轩 《胡非子》中有一个关于弓与箭的寓言。一人曰：“吾弓良，无所用矢。”一人曰：“吾矢善，无所用弓。”后羿闻之曰：“非弓，何以往矢？非矢，何以中的？”令合弓矢，而教之射。 由智能化战场的软硬件话题想到这个寓言，我们可以从中得到启示：事物总是相互依赖、相辅相成的，各部分协调配合才能充分发挥各自特长，进而形成合力。如果将它们孤立起来，就会影响各自作用的发挥。 智能化作战即是如此，一方面，以作战平台、弹药等物理实体为代表的硬件仍然是战斗力的重要组成部分。缺乏硬件作为载体，软件的“赋能增效”便失去了对象。另一方面，软件是智能化武器系统的“灵魂”。如果软件落后，武器装备硬件性能指标再高都只是“虚高”，实战中很难发挥作战效能。基于这一认识，智能化建设中应改变“重硬轻软”的理念，将软件建设作为未来作战力量建设的一个重点，硬件与软件协同发展，实现战斗力整体质的跃升。,https://web.archive.org/web/20230709001229/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16235302.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230706032200/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16235302.html,2023-07-09 0:00:00,军事论坛丨透视智能化战场软件建设 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：常书杰 张双喜蔺向阳 责任编辑：尚晓敏 2023-07-06 07:34:06 0,"Intelligent battlefield software construction ■ Chang Shujie Zhang Shuangxi Lin Xiangyang Introduction The increasing maturity of artificial intelligence technology is promoting human society to gradually enter the intelligent society, intelligent war should come into being. Unmanned intelligent warfare is an important form of intelligent warfare, the advanced nature of the software system, adaptability, flexibility directly determines the degree of unmanned intelligent combat forces ""smart"". At present, the world's major military powers are concerned about the important role of software in unmanned intelligent warfare, accelerating the construction of an unmanned system software ecosystem, thus seeking to occupy the strategic high ground of unmanned intelligent warfare force construction and development. Recognize the development trend of war - establish the mainstream cognition that unmanned intelligent combat ""software is not soft"" Unmanned intelligent combat requires software to optimize and upgrade the hardware and empower the efficiency. If the supporting software as the ""brain"" of the unmanned system lags behind, the high performance of the hardware is only a ""false high"". It can be said that software is not soft. Software is the carrier of the materialization of tactical thinking. The militarization of artificial intelligence applications usually exist in the form of software, which can not act directly on the weapon system, must be attached to the algorithm, data, models and other carriers, in the form of software for the full virtual materialization. Unmanned intelligence combat, people are no longer the main executor of the battle, no longer in the form of battlefield frontier confrontation force, but more in the background, and combat strategy and tactical thinking, with intelligent algorithms, combat models, rules of engagement and other forms of pre-positioned to the unmanned system, by its independent implementation of human combat intentions, in order to achieve the intended purpose of the battle. It can be seen that unmanned intelligent combat is still a display of human combat will, and cannot be separated from the pre-planning and action design with software as the carrier. Software is the basis for autonomous machine operation. Without the drive of advanced software, unmanned systems are just machines. Software is a clear instruction and strategy mechanism used by computers to solve problems, which is essentially a mathematical formula abstracted, refined and converted in computer language, able to ""tell"" unmanned systems what to do, and give them the ability to ""independently"" attempt tasks. Under the support of machine learning technology, unmanned systems have more powerful continuous iterative upgrading capabilities, and can simulate human perception and other behaviors to support autonomous observation, judgment, decision-making and action. In the complex battlefield environment, software is the underlying logic of unmanned intelligent combat development, and is the foundation of unmanned intelligent combat force generation. Software is the grip of continuous upgrading of the system. In the traditional combat system, the development of equipment is often ""once finalized, lifelong use"", and iterative upgrading can usually only be carried out by generation or improved model. This kind of step-by-step intermittent progress, the operation process is cumbersome and time-consuming, and it will be difficult to adapt to the unmanned system development needs in the future. From the perspective of system realization, unmanned systems have the characteristics of ""platform universality, load interchangeability and software definition"". Among them, the essence of software definition is to promote the dynamic reconfiguration and enhancement of hardware functions by means of rapid software update and self-learning. Practice shows that the software to self-learning, patching, upgrade packages and other forms of continuous optimization, can support the hardware system life cycle of the ability to improve ""always on the road"", not only to meet the user's current deterministic operational needs, but also to respond to the future of the ever-changing operational needs. The layout of the software system is twisted to build an open software ecosystem that is compatible with the top and bottom and easy to customize. Unmanned intelligent combat involves a variety of platforms, functions, and fields, and the requirements for software are very high. According to the demand characteristics, the unmanned system software system can be divided into the root level of intelligent operating system, the core layer of data algorithm model, and the interactive layer of combat application software. Intelligent operating system root level. From the perspective of technology evolution trend, the bottom layer of unmanned system is still a computer system, which cannot be separated from the basic support of intelligent operating system. Looking back at the history of computer development, UNIX operating system, open source Linux operating system, etc. have made outstanding contributions to the development of computer technology. Future wars, especially unmanned intelligent combat, require innovative design of the underlying operating system to build a solid foundation for the large-scale collaborative use of heterogeneous unmanned systems and the emergence of intelligence. Foreign troops believe that the operating system framework based on artificial intelligence and machine learning can be designed for the autonomous control and management of combat tasks, battlefield resources and engagement behavior, integrating and depositing the common parts of combat applications into the operating system layer as much as possible, supporting the efficient use of intangible resources, such as data and knowledge, and the virtualization of hardware resources, and providing convenient interfaces and friendly environments for the upper-level software and users. Data algorithm model core layer. Data, algorithms and models are the three core elements driving the intelligent generation of unmanned systems, which are the specific forms of combat ideas and rules of engagement embedded in unmanned systems, relying on the basic environment provided by the grass-roots intelligent operating system to support the level of intelligence of the interactive layer of combat application software. Intelligent combat needs to focus on key aspects of the killing chain, such as discovery, identification, matching, engagement and evaluation, and make great efforts to crack the problem of production and use of combat data; build a collaborative development environment for the whole chain from demand generation to design of ideas to technical realization, and support the rapid and convenient generation of algorithmic models for unmanned systems and efficient migration and adaptation. Interaction layer of combat application software. Combat application software is an important medium and window for friendly interaction between combatants and unmanned systems, supporting the input of commands from combatants and feedback from unmanned systems. Technically, the combat application software is installed and deployed on the intelligent operating system, and calls corresponding algorithms and models according to the instructions of the combatants, so as to realize different combat functions. Similar to a smartphone, if the supporting network and hardware are relatively stable, just like a huge number of APPs determining the various powerful functions of a cell phone, unmanned intelligent combat involves multiple combat domains, covering all combat functions such as reconnaissance, accusation, strike, assessment, combat security, etc., and the space for innovation of combat application software is extremely broad. To expand the new development and application mode - to support ""software-defined combat"" with software factories and cloud supermarkets Unmanned Intelligent Combat, the efficacy of the software restricts the play of the method of warfare. In line with the trend, we should take the demand side of unmanned intelligent combat as a traction, promote the reform of the supply side of software products, innovate the development mode of software development, sharing and deployment, support the continuous online optimization of the function of unmanned systems, promote the rapid ""software definition"" of the method of operation, and accelerate the generation of unmanned intelligent combat power. Background layout ""software factory"". Compared with other combat methods, unmanned intelligent combat has a greater advantage in the future war. In the future war, unmanned intelligent combat will be a priority, the whole process, a large number of use, on-demand customization of software, batch development, rapid updating of the demand will increase day by day. Foreign armies believe that the adaptability of software that can be acquired quickly is the key to winning advantages in unmanned intelligent warfare. In practice, we can learn from the experience of commercial software development, in the unified software development ecology and technical standards, layout hierarchical, distributed software factory system, support all kinds of unmanned systems software rapid continuous development and delivery. Setting up a ""software supermarket"" on the cloud. From the viewpoint of construction and development practice, the software related to the military field basically adopts the mode of directional service and offline supply, with the lack of a platform for the docking of supply and demand, and the lack of openness and convenience in the acquisition of software. Although this model can meet the requirements of mechanized equipment software and hardware coupling, it is difficult to adapt to the unmanned system's fast-paced software updating needs. In the construction practice, the foreign army draws on the smartphone software ""application market"" mode, with digital authentication, intelligent key and other technologies as protection, and establishes an unmanned system ""software supermarket"" for the supply and demand sides, and undertakes the service functions such as software acceptance on the shelves, software product supply, software quality management, etc. to support the unmanned system, Software quality management and other service functions, to support the authorized manufacturers and users of on-demand access and online interaction, to support changes in demand and software upgrading of the rapid link. In addition, the ""Software Supermarket"" can adopt flexible and diverse forms to provide software open-source development environments, so as to provide a platform for software engineers of the army to continue innovation. Front-end ""software definition"". From a software perspective, unmanned systems are similar to smartphones, with rich functional characteristics given by users who choose different APPs to ""redefine"" them. Mapped to the equipment, the smartphone can be regarded as an unmanned system, the hardware and network show strong versatility, and different APPs are the various types of software deployed for different combat tasks, which support the corresponding payloads to generate diversified combat functions. In the future unmanned intelligent combat, the role of human will be transferred to the beginning and end of the combat process. Before the war, the commander customized software services for combat scenarios, combat tasks, combat rules, constraints, etc. loaded into the unmanned system; after the war, collect and analyze data, upgrade and improve the software; in the war, the unmanned system autonomously executed, only need to intervene in the intervention when necessary. It is worth noting that combatants are not only the users of software products, but also the submitters of software development and upgrading requirements, and should take the initiative to learn and actively participate in providing intellectual support for the integration of tactics and technology. Editorial Bow and arrow together out of combat ■ Zhao Jingxuan ""Hu Feizi"" has a fable about the bow and arrow. A man said, ""My bow is good, and I have no use for an arrow."" A man said, ""My bow is good, but I don't use my bow."" Hou Yi heard this and said, ""If it is not the bow, how can it go to the vector? If not the vector, how can I hit it?"" He made the bow and vector together, and taught them to shoot. By the intelligent battlefield hardware and software topics think of this fable, we can get inspiration from it: things are always interdependent, complementary, each part of the coordination in order to give full play to their respective strengths, and then form a synergy. If they are isolated, it will affect their respective roles to play. Intelligent combat is so, on the one hand, to combat platforms, ammunition and other physical entities represented by the hardware is still an important part of the combat power. Lack of hardware as a carrier, the software ""enabling efficiency"" will lose the object. On the other hand, software is the ""soul"" of intelligent weapon system. If the software is backward, the hardware performance indicators of weapons and equipment are only ""high"", it is difficult to play combat effectiveness in real combat. Based on this understanding, the intelligent construction should change the ""hard light soft"" concept, the software construction as a future focus of the construction of combat forces, hardware and software synergistic development, to achieve the combat effectiveness of the overall quality of the leap.","The article discusses the increasing maturity of artificial intelligence technology and how it is leading to the emergence of intelligent warfare, including the development of unmanned intelligent warfare. In this warfare, unmanned systems rely heavily on software, which is seen as the cornerstone for autonomous machine operation.

【时代青音】新时代党的创新理论大众化需要突出“新”的特征 来源：光明网 作者：邓莉 责任编辑：季鹏洋 2023-08-03 21:20:33 0,坚持理论创新，用党的创新理论武装全党、教育人民、指导实践，从而依靠人民推动党和国家事业发展，是我们党开辟事业发展新局面的重要法宝。新时代新征程，推进党的创新理论大众化，是巩固马克思主义在我国意识形态领域指导地位的重要举措，是不断谱写马克思主义中国化时代化新篇章的重要任务，也是我们党带领人民实现使命任务的内在要求。在新的历史形势下，实现党的创新理论大众化，必须充分凸显党的创新理论大众化“新”的特征。 新时代党的创新理论大众化要立足新思想、新内容 恩格斯指出，我们的理论“是一种历史的产物，它在不同的时代具有完全不同的形式，同时具有完全不同的内容。”党的创新理论总是对时代与实践的理论回应，是应对新挑战与实现新目标的科学方案，因此，在党和国家事业的不同历史阶段，既要持续推进马克思主义基本原理的普及教育，更要以与时俱进的创新理论武装人民的头脑。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是马克思主义中国化时代化的最新成果，是21世纪马克思主义，新时代党的创新理论大众化，首要的就是要使习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为人民广泛理解与认同、接受与运用。 新时代十年来，党的创新理论大众化取得了显著成效，党的二十大报告指出，“新时代党的创新理论深入人心”。在已经奠定的大好局面下，在新起点上继续推进党的创新理论大众化应有更高要求，必须走深走实。我们不能停留于对习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想进行一般性的宣传教育，只有讲清它在一脉相承的基础上对马克思主义思想的重要发展，彰显它的真理力量与实践伟力，才能使人们深刻理解并真心信服。 因此，我们应当有所侧重地宣传阐释党的创新理论：第一，讲清新时代与新课题、新思想与新论断，着重阐明习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的原创性理论贡献，充分展现其中国气派、时代特征。第二，讲清新举措与新实践、新成就与新变革，全面梳理理论飞跃基础上的实践飞跃。第三，讲清新体系与新视野、新高度与新境界，着重阐明习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想实现的规律性认识，及其蕴含的世界观和方法论，充分展现其体系化、学理化特点。 新时代推进党的创新理论大众化要适应大众的新特点、新要求 马克思指出：“理论只要说服人，就能掌握群众；而理论只要彻底，就能说服人。所谓彻底，就是抓住事物的根本。但人的根本就是人本身。”伴随历史与实践的进展，人的现实状况与需要不断变化发展，因此，党的创新理论要真正掌握群众，其思想内容和传播方式都必须紧密联系不断变化的大众。新时代推进党的创新理论大众化，就要把握大众的特点，适应大众的要求。 伴随着中国特色社会主义进入新时代，大众的基本状况发生了巨大变化。在大众的需要上，基本的物质文化需要已经得到一定满足，人民的美好生活需要越来越多、越来越高，并与不平衡不充分的发展形成了突出矛盾；在大众的构成上，各种新的社会阶层相继出现并持续演变；在大众的文化水平上，人们受教育程度普遍提高、文化层次显著提升，并有相当高的比例接受过马克思主义理论的普及教育；在思想观念上，利益多元、需求多样导致价值多元、思想多样，文化与意识形态领域形成错综复杂的局面。 面对大众，不能简单沿用过去的方式方法，而要有针对性地开展宣传工作：首先，要深入研究大众。切实把握不同群体的不同状况、不同需要、不同思想动向，开解其思想困惑、解决其实际困难，力争做到“对症下药”。其次，要充分发挥大众的主体作用。今天的大众不再是被动的教育、灌输对象，许多都是有知识、有理性、有能力的独立个体，只要给予正确引导，他们完全可以依托各种新兴媒体、通过多种方式，成为党的创新理论大众化的积极参与者和有力推动者。再次，要有重点、分层次地广泛推进党的创新理论大众化。不同群体的理论需要、理论水平和理论接受能力存在差异，要注重发挥党员干部的主导作用、青年学生的生力军作用，同时还要加大对其他人员的宣传力度，使党的创新理论最大程度、最大范围地被大众掌握。 新时代党的创新理论大众化要求理论工作者有新定位、新思路 习近平总书记指出：“新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义，需要大批能把马克思主义中国化讲好的人才，讲人民群众听得懂、听得进的话语，让党的创新理论‘飞入寻常百姓家。’”理论工作者是党的创新理论大众化的推动者、主力军，在传播党的创新理论的过程中，理论工作者如何自我定位是一个前提性问题。 党的创新理论大众化，从根本上是要使自身为大众所掌握，并转化为人民群众自觉的意识和行为，这是一个对理论从感性认知到理性认同，再将内化于心的思想外化为行动的过程。总体而言，理论工作者更多地在这一过程的第一阶段发挥作用，第二阶段则是在第一阶段的基础上主体自身的自觉转化。毋庸讳言，在以往的理论传播工作中，出现了一些值得注意的现象。比如，有些理论工作者建立了知识精英、理论权威的自我认知，产生了对大众进行灌输式宣教的路径依赖，形成了脱离实际的研究范式和远离大众的话语体系。新时代理论工作要承担好职责使命，就必须重新自我定位、形成新工作思路。 要使大众形成对党的创新理论的感性认知，就要做人民的时代同路人，与大众共情，激起大众的理论兴趣。古人云：“亲其人，信其道”。理论工作者要把自己的工作与党和国家事业紧密相联，既要进行精深的基础理论研究，又要使自己贴近实际、贴近生活、贴近群众，从人民的现实关切中寻找研究课题，把对现实的理论思考转化为人民的话语、生活的话语，努力做到“大专家讲家常话，让基本原理变成生动道理，让根本方法变成管用办法。” 要使大众形成对党的创新理论的理性认同，就要做人民平等的对话人，与大众共鸣，凝聚起大众的思想共识。在主体意识极大觉醒、思想文化极其多元的背景下，任何一种理论的传播都要进行与其他思想的理论竞争，任何一种理论都要经由大众的比较和评判，任何一种理论都不能理所当然地占据人民的思想阵地。理论工作者必须抛弃知识精英和理论权威的傲慢，抛弃高高在上的说教和晦涩的话语，把推动党的创新理论大众化视为与大众的平等对话，主动学习应用各种新平台、新载体，以多种形式与大众进行真诚的对话，在对话中力争说理透彻、以理服人。 总之，党的创新理论大众化必须适应新现实、实现新发展。党的二十大报告指出：“健全用党的创新理论武装全党、教育人民、指导实践工作体系。”新时代党的创新理论大众化，是一项具有许多新特点的系统工程，它要求我们不断地进行多角度、多层面的思考，继续探索更多新的有效路径。 作者：邓莉（中央党校（国家行政学院）哲学教研部副教授）,https://web.archive.org/web/20230805000020/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16242224.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230804101541/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16242224.html,2023-08-05 0:00:00,"[Times of Qingyin] The popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era needs to highlight the characteristics of ""new"" Source: Guangming.com Author: Deng Li Responsibility: Ji Pengyang 2023-08-03 21:20:33 0","Adhering to theoretical innovation, arming the whole Party with the Party's innovative theories, educating the people and guiding practice, thus relying on the people to promote the development of the Party and the country's undertakings, is an important magic weapon for the Party to open up new horizons in its career development. In the new era and new journey, promoting the popularization of the Party's innovative theories is an important initiative to consolidate the guiding position of Marxism in China's ideological field, an important task to continuously write a new chapter of the Chineseization of Marxism and its modernization, and an intrinsic requirement for the Party to lead the people to realize its mission and tasks. Under the new historical situation, to realize the popularization of the Party's innovative theories, it is necessary to fully highlight the ""new"" characteristics of the popularization of the Party's innovative theories. The popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era should be based on new ideas and new content Engels pointed out that our theory ""is a product of history, which has a completely different form in different times, and at the same time has a completely different content."" The Party's innovative theories are always theoretical responses to the times and practices, and are scientific solutions to new challenges and goals. Therefore, at different historical stages of the Party's and the country's undertakings, it is necessary to continue to promote popularization and education of the basic principles of Marxism, and more importantly, to arm the people's minds with the innovative theories that keep pace with the times. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest achievement of the Chineseization and modernization of Marxism, and it is 21st century Marxism. The first and foremost thing to do to popularize the Party's innovative theories in the new era is to make Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era broadly understood and agreed upon by the people, and accepted and applied by them. Over the past ten years of the new era, the popularization of the Party's innovative theories has achieved remarkable results, with the report of the 20th Party Congress stating that ""the Party's innovative theories of the new era have gained deep popularity."" Under the good situation that has been laid, continuing to promote the popularization of the Party's innovative theories from a new starting point should have higher requirements, and must go deeper and more practical. We cannot stop at general publicity and education on Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era; only by explaining its important development of Marxist thought on the basis of continuity, and by highlighting its power of truth and practice, can we make people profoundly understand and sincerely believe in it. Therefore, we should focus on publicizing and explaining the Party's innovative theories: firstly, we should talk about the new era and new issues, new ideas and new assertions, and emphasize the original theoretical contributions of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, so as to fully demonstrate its Chinese style and characteristics of the times. Second, the new initiatives, new practices, new achievements and new changes, and the practical leaps based on the theoretical leaps. Thirdly, we will talk about the new system and new vision, new heights and new realms, focusing on clarifying the regular understanding realized by Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, as well as the worldview and methodology it implies, and fully displaying its systematization and scholasticization characteristics. To promote the popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era, it is necessary to adapt to the new characteristics and requirements of the masses Marx pointed out, ""Theories can grasp the masses as long as they persuade people; and theories can persuade people as long as they are thorough. The so-called thoroughness is to grasp the fundamentals of things. But the root of man is man himself."" Along with the progress of history and practice, the real situation and needs of people are constantly changing and developing, therefore, for the Party's innovative theories to truly grasp the masses, their ideological content and dissemination methods must be closely linked to the ever-changing masses. To promote the popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era, it is necessary to grasp the characteristics of the masses and adapt to their requirements. Along with the entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the new era, the basic conditions of the masses have changed dramatically. In terms of the needs of the masses, the basic material and cultural needs have been satisfied to a certain extent, and the people's needs for a better life are becoming more and more numerous and higher, and have formed a prominent contradiction with unbalanced and inadequate development; in terms of the composition of the masses, various new social classes have emerged one after the other and continue to evolve; in terms of the cultural level of the masses, the people's education has generally improved, the cultural level has been significantly raised, and a fairly high percentage of them In terms of the cultural level of the masses, people's education level has generally improved and their cultural level has significantly increased, and a high proportion of them have received popular education in Marxist theory. In terms of ideological concepts, the plurality of interests and needs has led to the plurality of values and thoughts, and the formation of an intricate and complex situation in the cultural and ideological fields. In the face of the masses, we cannot simply follow the ways and means of the past, but must carry out our propaganda work in a targeted manner: first of all, we must study the masses in depth. First of all, we should study the public in depth. We should grasp the different conditions, needs and ideological trends of different groups of people, and try to solve their ideological puzzles and practical difficulties, so as to ""prescribe the right medicine for the right problem"". Secondly, we should give full play to the main role of the public. Today's public is no longer passive education, indoctrination object, many are knowledgeable, rational, capable of independent individuals, as long as the correct guidance, they can rely on a variety of emerging media, through a variety of ways, to become an active participant in the popularization of the Party's innovative theories and powerful promoters. Again, the popularization of the Party's innovative theories should be widely promoted in a focused and hierarchical manner. Different groups have different theoretical needs, theoretical levels and theoretical acceptance abilities, so we should focus on playing the leading role of party cadres, the role of young students as the driving force, and at the same time increase the publicity of other people, so that the Party's innovative theories can be grasped by the general public to the greatest extent and in the widest range. The popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era requires a new orientation and new ideas for theory workers General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""the new era of adherence to and development of socialism with Chinese characteristics requires a large number of talented people who can speak well about the Chineseization of Marxism, speak words that the people understand and listen to, and allow the Party's innovative theories to 'fly into the homes of ordinary people. '"" Theoretical workers are the promoters and main force of the popularization of the Party's innovative theories, and in the process of spreading the Party's innovative theories, how theoretical workers position themselves is a prerequisite issue. The popularization of the Party's innovative theories is fundamentally to make themselves grasped by the public and transformed into the conscious awareness and behavior of the people, which is a process of cognition of the theories from perceptual cognition to rational recognition, and then externalizing the internalized ideas into actions. Generally speaking, theorists play a role in the first stage of this process, and the second stage is the conscious transformation of the subject itself on the basis of the first stage. Needless to say, some noteworthy phenomena have appeared in the past work of theory dissemination. For example, some theoretical workers have established the self-perception of intellectual elites and theoretical authorities, generated a path dependence on indoctrination preaching to the public, and formed a research paradigm detached from reality and a discourse system far away from the public. In order to undertake the responsibility and mission of theory work in the new era, it is necessary to reposition oneself and form a new working idea. To enable the public to form a perceptual cognition of the Party's innovative theories, it is necessary to be the people's fellow traveler of the times, empathize with the public, and arouse the public's interest in theory. As the old saying goes: ""Pro his people, believe in the way"". Theoretical workers should closely link their work with the cause of the Party and the country, not only to carry out in-depth basic theoretical research, but also to make themselves close to the actual, close to life, close to the masses, from the people's concerns about the reality of the search for research topics, the theoretical reflection on the reality of the transformation of the people's discourse, the discourse of life, and strive to do ""big experts to talk about the common sense of life, so that the basic principles become We will endeavor to make ""big experts talk about common sense, so that basic principles can be transformed into vivid reasoning, and fundamental methods can be transformed into practical approaches."" In order to make the public form a rational recognition of the Party's innovative theories, it is necessary to be the people's equal interlocutor, resonate with the public, and gather the public's ideological consensus. Against the background of great awakening of subjective consciousness and extremely diversified ideologies and cultures, the dissemination of any kind of theory is subject to theoretical competition with other ideas, and any kind of theory is subject to comparison and judgment by the public, and any kind of theory cannot take for granted that it occupies the people's ideological positions. Theoretical workers must abandon the arrogance of intellectual elites and theoretical authorities, abandon lofty preaching and obscure words, regard the promotion of the popularization of the Party's innovative theories as an equal dialogue with the public, take the initiative to learn and apply various new platforms and carriers, and engage in sincere dialogues with the public in a variety of forms, and strive for thorough reasoning and convincing people with reason in the dialogues. In short, the popularization of the Party's innovative theories must adapt to new realities and achieve new development. The report of the 20th Party Congress points out, ""Improve the system of arming the whole Party with the Party's innovative theories, educating the people, and guiding practice."" The popularization of the Party's innovative theories in the new era is a systematic project with many new features, which requires us to constantly think from multiple angles and levels and continue to explore more new and effective paths. Author: Deng Li (Associate Professor, Department of Philosophy, Central Party School (National School of Administration))","The article highlights the importance of popularizing the Party's innovative theories in the new era, emphasizing the need to emphasize the ""new"" characteristics of the popularization. It suggests that the popularization should be based on new ideas and content, and that Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era should be widely understood and agreed upon by the people. The article also suggests that the popularization should adapt to the new characteristics and requirements of the masses, and that the orientation and ideas of the theory workers should be adjusted. It advocates for a targeted approach to propaganda work, emphasizing the importance of understanding the masses and giving full play to their main role. Finally, it acknowledges the need to adapt to new realities and achieve new development in the popularization of the Party's innovative theories, highlighting the need for continuous exploration of new and effective paths."

In the face of the complex and profound international situation and the arduous task of reform and development, if we can always maintain a strong strategic determination, accurate strategic judgment, strategic planning and scientific, strategic to win the initiative, the party and the people's cause will be very promising. Enhance the strategic strength, from the fundamental requirements, is to adhere to the scientific theory of Marxism guidance, the basic principles of Marxism with the concrete reality of China, with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, unswervingly take the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In terms of internal logic, maintaining strategic sobriety is a prerequisite, firm strategic self-confidence is the foundation, and grasping strategic initiative is the key. Maintaining strategic sobriety in adhering to the ""two combinations"" Adhering to the basic principles of Marxism combined with China's specific realities, combined with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, through which a red line is to adhere to the starting point of China's national conditions. The term ""national conditions"" has a rich meaning. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""to observe and understand China, both history and reality must be looked at"". Only by grasping China's history and reality in a comprehensive manner can we deeply recognize and understand China's national conditions. ""Unique cultural traditions, unique historical destiny, and unique national conditions have predestined China to inevitably follow a development path that suits its own characteristics."" The reason why the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is correct, and why it is a smooth road to creating a better life for the people and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, is not only because it adheres to socialism, but also because it adheres to the principle that everything starts from China's actual situation and is in line with China's national conditions. Now, some people are talking about this road or that road, some want to pull back to the old road, some want to lead to the evil road; some have a misunderstanding of the ideology, and some have ulterior motives. The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we see the right, determined, must unswervingly go on. We must always remain sober and firm, not be afraid of any risk, not be confused by any interference, and really do ""a thousand grinding ten thousand blows still strong, let the east and west, south and north winds"". At present, our country is still in the primary stage of socialism, which is the biggest national conditions, the biggest reality we face. To maintain strategic sobriety, we must firmly grasp the primary stage of socialism as the greatest national condition, firmly based on the primary stage of socialism as the greatest reality. On the one hand, we must see that after decades of theoretical and practical exploration, our understanding of socialism and our grasp of the laws of socialism with Chinese characteristics have reached a new and unprecedented height, which is indisputable. At the same time, we should also see that China's socialism is still in the primary stage, we are still facing a lot of unanswered questions and problems to be solved, and the understanding and handling of many major issues are still in the process of deepening, which is also indisputable. It takes a process to understand things, and our understanding and grasp of socialism, a new thing that has been practiced in China for only a few decades, is still very limited. Moreover, the more the cause develops and the deeper the reforms go, the more new situations and new problems there will be, the more risks and challenges we will face, and the more unpredictable things we will have to face. All this requires us to consistently combine the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture, to insist that practice is the only standard for testing truth, to insist on starting from the actual situation, to constantly answer the questions of China, the world, the people, and the times, to constantly enrich the practical, theoretical, national, and contemporary characteristics of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to make the Party and the country more and more successful under the new historical conditions. We will continue to enrich the practical, theoretical, national and contemporary features of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue to push forward the Party and the country's undertakings under the new historical conditions. Rongdong Area of Xiong'an New Area (Photo taken on March 24, 2023, drone photo). Xinhua News Agency reporter Mou Yu took the photo, insisting on the ""two combinations"" to strengthen strategic self-confidence Socialism with Chinese characteristics has been the theme of all the Party's theories and practices since the reform and opening up, and it is a fundamental achievement that the Party and the people have made through great hardships and at great cost. Firm strategic confidence means firm confidence in the road, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This kind of self-confidence does not fall from the sky, nor is it inherent in people's minds; self-confidence stems from successful practice. Since the day of its founding, our Party has written Marxism on its flag, led great practices with scientific theories, and continuously opened up the right path to save, build, prosper and strengthen the country. China has gone from being divided and scattered to being highly unified and united, from being poor and weak and penniless to being well-off, prosperous and strong, from being beaten and bullied to being independent and self-confident, and has completed in just a few decades the process of industrialization that developed countries have gone through in hundreds of years, and has created the two major miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Looking back on the Party's century-long struggle, we have come to realize more profoundly that to open up and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics on the basis of the profound foundation of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, and to combine the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with the excellent traditional Chinese culture is the way to go, and also the biggest magic weapon of our success. The ""two combinations"" not only lead to great practice, but also continuously lead to theoretical innovation. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest theoretical achievement of adhering to the ""two combinations"". This thought is a scientific theory that has been formed and constantly developed in the course of firmly promoting the great struggle with many new historical characteristics, and in the course of ushering in the great leap of the Chinese nation from standing up, becoming rich to becoming strong. It integrates the ideological essence of Marxism with the spiritual qualities of the Chinese outstanding traditional culture, and is full of rich Chinese flavor, profound Chinese sentiment and vast national soul, and is the contemporary Chinese Marxism and the 21st century Marxism. It is the Marxism of contemporary China, the Marxism of the 21st century, and the essence of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit of the times. The power of truth and the greatness of practice manifested by this thought further strengthens our ambition, backbone and bottomline of firm road confidence, theoretical confidence, institutional confidence and cultural confidence. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, standing on a vast land area of more than 9.6 million square kilometers, sucking in the cultural sustenance accumulated by the Chinese nation in its long struggle for more than 5,000 years, and possessing the majestic force of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people, we have an incomparably broad stage in the era of taking the road of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, an incomparably deep historical background, and an incomparably strong forward momentum. We have a broad stage of the times, a profound historical background, and a powerful force to move forward.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ying photographed Grasping the strategic initiative in adhering to the ""two combinations"" Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology for the founding of the Party and the rise of the Party and the country. The reason why the CPC is able and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good is that Marxism works, and it is Marxism that has been Chineseized and modernized. The ""two combinations"" reflect the CPC's profound grasp of the law of development of Marxism in the new era, and expand the connotation and ways of the Chineseization and modernization of Marxism. In particular, the ""two combinations"" have enabled us to take the initiative in ideology and culture, and have played a powerful role in roads, theories and systems, which will surely continue to expand the broad space for comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by means of Chinese-style modernization. On the one hand, we should base ourselves on the actual construction of a modernized socialist country in an all-round way, focus on the new problems encountered in practice, the deep-rooted problems of reform, development and stabilization, the urgent difficulties, sorrows and expectations of the people, the major problems in the international situation, and the outstanding problems facing the Party's construction, and make correct replies in line with the actual situation of China and the requirements of the times, come up with scientific understandings in line with the laws, and form the theoretical achievements that keep abreast of the times, so that they can better guide the practice of Chinese-style modernization. to guide the practice of Chinese-style modernization. On the other hand, from the point of view of digging deeper into the rich treasures of Chinese culture, we should insist on using the past for the present and promoting the new, linking the essence of Marxist thought with the essence of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and blending it with the common values that the people use every day without being aware of it, so as to fully stimulate the intrinsic vitality of Chinese culture, so as to make the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics have a broader and more far-reaching historical depth, and let Chinese civilization give Chinese-style modernization a deeper and richer foundation. Chinese civilization gives Chinese-style modernization a deep heritage. To seize the strategic initiative, we must attach great importance to the issue of strategic tactics. A correct strategy requires a correct tactic to implement it. To win the struggle on all fronts, we need not only strategic planning and firm fighting spirit, but also tactics, wisdom and methods. Strategy serves strategy under the guidance of strategy. Strategy and strategy is a dialectical unity of the relationship between the firmness of the strategy and the flexibility of the strategy combined, the position should be high, do things practically, not only to the direction, grasp the big things, planning for the long term, but also to grasp the work of the entry point and focus, not only to calculate the big account of the general account, but also to calculate the small account of the detailed account. If there is not enough strategic strength and tactical vitality, it is easy to lose ground, wavering, in and out of the problem, will miss the opportunity for development. Grasp the strategic initiative, but also need to carry forward the spirit of struggle. We must grasp the new historical characteristics of China's development, grasp the new strategic opportunities, new strategic tasks, new strategic stages, new strategic requirements, new strategic environment, play a good first move, fight the battle of the initiative, do not believe in evil, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of pressure, know the difficulties, meet the difficulties, and make every effort to overcome all kinds of difficulties and challenges on the way forward, relying on the tenacity of the struggle to open up the cause of a new world of development. Believe in scientific truth and tread on the right path. At present, we are engaged in a great cause that has never been seen before. Facing the future, as long as we can maintain a strong strategic determination, insist on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities, combining them with China's excellent traditional culture, better unifying the adherence to Marxism and the development of Marxism, and insisting on using the ""vector"" of Marxism to shoot the ""yes"" of the new era of China, we will be able to achieve the goals of the new era of China's development. If we insist on using the ""vector"" of Marxism to shoot the ""vector"" of China in the new era, we will surely be able to push the mighty ship of socialism with Chinese characteristics to ride the wind and waves and make a steady progress.","The article ""Enhancing Strategic Stamina in Adhering to the 'Two Combinations'"" discusses the importance of maintaining strategic determination, judgment, planning, and winning the initiative in the face of complex and profound international situations and arduous tasks of reform and development.

“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放（深入学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想） 来源：人民网－人民日报 作者：任理轩 责任编辑：于海洋 2023-08-16 16:45:21 0,历史的进程从哪里开始，思想的进程就从哪里开始。一部人类发展史，从某种意义上说就是一部思想发展史，就是一部在思想解放中不断打开人类文明进步大门、增强人类文明发展动力的历史。中国共产党是一个高度重视思想解放的马克思主义政党，在一次又一次的思想解放中拓展通向真理的道路、推动党和人民事业发展。在文化传承发展座谈会上，习近平总书记强调：“‘第二个结合’是又一次的思想解放，让我们能够在更广阔的文化空间中，充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源，探索面向未来的理论和制度创新。”习近平总书记的重要论述，深刻揭示了把马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合这“第二个结合”的重大现实意义和深远历史意义，深刻彰显了我们党的历史自信、文化自信，为我们在新时代新征程继续推进马克思主义中国化时代化、建设中华民族现代文明指明了前进方向。 “第二个结合”是中国共产党人在艰辛探索中实现的又一次的思想解放 辽阔中华大地上孕育形成的中华文明，经过漫长历史岁月的累积、聚合、交融，形成独特价值观念、成熟政治制度、无数创造发明……源远流长、博大精深，独树一帜、屹立于世。中华优秀传统文化是中华文明的智慧结晶和精华所在，是中华民族的根和魂，其中的文化基因和精神标识彰显着中华民族在长期奋斗中开展的精神活动、进行的理性思维、创造的文化成果，形成了中国人看待世界、看待社会、看待人生的独特价值体系、文化内涵和精神品质，浸润着中华民族的血脉和灵魂。 鸦片战争后，中国逐步沦为半殖民地半封建社会，国家蒙辱、人民蒙难、文明蒙尘。落后挨打的局面引发人们对中华传统文化的反思。在反思中，有人陷入历史虚无主义、文化虚无主义，把造成国家积贫积弱的原因完全归结为中华传统文化落后，出现了文化自卑自弃心理，对中华传统文化采取全盘否定的态度，有人甚至喊出“全盘西化”等极端口号。这种把中华传统文化与现代化割裂开来、对立起来的思想谬误，阻碍了中国人民对现代化道路的探索。 历史是文明的载体，一年又一年记录书写；文明是历史的血脉，一代又一代无法割断。每一种文明都延续着一个国家和民族的精神血脉。必须承认，传统文化在其形成和发展过程中，不可避免会受到当时人们认识水平、时代条件、社会制度等的局限性的制约和影响，因而不可避免地会存在陈旧过时的东西。但是，一个抛弃了或者背叛了自己历史文化的民族，不仅不可能发展起来，而且很可能上演一幕幕历史悲剧。古今中外的历史和现实都表明，对于传统文化，只要结合新的实践和时代要求进行选择取舍，有鉴别地对待、有扬弃地继承，就能让其获得新的力量、放射新的光芒。看西方文明发展史，14至16世纪的文艺复兴运动重新发掘古希腊、古罗马文明，倡导人文主义，反对宗教神学、教权主义，深刻影响西方文明进程。看中华文明发展史，中华传统文化绝非千年如斯，而是在海纳百川、吐故纳新中日新不已，展现出恒久的生命力。这是文明发展的规律。 中国共产党是马克思主义的坚定信仰者和实践者，也是中华优秀传统文化的忠实传承者和弘扬者。在中华民族救亡图存之际，中国共产党人找到了马克思主义，拿起了真理的武器，民族复兴的伟业从此有了科学理论的指引。同时，中国共产党人坚决反对历史虚无主义、文化虚无主义。毛泽东同志指出：“我们是马克思主义的历史主义者，我们不应当割断历史。从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，承继这一份珍贵的遗产”“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件”。邓小平同志强调：“我们要用历史教育青年，教育人民”“要懂得些中国历史，这是中国发展的一个精神动力”。随着马克思主义中国化时代化的深入推进，我们党不断深化对马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化关系的认识。 中国特色社会主义进入新时代，中华民族伟大复兴进入关键时期，我们更加需要文化繁荣兴盛，为探索面向未来的理论和制度创新拓展更广阔的文化空间，为建设中华民族现代文明夯实文化根基。习近平总书记发表一系列重要论述，深刻阐明如何正确认识和对待中华优秀传统文化、如何科学把握马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化之间的关系，把我们党对这些问题的认识提高到新的历史高度。习近平总书记指出：“中华优秀传统文化是中华民族的精神命脉，是涵养社会主义核心价值观的重要源泉，也是我们在世界文化激荡中站稳脚跟的坚实根基。增强文化自觉和文化自信，是坚定道路自信、理论自信、制度自信的题中应有之义。”在庆祝中国共产党成立100周年大会上，习近平总书记首次提出“两个结合”：“把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合”。在文化传承发展座谈会上，习近平总书记明确提出“‘第二个结合’是又一次的思想解放”。这一重大论断，是对马克思主义中国化时代化历史经验的深刻总结，是对中华文明发展规律的深刻把握。把马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合这“第二个结合”，集中而鲜明地体现了中国共产党人不是历史虚无主义者、文化虚无主义者，我们决不抛弃马克思主义这个魂脉，也决不抛弃中华优秀传统文化这个根脉，把坚守好这个魂和根作为理论创新的基础和前提，进一步拓展了马克思主义中国化时代化的根本途径。这无疑是又一次的思想解放。 “第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放具有重大而深远的意义 人类社会每一次重大跃进，人类文明每一次重大发展，都以知识更新、思想解放为先导和动力。习近平总书记强调：“价值先进、思想解放，是一个社会活力的来源。”思想解放让人们从旧有观念、陈旧思想的束缚中摆脱出来，在更广的空间、更高的层次上进行创新创造，推动文明发展、社会进步。 中国共产党在一百多年的奋斗历程中，始终坚持以思想解放引领党和人民事业发展，带领人民取得革命、建设、改革的一个又一个胜利。延安时期，我们党在同主观主义、教条主义的斗争中不断解放思想，确立实事求是的思想路线。“文革”结束后，在党和国家面临何去何从的重大历史关头，我们党坚持解放思想，开启改革开放和社会主义现代化建设历史新时期。坚持解放思想，就能促进思想观念、思维方式更新，使我们的思想和行动更加符合客观规律，开辟党和国家事业发展新局面。“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，造就了一个有机统一的新的文化生命体，让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的，让经由“结合”而形成的新文化成为中国式现代化的文化形态。“结合”筑牢了道路根基，打开了创新空间，巩固了文化主体性，其意义重大而深远。 从中华民族发展史看，“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，让中国人民坚定文化自信，让中华民族以昂扬的姿态屹立于世界民族之林。习近平总书记强调：“我们生而为中国人，最根本的是我们有中国人的独特精神世界，有百姓日用而不觉的价值观。”对于一个国家、一个民族发展来说，文化自信是更基础、更广泛、更深厚的自信，是更基本、更深沉、更持久的力量。鸦片战争后，伴随着中华民族由盛转衰，一些人文化上趋于妄自菲薄、精神上陷入困顿被动。没有文化上的自信自强，中华民族就难以在世界上站稳脚跟。“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，充分肯定、深入挖掘中华优秀传统文化的时代价值和精神力量，让中国人民在历史进程中积累的强大能量充分爆发出来，焕发出前所未有的历史主动精神、历史创造精神。新时代，中华文明探源工程取得重要进展，中华优秀传统文化传承发展工程大力推进，长城、大运河、长征、黄河、长江国家文化公园建设有序开展，国家版本馆建成开馆，“考古热”“博物馆热”“非遗热”“古籍热”“国潮热”持续兴起……我们用马克思主义真理的力量激活了中华文明，将中华优秀传统文化内涵创造性凝结于社会主义核心价值观中，以文培元、凝神铸魂。今天，中国人民的前进动力更加强大、奋斗精神更加昂扬、必胜信念更加坚定，正在以坚定的文化自信书写新时代中国发展的伟大历史。 从马克思主义发展史看，“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，让马克思主义具有鲜明的中国特色、中国风格、中国气派，放射出更加耀眼的真理光芒。习近平总书记强调：“只有植根本国、本民族历史文化沃土，马克思主义真理之树才能根深叶茂。”一部马克思主义发展史，就是不断吸收人类历史上一切优秀思想文化成果丰富自己的历史。马克思主义一来到中国，就以真理的味道深深吸引着中国的先进分子。中国共产党人深刻把握马克思主义和中华优秀传统文化高度的契合性，以中华优秀传统文化为马克思主义发展提供源头活水，让它在中国大地扎根开花结果，不断彰显蓬勃生机和旺盛活力。“第二个结合”，让马克思主义的思想精髓与中华优秀传统文化中的治国之道、道德理念、思想方法，同中国人民的宇宙观、天下观、社会观、道德观相互融合、相互成就，激荡起积淀在中华民族文化基因和精神血脉中的理念、智慧、气度、神韵，让马克思主义具有了更宽广、更深厚的文明底蕴，展现出鲜明的中国特色、中国风格、中国气派，在中华大地上放射出更加耀眼的真理光芒。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，科学回答新时代坚持和发展什么样的中国特色社会主义、怎样坚持和发展中国特色社会主义等重大时代课题，创立了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是当代中国马克思主义、二十一世纪马克思主义，是中华文化和中国精神的时代精华，是“两个结合”的光辉典范，实现了马克思主义中国化时代化新的飞跃，为丰富发展马克思主义作出了原创性贡献。 从科学社会主义发展史看，“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，拓展了中国特色社会主义道路的文化根基，赋予中国式现代化以深厚底蕴。习近平总书记强调：“我们的社会主义为什么不一样？为什么能够生机勃勃充满活力？关键就在于中国特色，中国特色的关键就在于‘两个结合’。”世界社会主义500年，经历了从空想到科学、从理论到实践、从一国实践到多国发展的过程，其间既有高潮也有低谷，遭遇过许多波折。我们党带领中国人民开创中国特色社会主义道路，让科学社会主义在21世纪的中国焕发出新的蓬勃生机。中国特色社会主义道路，是在马克思主义指导下走出来的，也是从5000多年中华文明史中走出来的。我们党坚持把科学社会主义基本原则同本国具体实际、历史文化传统、时代要求紧密结合起来，在实践中不断探索总结，走出并不断发展符合中国国情、反映中国人民意愿的正确道路。只有立足5000多年波澜壮阔的中华文明史，我们才能真正理解中国特色社会主义道路的历史必然、文化内涵、深厚底蕴、独特优势。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义道路，成功推进和拓展了中国式现代化。正是扎根于中华优秀传统文化，中国式现代化形成了独特的世界观、价值观、历史观、文明观、民主观、生态观等及其伟大实践。“第二个结合”拓展了中国特色社会主义道路的文化根基，赋予中国式现代化以深厚底蕴。站立在960多万平方公里的广袤土地上，吸吮着中华民族漫长奋斗积累的文化养分，拥有14亿多中国人民聚合的磅礴之力，我们坚持走自己的路，具有无比广阔的舞台，具有无比深厚的历史底蕴，具有无比强大的前进定力。 从人类文明发展史看，“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，为人类文明发展作出重大贡献。习近平总书记强调：“中国共产党将致力于推动文明交流互鉴，促进人类文明进步。”马克思主义产生于19世纪的欧洲，其哲学、政治经济学、科学社会主义三大组成部分分别来源于德国古典哲学、英国古典政治经济学、法国空想社会主义。中华优秀传统文化产生于中华大地，作为其核心的思想文化的形成和发展，大体经历了先秦诸子百家争鸣、两汉经学兴盛、魏晋南北朝玄学流行、隋唐儒释道并立、宋明理学发展等几个历史时期。马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化来源不同，但中国共产党人深刻把握二者高度的契合性，推动二者有机结合，造就了一个有机统一的新的文化生命体，让经由“结合”而形成的新文化成为中国式现代化的文化形态。“第二个结合”作为又一次的思想解放，生动彰显了中国共产党人的文明观，为人类文明在交流互鉴中不断创新发展树立了典范。中国式现代化，深深植根于中华优秀传统文化，体现科学社会主义的先进本质，借鉴吸收一切人类优秀文明成果，代表人类文明进步的发展方向，展现了不同于西方现代化模式的新图景，是一种全新的人类文明形态。中国式现代化作为人类文明新形态，与全球其他文明相互借鉴，必将极大丰富世界文明百花园。 在“第二个结合”中不断探索面向未来的理论和制度创新 对历史最好的继承，就是创造新的历史；对人类文明最大的礼敬，就是创造人类文明新形态。习近平总书记强调：“充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源，探索面向未来的理论和制度创新。”这是坚持“第二个结合”，在继承历史中创造新的历史、在礼敬人类文明中创造人类文明新形态的根本所在。 运用科学的世界观和方法论推进理论和制度创新。万物得其本者生，百事得其道者成。探索面向未来的理论和制度创新，必须运用科学的世界观和方法论。我们坚持以马克思主义为指导，就要运用其科学的世界观和方法论来研究问题、解决问题。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想坚持运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观和方法论，既部署“过河”的任务，又指导解决“桥或船”的问题。“六个必须坚持”更是从世界观和方法论的高度深刻阐述了推进理论创新的科学方法、正确路径。我们必须坚持人民至上、坚持自信自立、坚持守正创新、坚持问题导向、坚持系统观念、坚持胸怀天下，以客观、科学、礼敬的态度对待历史和传统，取其精华、去其糟粕，扬弃继承、转化创新，不复古泥古，不简单否定，更好把马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合，不断提高探索面向未来的理论和制度创新的能力与水平。 推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展。中华优秀传统文化源远流长、博大精深。更好推进“第二个结合”，充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源，以古人之规矩开自己之生面，要求我们思接千载、视通万里，入乎其中、出乎其外，不断推进研究阐发、教育普及、保护传承、创新发展、传播交流等工作，推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展。这是在“第二个结合”中不断探索面向未来的理论和制度创新的题中应有之义。新时代，故宫博物院、陕西历史博物馆等游人如织，非遗产品广受欢迎，《最美中国戏》《中国诗词大会》等传统文化节目热度攀升……经过创造性转化、创新性发展，中华优秀传统文化中蕴含的哲学思想、人文精神、价值理念、道德规范等得到传承弘扬。我们要深刻认识到中华优秀传统文化具有超越时空、历久弥新的强大魅力，可以为认识和改造世界提供有益启迪，为治国理政提供有益启示，为解决人类问题提供思想智慧，是中华民族的突出优势和迈向现代化的宝贵精神财富。必须坚定文化自信，更有效地推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展，从中萃取精华、汲取能量，以今日中国之实践，续写中华文化之辉煌，创造出新时代的理论和制度成果。 充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源不断探索面向未来的理论创新。习近平总书记强调：“回顾党的百年奋斗史，我们党之所以能够在革命、建设、改革各个历史时期取得重大成就，能够领导人民完成中国其他政治力量不可能完成的艰巨任务，根本在于掌握了马克思主义科学理论，并不断结合新的实际推进理论创新”。立足中华民族伟大历史实践和当代实践，用中国道理总结好中国经验，把中国经验提升为中国理论，以中国理论解决中国问题，必须坚持解放思想，以更加开阔的视野，深入研究、充分运用中华优秀传统文化中与马克思主义相契合、对解决未来发展重大理论和实践问题具有时代价值的宝贵资源，以守正创新的正气和锐气推进理论创新。我们既要坚持马克思主义指导地位，以马克思主义立场观点方法激活中华优秀传统文化，使中华优秀传统文化获得新的时代意蕴和表现形式；又要着眼现实需要，用中华优秀传统文化的精神内核和独特标识丰富和发展马克思主义，使二者在形式、内容、价值追求等各方面不断从相互契合走向深度融合，继续推进马克思主义中国化时代化，形成更具吸引力、影响力、解释力、说服力的新理念新思想新战略，更好指导中国式现代化崭新实践。 充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源不断探索面向未来的制度创新。习近平总书记指出：“一个国家选择什么样的国家制度和国家治理体系，是由这个国家的历史文化、社会性质、经济发展水平决定的。”在几千年的历史演进中，中华民族形成了关于国家制度和国家治理的丰富思想。比如，我们党开创的人民代表大会制度、政治协商制度，与中华文明的民本思想、天下共治理念，“共和”“商量”的施政传统，“兼容并包、求同存异”的政治智慧都有深刻关联。又如，我们没有搞联邦制、邦联制，确立了单一制国家形式，实行民族区域自治制度，就是顺应向内凝聚、多元一体的中华民族发展大趋势，承继九州共贯、六合同风、四海一家的中国文化大一统传统。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央推进全面深化改革，绘就中国特色社会主义的制度图谱，筑牢了国家长治久安、人民安居乐业的制度基础。面向未来，我们要进一步解放思想，深刻总结、充分运用我国古代关于国家制度的思想精华和实践成果中与马克思主义相契合、与实际需要相适应的宝贵资源，在传承中华文明中不断增强制度创新的文化动力，创造既适应中国式现代化要求又符合中华文明发展规律、体现中华文明独特创造和价值理念的制度成果，不断夯实中国制度优势的文化根基，推动中国制度在实践中更好发挥整体效能、治理效能。 思想解放开天地，无边光景一时新。“第二个结合”，表明我们党对中国道路、理论、制度的认识达到了新高度，表明我们党的历史自信、文化自信达到了新高度，表明我们党在传承中华优秀传统文化中推进文化创新的自觉性达到了新高度。新征程上，我们要坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深刻领会“第二个结合”的重大意义，坚持以思想解放推进全面建设社会主义现代化国家、实现中华民族伟大复兴的历史进程。扬起思想解放的风帆，开启文化创新的航程，我们必将在“第二个结合”中创造光耀时代、光耀世界的中华民族现代文明。

"" General Secretary Xi Jinping's important exposition has profoundly revealed the great practical significance and far-reaching historical significance of the ""second combination"" of the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, profoundly manifested the Party's historical and cultural self-confidence, and pointed out the way for us to continue to push forward the Chineseization of Marxism and the modernization of the Chinese nation and build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation in the new era and new journey. It has pointed out the way forward for us to continue to promote the modernization of Marxism in the new era and the new journey of building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. The ""second combination"" is another ideological liberation achieved by the Chinese Communists in their arduous exploration. The Chinese civilization, nurtured on the vast Chinese land, has accumulated, coalesced, and intermingled over a long period of time, forming unique values, a mature political system, and countless creations and inventions... ...has a long history, is broad and profound, and is unique and stands out in the world. Excellent traditional Chinese culture is the crystallization of the wisdom and essence of Chinese civilization, and is the root and soul of the Chinese nation. The cultural genes and spiritual symbols therein manifest the spiritual activities, rational thinking and cultural achievements of the Chinese nation during its long struggle, and form the unique value system, cultural connotations and spiritual qualities with which the Chinese people view the world, society and life, and imbue the blood and soul of the Chinese nation with them. It has infused the blood and soul of the Chinese nation. After the Opium War, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, with the country humiliated, the people in trouble, and civilization in the dust. The situation of lagging behind and being beaten triggered people's reflection on traditional Chinese culture. In the reflection, some people fell into historical nihilism, cultural nihilism, the cause of the country's poverty and weakness is attributed entirely to the backwardness of traditional Chinese culture, the emergence of a cultural inferiority complex and self-abandonment mentality, the traditional Chinese culture to take a total rejection of the attitude of some people even shouted ""total westernization"" and other extreme slogans. This ideological fallacy of separating and opposing traditional Chinese culture and modernization has hindered the Chinese people's exploration of the road to modernization. History is the carrier of civilization, recorded and written year after year; civilization is the bloodline of history, which cannot be severed generation after generation. Every civilization continues the spiritual bloodline of a country and nation. It must be admitted that traditional culture, in its formation and development, will inevitably be constrained and influenced by the limitations of people's level of understanding, the conditions of the times, and the social system at that time, and so on, and thus there will inevitably be obsolete and outdated things. However, a nation that abandons or betrays its own history and culture is not only unlikely to develop, but is also likely to stage a historical tragedy. History and reality at home and abroad have shown that traditional culture can gain new strength and radiate new light as long as it is selected in the light of new practices and the requirements of the times, and is treated with discrimination and inherited with abandonment. Looking at the history of the development of Western civilization, the Renaissance movement of the 14th to 16th centuries rediscovered ancient Greek and Roman civilization, advocated humanism, and opposed religious theology and clericalism, which profoundly influenced the course of Western civilization. Looking at the history of the development of Chinese civilization, the traditional Chinese culture is by no means a millennium old, but rather, it is constantly evolving in the process of accepting all rivers and exhuming the old and accepting the new, and has demonstrated its everlasting vitality. This is the law of civilization development. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is a firm believer and practitioner of Marxism, as well as a faithful inheritor and promoter of Chinese traditional culture. At the time of the Chinese nation's salvation and survival, the CPC found Marxism and took up the weapon of truth, and the great cause of national rejuvenation has been guided by scientific theories ever since. At the same time, the CPC resolutely opposes historical nihilism and cultural nihilism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, ""We are Marxist historians, we should not cut off history. From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should summarize and inherit this precious heritage"" ""China's long feudal society has created a splendid ancient culture. Cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, eliminating its feudal dross and absorbing its democratic essence is a necessary condition for the development of a new national culture and the enhancement of national self-confidence."" Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that ""we have to educate the youth and the people with history"" and ""to know some Chinese history, which is a spiritual driving force for China's development"". With the deepening of the modernization of Marxism, the Party has deepened its understanding of the relationship between Marxism and Chinese traditional culture. As socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation enters a critical period, we need even more cultural prosperity to expand a broader cultural space for exploring future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovations, and to strengthen the cultural foundation for building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of important remarks, profoundly clarifying how to correctly understand and treat the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and how to scientifically grasp the relationship between Marxism and the excellent traditional Chinese culture, thus raising the Party's understanding of these issues to a new historical level. Chinese excellent traditional culture is the spiritual lifeblood of the Chinese nation, an important source of nourishing socialist core values, and a solid foundation for us to stand firm amidst the world's cultural turbulence. Enhancing cultural self-consciousness and cultural self-confidence is the proper meaning of firm road, theoretical and institutional self-confidence."" At the conference celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping first put forward ""two combinations"": ""combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities, and combining them with China's outstanding traditional culture."" At the symposium on the development of cultural heritage, General Secretary Xi Jinping explicitly proposed that ""the 'second combination' is another ideological liberation"". This major assertion is a profound summary of the historical experience of the Chineseization and modernization of Marxism and a profound grasp of the laws of the development of Chinese civilization. The ""second combination"" of combining the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture centrally and distinctly embodies the fact that the CPC is not a historical nihilist or a cultural nihilist, and that we will never abandon the soul and vein of Marxism, nor the root and vein of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and that we will hold on to this soul and root as the basis and prerequisite for theoretical innovation. We will never abandon the soul of Marxism, nor the root of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and we will take holding on to this soul and root as the foundation and prerequisite for theoretical innovation, further expanding the fundamental way of the modernization of Marxism. This is undoubtedly another ideological liberation. ""The second combination is of great and far-reaching significance as another ideological emancipation. Every major leap forward in human society and every major development of human civilization is preceded and motivated by the updating of knowledge and the emancipation of ideas. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""advanced values and ideological emancipation are the source of a society's vitality."" Ideological emancipation allows people to free themselves from the constraints of old concepts and stereotypical thinking, to innovate and create in a wider space and at a higher level, and to promote the development of civilization and social progress. In its more than 100 years of struggle, the CPC has always insisted on ideological emancipation to lead the development of the Party and the people's cause, and has led the people to achieve victory after victory in revolution, construction and reform. During the Yan'an period, the CPC continuously emancipated its mind and established the ideological line of seeking truth from facts in the struggle against subjectivism and dogmatism. ""After the end of the Cultural Revolution, when the Party and the country were facing a major historical crisis, the Party insisted on emancipation of the mind and opened up a new period of reform, opening up and socialist modernization. Adherence to emancipation of the mind can promote the renewal of ideological concepts and ways of thinking, make our thoughts and actions more in line with the objective laws, and open up a new situation for the development of the Party and the country. The ""second combination"", as another emancipation of ideas, has created a new organically unified cultural organism, making Marxism Chinese, the excellent traditional Chinese culture modern, and the new culture formed through the ""combination"" a modernized cultural form of the Chinese style. The new culture formed through the ""combination"" will become a modernized form of Chinese culture. The ""combination"" builds the foundation of the road, opens the space for innovation, and consolidates the cultural subjectivity, which is of great and far-reaching significance. In the history of the development of the Chinese nation, the ""second combination"" has served as yet another ideological liberation, allowing the Chinese people to be firm in their cultural self-confidence, and allowing the Chinese nation to stand tall among the peoples of the world with a vigorous attitude. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""We are born Chinese, and the most fundamental thing is that we have the unique spiritual world of the Chinese people, and the values that the people use every day without realizing it."" For the development of a country and a nation, cultural self-confidence is a more basic, broader and deeper self-confidence, and a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring strength. After the Opium War, along with the Chinese nation from prosperity to decline, some people tend to be culturally delusional, spiritually trapped in passivity. Without cultural self-confidence and self-improvement, it is difficult for the Chinese nation to gain a firm foothold in the world. The ""second combination"", as another ideological liberation, fully affirms and deeply excavates the contemporary value and spiritual power of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, so that the powerful energy accumulated by the Chinese people in the course of history has fully exploded, and an unprecedented spirit of historical initiative and creativity has emerged. In the new era, important progress has been made in the project of exploring the origin of Chinese civilization, the project of inheriting and developing Chinese outstanding traditional culture has been vigorously promoted, the construction of the Great Wall, the Grand Canal, the Long March, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River National Cultural Parks has been carried out in an orderly manner, and the National Version Museum has been built and opened, and the ""archaeological fever,"" ""museum fever,"" ""non-heritage fever "", ""non-heritage fever,"" ""antiquities fever,"" ""national tide fever"" continues to rise ...... We have activated Chinese civilization with the power of Marxist truth, creatively condensed the connotations of excellent traditional Chinese culture into socialist core values, and cultivated the spirit and soul with literature. Today, the Chinese people, with a stronger impetus to move forward, a more vigorous spirit of struggle, and a firmer conviction of victory, are writing the great history of China's development in the new era with firm cultural self-confidence. From the history of the development of Marxism, the ""second combination"" as another ideological emancipation, so that Marxism has distinctive Chinese characteristics, Chinese style, Chinese style, radiating a more dazzling light of truth. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""Only when rooted in the fertile soil of the history and culture of one's own country and nation can the tree of truth of Marxism take deep roots and flourish."" A history of the development of Marxism is a history of constantly absorbing all the outstanding ideological and cultural achievements of human history to enrich itself. As soon as Marxism came to China, it deeply attracted Chinese advanced elements with the flavor of truth. The Chinese Communists have profoundly grasped the high degree of compatibility between Marxism and excellent traditional Chinese culture, and have provided source water for the development of Marxism with excellent traditional Chinese culture, so that it has taken root and blossomed on the soil of China, and continues to show vigorous vigor and exuberant vitality. ""The second combination"", so that the ideological essence of Marxism and the way of governance, moral concepts, and methods of thought in the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and the Chinese people's concepts of the universe, the world, society, and morality can be integrated with each other and mutually accomplished, and stir up the ideas, wisdom, and temperament that have been accumulated in the cultural genes and spiritual bloodline of the Chinese nation, This has given Marxism a broader and deeper civilizational heritage, demonstrated its distinctive Chinese characteristics, style and style, and radiated a more dazzling light of truth on the Chinese soil. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Chinese Communist Party, mainly represented by Comrade Xi Jinping, has scientifically answered the major issues of the times, such as what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics should be adhered to and developed in the new era, and how to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and created Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century Marxism, which is the essence of Chinese culture and the Chinese spirit of the times, and is a glorious example of ""combining the two"", realizing a new leap in the Chineseization of Marxism and its modernization, and making an original contribution to the enrichment and development of Marxism. In the history of the development of scientific socialism, the ""second combination"", as another ideological emancipation, has expanded the cultural foundation of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and has given Chinese-style modernization a profound content. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: ""Why is our socialism different? Why can it be vibrant and dynamic? The key lies in Chinese characteristics, and the key to Chinese characteristics lies in the 'two combinations'."" In the 500 years of world socialism, it has gone through a process from fantasy to science, from theory to practice, and from one country's practice to the development of many countries, during which there have been both highs and lows, and many ups and downs have been encountered. The Party has led the Chinese people to create the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, giving scientific socialism new vigor in 21st century China. The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is developed under the guidance of Marxism and from the history of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization. The Party insists on closely combining the basic principles of scientific socialism with the specific realities of the country, its historical and cultural traditions, and the requirements of the times, and constantly explores and summarizes them in practice, so as to come up with and continuously develop the correct path that meets China's national conditions and reflects the will of the Chinese people. Only based on the 5,000-year history of Chinese civilization can we truly understand the historical necessity, cultural connotation, profound heritage and unique advantages of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has unswervingly taken the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, successfully promoting and expanding Chinese-style modernization. Rooted in the excellent traditional Chinese culture, Chinese-style modernization has developed a unique worldview, values, history, civilization, democracy, ecology and its great practices. The ""second combination"" expands the cultural foundation of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics and gives Chinese-style modernization a profound content. Standing on a vast land area of more than 9.6 million square kilometers, sucking in the cultural nutrients accumulated by the Chinese nation in its long struggle, and possessing the majestic strength of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people, we have an incomparably broad stage, an incomparably deep historical background, and an incomparably strong determination to move forward by adhering to our own path. In the history of human civilization, the ""second union"" has made a significant contribution to the development of human civilization as another ideological liberation. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""the CPC will be committed to promoting exchanges and mutual understanding among civilizations, and promoting the progress of human civilization."" Marxism arose in Europe in the 19th century, and its three major components of philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism originated from German classical philosophy, British classical political economy, and French utopian socialism, respectively. Chinese excellent traditional culture arose in the Chinese land, as the formation and development of its core ideology and culture, roughly experienced the pre-Qin plurality of hundred schools of thought, the two Han dynasty scriptures flourished, Wei Jin and the North and South Dynasties metaphysics popularity, Sui and Tang Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism stand side by side, the development of Song and Ming ethics and other historical periods. Marxism and Chinese traditional culture come from different sources, but the Chinese Communists have deeply grasped the high degree of compatibility between the two, and have promoted the organic combination of the two, creating a new organically unified cultural organism, so that the new culture formed through the ""combination"" has become a modernized cultural form of Chinese style. The ""second combination"", as another ideological liberation, vividly manifests the civilization concept of the Chinese Communist Party, and sets an example for human civilization to continuously innovate and develop through exchanges and mutual understanding. Chinese-style modernization is deeply rooted in the excellent traditional Chinese culture, embodies the advanced nature of scientific socialism, draws on and absorbs all the outstanding civilization achievements of mankind, represents the development direction of human civilization progress, and shows a new picture different from that of the Western modernization model, which is a brand-new form of human civilization. As a new form of human civilization, Chinese-style modernization, drawing on other civilizations around the world, will greatly enrich the garden of world civilization. The best way to inherit history is to create a new history, and the greatest tribute to human civilization is to create a new form of human civilization. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""Make full use of the valuable resources of the excellent traditional Chinese culture to explore future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovations."" This is fundamental to adhering to the ""second combination"", creating new history in inheriting history, and creating a new form of human civilization in paying homage to human civilization. Utilizing scientific worldview and methodology to promote theoretical and institutional innovation. Everything is born in its own right, and everything is accomplished in its own way. To explore future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovations, it is necessary to apply a scientific worldview and methodology. By adhering to Marxism as our guide, we must apply its scientific worldview and methodology to study and solve problems. Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era adheres to the worldview and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, deploying the task of ""crossing the river"" and guiding the solution of the problem of ""bridges or boats"". The ""six must adhere to"" is a profound elaboration of the scientific method and correct path to promote theoretical innovation from the height of worldview and methodology. We must insist on people's supremacy, self-confidence and self-reliance, righteousness and innovation, problem orientation, systematic conception, and a mindfulness of the world, treat history and traditions with objectivity, science, and courtesy, take the essence and discard the dross, promote and discard inheritance, and transform and innovate, do not revert to the past or negate it, and better integrate the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, so as to continuously improve our ability to explore theories and systematic innovations for the future. We should not be conservative, not simply negate, but better combine the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and constantly improve our ability and level of exploring future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovation. Promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture. Chinese excellent traditional culture has a long history and is profound and profound. To better promote the ""second combination"", to fully utilize the valuable resources of Chinese excellent traditional culture, to open up one's own face based on the rules of the ancients, we are required to think a thousand years ahead, to see ten thousand miles, to enter into it, to leave it, and to continuously promote the work of research and exposition, education and popularization, preservation and inheritance, innovation and development, and dissemination and exchange, and to promote the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese excellent traditional culture. We will continue to promote research and interpretation, education and popularization, protection and inheritance, innovative development, dissemination and exchange, and promote the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese outstanding traditional culture. This is the proper meaning of the ""second combination"" to continuously explore future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovations. In the new era, the Forbidden City Museum and the Shaanxi History Museum are crowded with visitors, non-legacy products are popular, and traditional cultural programs such as ""The Most Beautiful Chinese Drama"" and ""Chinese Poetry Conference"" have become more popular....... Through creative transformation and innovative development, the philosophical thoughts, humanistic spirit, values and moral norms contained in the excellent traditional Chinese culture have been inherited and carried forward. have been inherited and carried forward. We need to deeply realize that the Chinese outstanding traditional culture has a powerful charm that transcends time and space and endures through the ages, and can provide useful enlightenment for understanding and transforming the world, useful insights for governing the country, and ideological wisdom for solving the problems of mankind, which is the outstanding advantage of the Chinese nation and a valuable spiritual wealth for the modernization of the Chinese nation. We must be firm in our cultural confidence, promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture more effectively, extract the essence and energy from it, renew the splendor of Chinese culture with the practice of today's China, and create the theoretical and institutional achievements of the new era. Fully utilize the valuable resources of the excellent traditional Chinese culture to continuously explore future-oriented theoretical innovation. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""Looking back on the Party's century-long history of struggle, the reason why our Party has been able to make significant achievements in various historical periods of revolution, construction, and reform, and to lead the people to accomplish arduous tasks that were impossible for other political forces in China, lies fundamentally in the fact that it has grasped the scientific theories of Marxism, and has constantly pushed forward the theoretical innovations in the light of the new realities. "". Based on the great historical practice of the Chinese nation and contemporary practice, summarizing Chinese experience with Chinese reasoning, upgrading Chinese experience into Chinese theory, and solving Chinese problems with Chinese theory, it is necessary to insist on emancipation of the mind, and, with a broader vision, to conduct in-depth studies and make full use of the valuable resources in the excellent traditional Chinese culture that are compatible with Marxism and of value for the times in solving the major theoretical and practical problems of future development. Promote theoretical innovation with the righteousness and sharpness of observing and innovating. We should not only adhere to the guiding position of Marxism, activate the excellent traditional Chinese culture with Marxist positions and viewpoints and methods, so that the excellent traditional Chinese culture can acquire new meanings and forms of expression for the times; we should also focus on the needs of reality, enrich and develop Marxism with the spiritual kernel and unique symbols of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, so that the two can continuously move from mutual compatibility to in-depth fusion in terms of form, content, and the pursuit of values, so as to continue to promote Chinese Marxism. We will continue to promote the modernization of Marxism and form new ideas and strategies that are more attractive, influential, explanatory and persuasive, so as to better guide the new practice of Chinese-style modernization. Fully utilize the valuable resources of the excellent traditional Chinese culture to continuously explore future-oriented institutional innovation. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""What kind of national system and national governance system a country chooses is determined by the country's history and culture, the nature of its society, and its level of economic development."" In the course of thousands of years of historical evolution, the Chinese nation has formed a wealth of ideas about national systems and national governance. For example, the system of people's congresses and the system of political consultation initiated by our Party are closely related to the Chinese civilization's people-centered ideology, the concept of common governance under the sky, the tradition of governance of ""republicanism"" and ""negotiation,"" and the political wisdom of ""seeking common ground while reserving differences,"" all of which are related to the Chinese civilization's political wisdom. There is a deep connection with the political wisdom of ""being inclusive and seeking common ground while reserving differences"". Another example is that we did not engage in federalism or confederalism, but established a unitary form of state and implemented the system of regional ethnic autonomy, which is in line with the general trend of inward cohesion and unity in diversity in the development of the Chinese nation, as well as inheriting the tradition of the great unity of Chinese culture, which is characterized by the commonality of the nine states, the winds of the Six Contracts, and the unity of the four seas. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has pushed forward the comprehensive deepening of reforms, mapped out the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and built the institutional foundation for the country's long-lasting peace and stability and the people's contentment and happiness. Looking to the future, we should further emancipate our minds, deeply summarize and fully utilize the valuable resources in the essence of China's ancient thoughts and practical achievements on the state system that are compatible with Marxism and actual needs, continuously enhance the cultural impetus for institutional innovation in the inheritance of Chinese civilization, and create institutional achievements that not only meet the requirements of Chinese-style modernization, but also conform to the laws of development of Chinese civilization and embody the unique creations and values of Chinese civilization, so as to continuously strengthen the institutional foundation of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the course of inheriting Chinese civilization, we will continue to strengthen the cultural impetus for institutional innovation, create institutional achievements that meet the requirements of Chinese-style modernization, conform to the laws of development of Chinese civilization, and embody the unique creations and values of Chinese civilization. The emancipation of the mind opens up the world, and the boundless light is new for a while. The ""second combination"" indicates that our Party's understanding of China's roads, theories and systems has reached a new height, that our Party's historical and cultural confidence has reached a new height, and that our Party's self-consciousness of promoting cultural innovation in inheriting the excellent traditional Chinese culture has reached a new height. On the new journey, we should adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply understand the significance of the ""Second Combination"", and adhere to the ideological emancipation to promote the construction of a modernized socialist country in all aspects and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the historical process. By hoisting the sail of ideological emancipation and embarking on the voyage of cultural innovation, we will surely create a modern civilization of the Chinese nation that shines in the times and in the world in the ""second combination"". People's Daily (August 16, 2023, 09 Edition)","The article emphasizes the significance of the ""second combination"" of integrating the basic principles of Marxism with excellent traditional Chinese culture, as highlighted by General Secretary Xi Jinping. This approach is seen as a form of ideological emancipation that harnesses the rich heritage of Chinese civilization to further modernize Marxism and contribute to the modernization of the Chinese nation. It underscores the CPC's commitment to ideological innovation, drawing on China's historical and cultural self-confidence to navigate the country's development in the new era.

The text outlines how the CPC, as a Marxist party, values the emancipation of ideas to promote truth and development. It reflects on China's historical challenges and the misinterpretation of traditional Chinese culture as a barrier to modernization, advocating instead for a balanced appreciation that discards outdated aspects while preserving valuable cultural insights.

The ""second combination"" is presented as a strategic move that aligns with the ongoing efforts to enrich socialist core values with Chinese characteristics and to explore theoretical and institutional innovations. This approach not only strengthens the cultural foundation of socialism with Chinese characteristics but also contributes to a unique form of Chinese-style modernization that differs from Western models, suggesting a new contribution to human civilization.

Overall, the article calls for a continued embrace of this ""second combination"" to guide China's path toward a modern civilization that respects its cultural roots while fostering innovation and development."
【理响中国】世界文明百花园中盛开的“中国之花” 来源：中国社会科学网 作者：梁大伟 贾永刚 责任编辑：于海洋 2023-08-15 20:00:10 0,当今世界，团结与分裂碰撞，挑战和危机叠加，不稳定性和不确定性突出，人类社会现代化进程又一次来到历史的十字路口。2023年3月15日，习近平总书记在中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会上强调，面对一系列现代化之问，政党作为引领和推动现代化进程的重要力量，有责任作出回答。这传递了中国共产党希望与各国政党和政治组织携手促进现代化建设、推动世界繁荣进步的真诚意愿，是中国以世界眼光关注人类文明发展的重要体现。探讨这一议题，对深化各国政党关于现代化建设规律的认知，推动各国政党在本国现代化道路上奋勇前进，具有重要的理论意义和实践价值。 坚守人民至上理念，突出现代化方向的人民性 人民至上是实现现代化的价值之基。马克思指出：“过去的一切运动都是少数人的，或者为少数人谋利益的运动。无产阶级的运动是绝大多数人的，为绝大多数人谋利益的独立的运动。”中国共产党始终将人民群众作为推进现代化建设最坚实的根基、最深厚的力量，充分整合广大人民群众的利益，凝聚起具有广泛社会共识的现代化建设观念，把民众需求转化为政党的理念、宗旨、目标，选择符合本国实际的现代化建设道路。现代化道路最终能否走得通、行得稳，关键要看是否坚持以人民为中心。与资本主义现代化主要服务于资产阶级，现代化的成果亦由少数人享有相比，中国共产党的性质宗旨、初心使命、信仰信念、政策主张决定了中国式现代化是社会主义现代化，始终坚持以人民为中心的价值导向，强调现代化建设成果由人民共享，将实现人的自由而全面发展作为现代化建设的最终目标。党的十八大以来，无论是坚持“一个都不能少”打赢脱贫攻坚战，还是推进健康中国、平安中国、美丽中国建设，又或是解决人民最关心最直接最现实的利益问题，都充分展现了党坚持人民至上的价值理念，表达了中国式现代化的人民性特质。心在人民，利归天下。中国式现代化是中国与世界的良性互动，不仅造福中国人民，而且造福世界人民。中国将以更加开放的姿态拥抱世界，加快构建高水平对外开放新格局，为世界提供更多更好的中国制造和中国创造，以及更大规模的中国市场和中国需求，为缩小南北差距，开创人类美好未来献计出力。中国式现代化为人类实现现代化提供了新的选择，为人类文明进步带来了崭新的希望。中国共产党坚定倡导和积极践行全人类共同价值，努力以中国式现代化新成就为世界发展提供新机遇，与各国政党共同肩负起为人民谋幸福、为人类谋进步的历史责任，让现代化更好回应人民各方面诉求和多层次需要，不断把人民对美好生活的向往变成现实。 秉持独立自主原则，探索现代化道路的多样性 独立自主是实现现代化的生动标识。习近平总书记指出：“独立自主是我们党从中国实际出发、依靠党和人民力量进行革命、建设、改革的必然结论。”新中国成立后，我们党一以贯之推进社会主义现代化建设，从第一个五年计划到第十四个五年规划、从总体小康到全面小康、从“四个现代化”到全面建设社会主义现代化国家，中国共产党正是在坚持中国的事情必须由中国人民自己作主的基础上，才实现了中国从一盘散沙到高度统一、从积贫积弱到繁荣富强的历史性变革，书写了经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹，成功推进和拓展了中国式现代化，创造了人类文明新形态。照搬没有出路，模仿容易迷失，实践才出真知。在推动现代化进程中，各国政党要坚持独立自主、自立自强，既要遵循现代化建设一般规律，更要符合本国实际，具有本国特色，不应削足适履，跟在别国后面亦步亦趋，而是努力探索适合本国国情的现代化道路。不求于己而求于人者，未有能自立者也。当今世界，恃强凌弱、巧取豪夺、零和博弈等霸权霸道霸凌行径危害加深，对建设新型国际关系和完善全球治理体系造成了深度挑战。在此严峻形势下，中国的现代化建设始终秉持独立自主原则，坚持道不变、志不改，既不“输入”外国模式，也不“输出”中国模式，更不会要求别国“复制”中国的做法，而是尊重和支持世界不同国家、不同地区各具特色的现代化道路，同世界各国开展友好合作和互利交往，同世界政党分享中国式现代化建设的成功经验，推动不同文明的发展模式交流对话，与世界各国政党一道维护社会公平正义，共同推进世界文明百花园姹紫嫣红、生机盎然。 树立守正创新意识，保持现代化进程的持续性 守正创新是实现现代化的活力之源。习近平总书记指出：“我们从事的是前无古人的伟大事业，守正才能不迷失方向、不犯颠覆性错误，创新才能把握时代、引领时代。” 坚持守正创新，是我们党百年来推进马克思主义中国化时代化得出的规律性认识，是中国特色社会主义新时代的鲜明气象，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的显著标识。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央根据共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律、人类社会发展规律，擘画执政兴国的宏伟蓝图，统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局，协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，在守正与创新的互动共进中推动中国式现代化不断开创新局面，赋予现代化以超越西方的价值理念。“明者因时而变，知者随事而制。”置身世界之变、时代之变、历史之变的世界形势下，各个国家通往现代化的道路并不平坦，各国政党必须恪守正道，以科学的态度对待科学、以真理的精神追求真理，同时要与时俱进，冲破思想观念束缚，突破利益固化藩篱，清除妨碍现代化建设的体制机制障碍，积极学习借鉴世界各国人民创造的现代化文明成果，探索形成具有本国特色的现代化发展路径。求守正以夯实创新之基础，务创新以升华守正之境界。守正并不是固步自封、止步不前，而是守住本和源、根和魂；创新也不是异想天开、恣意妄为，而是在把握事物发展规律的基础上充分发挥人的主观能动性。新征程推进中国式现代化，必须明确守正与创新的辩证关系，既要确保党中央在立场、方向、原则、道路等根本性问题上旗帜鲜明、毫不含糊，也要勇于自我革命、革除自身病症、解决自身问题、实现自我超越，确保社会主义现代化事业顺利推进。“一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。”在世界现代化进程中，中国共产党积极倡导与推动各国政党间的平等交流和互学互鉴，深化拓展各国政党对现代化道路的认识，在守正中把稳舵盘、保持航向，让创新创造的活力充分涌流、争相迸发，为保持世界现代化进程行稳致远提供源源动力，贡献中国力量。 弘扬立己达人精神，增强现代化成果的普惠性 立己达人是实现现代化的应有之义。党的二十大报告开宗明义宣告：“我们党立志于中华民族千秋伟业，致力于人类和平与发展崇高事业，责任无比重大，使命无上光荣。”作为马克思主义政党，中国共产党在领导本国人民探索和进行现代化建设过程中，始终把促进世界和平与发展视为自己的神圣职责，逐步形成了以共建“一带一路”为实践平台，以推动构建人类命运共同体为最高目标，以构建新型国际关系为战略选择等沉甸甸、实打实的国际公共产品，为世界各国人民带去了福祉和希望，昭示了中国共产党的责任与担当。“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人。”世界各国政党在追求现代化的进程中绝不能形成各自为政、单打独斗的分散局面和相互隔阂、彼此对抗的敌对状态。只有加强各国政党间的交流合作，高度弘扬立己达人精神，把人类看成是一荣俱荣、一损俱损的命运共同体，高举和平、发展、合作、共赢旗帜，坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，坚定站在历史正确的一边、站在人类进步的一边，才是推进人类社会现代化的康庄大道。“万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。”在推进现代化的历史进程中，中国共产党绝不会吹灭别人的灯，更不会阻挡别人的路，而是坚定将国家利益与世界责任相结合，凝聚推进现代化的政治共识，促进政党间的团结合作，积极寻找国家间共同的利益增长点和合作共赢点，构建全球文明对话合作网络，丰富交流内容，拓宽合作渠道，提升全球发展的公平性、有效性、协同性，共同做大人类社会现代化的“蛋糕”，努力让现代化的成果更多更公平惠及各国人民。 保持奋发有为姿态，确保现代化领导的坚定性 奋发有为是实现现代化的强劲动力。恩格斯指出：“一个知道自己的目的，也知道怎样达到这个目的的政党，一个真正想达到这个目的并且具有达到这个目的所必不可缺的顽强精神的政党——这样的政党将是不可战胜的。”中国共产党生于忧患、长于忧患、壮大于忧患，屡经磨难而初心不改，屡临绝境而星火燎原，饱尝艰辛而风华正茂，历尽苦难而淬火成钢，坚持以昂扬奋斗的精神风貌和勇于开拓的实干精神，领导社会主义现代化建设取得了举世瞩目的伟大成就，成功开辟了一条中国式现代化道路，带领中国人民意气风发迈上了全面建设社会主义现代化国家的新征程。大道至简，实干为要。现代化不会从天上掉下来，而是要通过发扬历史主动精神干出来。政党必须有不积跬步无以至千里的决心和不获全胜决不收兵的定力，把自身建设和国家现代化建设紧密结合起来，踔厉奋发，勇毅笃行，超越自我，确保始终有信心、有意志、有能力应对好时代挑战、回答好时代命题、呼应好人民期盼，为不断推进现代化进程引领方向、凝聚力量。同时，实现现代化也绝不是一马平川、朝夕之间即可达到。政党要统筹协调各方力量，做好应对复杂局面的准备，在经风雨、见世面中长才干、壮筋骨，坚定斗争意志、增强斗争本领，不能因现实复杂、理想遥远而放弃对现代化的追求。中国共产党在推进现代化建设中，将坚定不移地持续深化拓展平等、开放、合作的全球伙伴关系，同各国政党责任共担、风险共对，同向发力、同向而行，在瞬息万变的国际局势中有效应对现代化进程中的重大风险挑战，坚决反对“新冷战”和打着民主旗号挑动分裂对抗的行径，确保现代化领导的坚定性，以奋发有为的姿态打开现代化事业发展新天地。 人类社会发展进程曲折起伏，各国探索现代化道路的历程充满艰辛。世界各国究竟需要什么样的现代化，怎样才能实现现代化，是随着时代演进而不断加以审视的开放命题。中国式现代化作为人类文明新形态，与全球其他文明相互借鉴，必将极大丰富世界文明百花园。道阻且长，行则将至；行而不辍，未来可期。中国共产党愿同各国政党和政治组织共同担负起探索现代化道路、推动文明进步的政党责任，在推动构建人类命运共同体的征程中携手同行。

20:00:10 0","In today's world, unity and division collide, challenges and crises overlap, instability and uncertainty are prominent, and the process of modernization of human society has once again come to the crossroads of history.2023 On March 15, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized at the High-Level Dialogue between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the World's Political Parties (WPP) that, in the face of a series of modernization questions, political parties, as an important force in leading and promoting the process of modernization, have the responsibility to answer them. . This conveys the CPC's sincere will to join hands with political parties and organizations of all countries to promote modernization and world prosperity and progress, and is an important manifestation of China's concern for the development of human civilization from a global perspective. Exploring this topic is of great theoretical significance and practical value in deepening the knowledge of political parties of all countries about the laws of modernization construction, and in promoting their courageous advancement on the road of modernization in their own countries. Adhering to the concept of people's supremacy and highlighting the people's nature of modernization People's supremacy is the foundation of the value of modernization. Marx pointed out: ""All movements in the past were movements of the minority, or movements for the benefit of the minority. The movement of the proletariat is an independent movement of the vast majority, for the benefit of the vast majority."" The CPC has always regarded the people as the most solid foundation and deepest force for promoting modernization, fully integrating the interests of the broad masses of the people, rallying the concept of modernization with a broad social consensus, translating the people's needs into the party's concepts, purposes, and goals, and choosing a path of modernization that conforms to the actual situation of the country. Whether the road of modernization can ultimately go through and be stable depends on whether it adheres to the people-centered approach. Compared with capitalist modernization, which mainly serves the bourgeoisie and the fruits of modernization are enjoyed by a few people, the CPC's nature, purpose, mission, beliefs and policies determine that Chinese modernization is socialist modernization, which always adheres to the people-centered value orientation, emphasizes that the fruits of modernization should be shared by the people, and takes the realization of people's free and all-round development as the ultimate goal of modernization construction. The realization of free and comprehensive development of human beings is the ultimate goal of modernization. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, whether it is insisting that ""no one should be left behind"" to win the battle against poverty, promoting the construction of a healthy China, a safe China and a beautiful China, or solving the problems of the most direct and realistic interests that people are most concerned about, all of these have fully demonstrated the Party's adherence to the value of the people's supremacy, and expressed the people's qualities of the Chinese-style modernization. The Party's modernization has been characterized by the people's nature. The heart is in the people, and the benefits go to the world. Chinese-style modernization is a benign interaction between China and the world, benefiting not only the Chinese people but also the people of the world. China will embrace the world with a more open attitude, accelerate the construction of a new pattern of opening up to the outside world at a high level, provide the world with more and better Chinese manufacturing and Chinese creation, as well as a larger Chinese market and Chinese demand, and contribute to narrowing the gap between the north and the south and creating a better future for mankind. Chinese-style modernization offers a new option for mankind to achieve modernization and brings fresh hope for the progress of human civilization. The CPC firmly advocates and actively puts into practice the common values of all mankind, strives to provide new opportunities for world development with new achievements in Chinese-style modernization, and shoulders the historical responsibility of seeking happiness for the people and progress for mankind together with political parties of all countries, so that modernization can better respond to people's aspirations in all aspects and needs at multiple levels, and continuously turn people's aspirations for a better life into reality. Upholding the principle of independence and autonomy and exploring the diversity of modernization paths Independence and autonomy are vivid markers of the realization of modernization. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Independence and autonomy is the inevitable conclusion of our Party's starting from China's actuality and relying on the power of the Party and the people to carry out revolution, construction and reform."" After the founding of New China, the Party has consistently promoted socialist modernization, from the first five-year plan to the 14th five-year plan, from overall well-off to comprehensively well-off, and from the ""four modernizations"" to the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist state. It is on the basis of its insistence that the Chinese people must be the masters of their own affairs that the CPC has achieved the historic transformation of China from a fragmented state to a highly unified one, and from poverty and weakness to prosperity and strength, and written two miracles, namely, rapid economic development and long-term social stability, and successfully pushed forward and expanded Chinese-style modernization, creating a new form of human civilization. There is no way out of copying, and imitation is easy to get lost; only practice produces true knowledge. In promoting the modernization process, political parties of all countries should insist on independence, self-reliance and self-improvement, follow the general laws of modernization, conform to the realities of their own countries and have their own characteristics, and strive to explore the path of modernization that suits their own conditions instead of following the footsteps of other countries. No one has ever been able to stand on his own feet if he does not seek for himself but seeks from others. In today's world, the harm of hegemonic and bullying practices such as bullying, trickery and zero-sum games has deepened, posing a profound challenge to the construction of a new type of international relations and the improvement of the global governance system. Under this severe situation, China's modernization has always adhered to the principle of independence and autonomy, insisting that the way remains unchanged and the will remains unchanged, and neither ""importing"" foreign models nor ""exporting"" Chinese models, let alone requesting other countries to ""copy"" China's practices, but rather requesting that other countries ""copy"" China's practices. ""Instead, we respect and support the modernization paths of different countries and regions in the world, develop friendly cooperation and mutually beneficial exchanges with all countries in the world, share with political parties in the world the successful experience of Chinese-style modernization, promote exchanges and dialogues on the development models of different civilizations, and work together with political parties of all countries in the world to safeguard social justice and equity and jointly promote world civilization. The hundred gardens of the world's civilizations are beautiful and vibrant. Establishing a sense of righteousness and innovation to maintain the continuity of the modernization process Righteousness and innovation are the source of vitality for modernization. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""We are engaged in a great cause that no one has ever done before, and only by keeping the right course can we not lose our way or make subversive mistakes, and only by innovating can we grasp the times and lead the times."" Insisting on keeping the right and innovating is the regular understanding derived from the Party's 100 years of advancing the Chineseization and modernization of Marxism, the distinctive meteorology of the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the distinctive logo of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has drawn a grand blueprint for the rise of the country based on the laws of Communist Party governance, socialist construction and human social development, coordinated the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the ""Four Comprehensives"", and made great efforts to protect the interests of the people in the ""Four Comprehensives"" strategic layout, as well as to protect the rights of the people. It has also drawn up a grand blueprint for the development of the country, coordinated the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the ""Four Comprehensives"", and pushed forward Chinese modernization to break new ground in the interaction and co-progress of righteousness and innovation, giving modernization a value concept that transcends the West. ""Those who are wise change according to the times, and those who know make things according to the events."" In the changing world, changing times and changing history, the road to modernization is not smooth for all countries. Political parties of all countries must abide by the right path, treat science with a scientific attitude and pursue truth with the spirit of truth; at the same time, they should keep abreast of the times, break through the constraints of ideology and concepts, break through the barriers of solidified interests, and clear the obstacles of institutions and mechanisms hindering modernization, and actively learn from the fruits of modernization and civilization created by the people of other countries, so as to explore the possibility of forming a modernization system that is unique to the West and that can be implemented in China. We should actively learn from the fruits of modernization and civilization created by people all over the world, and explore and form a modernization and development path with national characteristics. We should seek to keep the right to consolidate the foundation of innovation, and ensure innovation to sublimate the realm of keeping the right. To keep the right is not to be stuck in a rut or stand still, but to keep the origin, root and soul; innovation is not to be whimsical or wanton, but to give full play to human initiative on the basis of grasping the laws of the development of things. In the new journey to promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to clarify the dialectical relationship between correctness and innovation, not only to ensure that the CPC Central Committee is clear and unambiguous on fundamental issues such as stance, direction, principle and road, but also to be brave enough to make a self-revolution, remove its own illnesses, solve its own problems, and achieve self-transcendence, so as to ensure that the cause of socialist modernization is smoothly advanced. ""It is not spring when one flower blooms alone, but when a hundred flowers bloom together, spring fills the garden."" In the process of world modernization, the CPC actively advocates and promotes equal exchanges and mutual learning among political parties of all countries, deepens and expands their understanding of the road to modernization, keeps the steering wheel steady and maintains the course, and lets the vitality of innovation and creativity fully flow and burst forth, so as to provide a source of impetus for the modernization process of the world to keep it steady and make it far-reaching and to contribute to the power of China. Carrying forward the spirit of establishing oneself and reaching out to others, and enhancing the universality of the fruits of modernization Establishing oneself and reaching out to others is the rightful meaning of modernization. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress begins by declaring, ""The Party is committed to the great cause of the Chinese nation and to the noble cause of peace and development of mankind, and its responsibility is immense, and its mission is supremely glorious."" As a Marxist political party, the CPC has always regarded the promotion of world peace and development as its sacred duty in the course of leading its own people to explore and carry out modernization, and has gradually formed the ""One Belt, One Road"" as a practical platform, promoted the construction of a community of human destiny as the highest goal, and constructed a new type of international relations as a strategic choice. The CPC's strategic choices, such as the heavy and practical international public products, have brought benefits and hopes to people all over the world, demonstrating the responsibility and commitment of the CPC. ""One desires to establish oneself and others, and one desires to reach others and others."" In their pursuit of modernization, political parties around the world must not form a fragmented situation where they work separately and alone, or a state of hostility where they are alienated from each other and confront each other. Only by strengthening exchanges and cooperation among political parties of all countries, highly carrying forward the spirit of establishing oneself and reaching out to others, viewing mankind as a community of destiny where both glory and loss are shared, holding high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation, adhering to the concept of security that is common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, and standing firmly on the right side of history and the side of mankind's progress, can we advance the road of modernization of the human society. ""All things coexist without harming each other, and the Tao runs in parallel without contradicting each other."" In the historical process of advancing modernization, the CPC will never blow out other people's lights, let alone block other people's paths. Instead, it will firmly combine national interests with world responsibilities, forge a political consensus on advancing modernization, promote solidarity and cooperation among political parties, actively search for common points of growth of interests and win-win cooperation among countries, build a network of dialogue and cooperation among global civilizations, enrich the content of exchanges, broaden the channels of cooperation, and Enhance the fairness, effectiveness and synergy of global development, jointly enlarge the ""cake"" of modernization of human society, and strive to make the fruits of modernization benefit people of all countries in a greater and more equitable manner. Maintaining the stance of being enterprising and ensuring the firmness of modernization leadership Endeavour is a strong driving force for modernization. Engels pointed out, ""A party that knows its own purpose and how to achieve it, a party that really wants to achieve it and has the indispensable tenacity to do so - such a party will be invincible."" The CPC was born in sorrow, grew up in sorrow, and grew strong in sorrow; it has repeatedly endured trials and tribulations without changing its original mind; it has repeatedly faced desperate situations without starting a prairie fire; it has suffered hardships but flourished; it has undergone hardships but quenched itself into a steel; it has insisted on a spirit of vigorous struggle and a spirit of pioneering and practicality, and it has led the socialist modernization to achieve world-renowned great achievements, successfully opened up a path of modernization of the Chinese style, and has led the Chinese people to It has successfully opened up a path of Chinese-style modernization and led the Chinese people to embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way. The road is simple, and practical work is essential. Modernization will not fall from the sky, but will be achieved by carrying forward the spirit of historical initiative. Political parties must have the determination to make progress step by step and the strength of mind to never quit until they have won the whole battle, to closely integrate their own construction with the modernization of the country, to be energetic, courageous and resolute, and to transcend themselves, so as to make sure that they always have the confidence, the will, and the ability to cope with the challenges of the times, to answer the propositions of the times, and to respond to the people's aspirations, so as to lead the direction and gather the strength for the process of modernization to be continuously pushed forward. At the same time, modernization can never be achieved overnight. Political parties should coordinate all forces, be prepared to cope with complex situations, grow their talents and strengthen their muscles and bones in weathering the storms and seeing the world, strengthen their will to fight and enhance their skills in the struggle, and not give up the pursuit of modernization due to the complexity of the reality and the remoteness of the ideals. In promoting modernization, the CPC will unswervingly continue to deepen and expand the global partnership of equality, openness and cooperation, share responsibilities and risks with political parties of all countries, work in the same direction, move in the same direction, effectively respond to major risks and challenges in the process of modernization in the ever-changing international situation, and resolutely oppose the ""New Cold War"" and the provocative actions under the banner of democracy. We will resolutely oppose the ""new cold war"" and acts of secession and confrontation under the banner of democracy, ensure the firmness of the modernization leadership, and open up new horizons for the development of the modernization cause in a vigorous and enterprising manner. The development process of human society has been full of twists and turns, and the journey of countries in search of the road to modernization has been full of hardships. What kind of modernization is needed by all countries in the world and how to realize it are open propositions that are constantly examined with the evolution of the times. As a new form of human civilization, Chinese-style modernization will enrich the garden of world civilization by drawing on other civilizations around the globe. The road is long, but the journey will be accomplished, and the future is promising if the journey continues unabated. The CPC is willing to work with political parties and organizations of all countries to shoulder the responsibility of exploring the road of modernization and promoting the progress of civilization, and to walk hand in hand in the journey of building a community of human destiny.

Strengthening the party building organs, the army at all levels should be more systematic concepts, problem awareness, the rule of law thinking to examine and grasp, stand on the overall situation to see the party building, integrated into the joint grasp of the party building, to promote the party building work and the organic integration of the business work, the same goal, the deployment of synchronization, the same work, so that the two to achieve the mutual promotion of co-progress. Organizational party building work and business work is organic unity. Party building work well, can provide strong political guarantee for business work. Party building work to avoid ""virtualization"" ""weakening"", we must test the effectiveness of the work of the business work. The reason why individual units appear party affairs and business ""two skins"" problem, mainly because there is no systematic concept to promote the organic integration of the two. In practice, through the party building work to lead and promote business work, and business work to test the effectiveness of party building work, in order to achieve the same direction of aggregation, mutual promotion and progress of the virtuous cycle. Integrated promotion of party building work and business work, is to make party building work and business work initiatives in the deployment of each other, in the implementation of mutual promotion, around the center of party building, good party business to promote business. Promote the organic integration of party building work and business work, mutual promotion, we must dig deep to influence the realization of organic integration of contradictory issues. Adhere to the problem-oriented, find the problem to be accurate, analyze the problem to be thorough, rectify the problem to be real, run to the problem, staring at the problem to change, dig out the deep-seated problems, the hidden problems to find out. In reality, individual party members and cadres believe that the business work is more practical, party building work is more virtual, there is a tendency to focus on business light party thinking. To solve this problem, we need to strengthen education and guidance, so that each party member and cadres deeply realize that the party construction is related to the overall situation of the military construction and fundamental, is not a general work, general responsibility, the party building work is not good, business work is also impossible to grasp. At the same time, we must strictly implement the party building work responsibility system, based on the identification of problems, the implementation of the problem rectification desk management, clear responsibility for the main body, progress time limit and work measures, so that the problem is not solved do not let up, solve the problem is not complete do not let go.

Promote the Party building work mechanism to more accurately dovetail with the needs of operational work, so that wherever military training and preparation work is carried out, Party building work will be extended to wherever it is carried out, integrating the Party's leadership into the whole process of operational work, promoting the grasp of the ordinary, integrated into the daily life, and insisting that the two be studied, deployed, inspected and assessed together. At the same time, organs at all levels should also further study and improve the linkage assessment and evaluation mechanism for party building and operational work, and play the role of the assessment baton, so as to make party building and operational work promote each other, and to form an atmosphere of party building in the organs that is ""strong in party affairs to promote operational work, and solidify the overall situation with party building"".","The article discusses the importance of promoting the organic integration of party building work and business work in the military.

【理响中国】习近平经济思想的逻辑架构 来源：中国社会科学网-中国社会科学报 作者：周绍东 陈艺丹 责任编辑：于海洋 2023-08-17 19:26:28 0,党的十八大以来，面对严峻复杂的国际形势和艰巨繁重的国内改革发展稳定任务，以习近平同志为核心的党中央高瞻远瞩、统揽全局、把握大势，提出了一系列新理念新思想新战略，指导我国经济发展取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，在实践中形成和发展了习近平经济思想。习近平经济思想是马克思主义政治经济学与新时代中国特色社会主义经济实践相结合的产物，赋予了马克思主义政治经济学以鲜明的中国特色、中国风格、中国气派。完整准确地把握习近平经济思想的核心要义、发展历程和逻辑架构，对于推动马克思主义政治经济学中国化时代化发展，对于正确理解中国经济怎么看、怎么干等一系列重大理论和实践问题，都具有十分重要的意义。 深刻回应新时代经济发展 怎么看、怎么干 习近平经济思想是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的重要组成部分，同时也是不断开拓当代中国马克思主义政治经济学新境界的最新成果。马克思主义政治经济学是马克思主义理论体系的三大组成部分之一，根据其研究对象在历史规定性上的不同，具体可以分为广义政治经济学和狭义政治经济学两个类别。广义政治经济学是指一般性的、适合于人类各个社会经济形态的政治经济学。狭义政治经济学是指特殊性的、反映不同社会形态的政治经济学。其中，反映社会主义生产方式和生产关系的政治经济学称为社会主义政治经济学。改革开放以来，基于对社会主义经济建设经验的提炼和总结，中国特色社会主义政治经济学应运而生。相较于社会主义政治经济学，中国特色社会主义政治经济学是个别性的、体现“国别特殊性”的政治经济学。 党的十八大以来，中国特色社会主义进入新时代，以习近平同志为核心的党中央，将新中国成立以来特别是改革开放以来党领导经济建设的各项方针、政策、举措上升到理论层面和学科高度，深刻回答了新时代经济发展怎么看、怎么干等一系列重大理论和实践问题，对马克思主义政治经济学说的创新作出巨大贡献。在这个过程中，习近平经济思想逐步形成并体系化发展。 习近平经济思想从形成到发展，以至体系化呈现，经历了一个动态的发展历程。党的十八大以来至2017年中央经济工作会议，是习近平经济思想的形成阶段。2017年中央经济工作会议明确指出：5年来，我们坚持观大势、谋全局、干实事，成功驾驭了我国经济发展大局，在实践中形成了以新发展理念为主要内容的习近平新时代中国特色社会主义经济思想。会议以“1+7”的逻辑架构对习近平经济思想的丰富内涵进行了科学概括，其中“1”是指新发展理念，“7”是指“七个坚持”。2021年11月，党的十九届六中全会审议通过《中共中央关于党的百年奋斗重大成就和历史经验的决议》（以下简称《决议》），对习近平经济思想进行了提炼和概括。《决议》以“十个明确”对习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的主要内容做出进一步概括，其中第七条指出：明确必须坚持和完善社会主义基本经济制度，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，把握新发展阶段，贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的新发展理念，加快构建以国内大循环为主体、国内国际双循环相互促进的新发展格局，推动高质量发展，统筹发展和安全。“第七个明确”是对习近平经济思想的再概括、再提炼，体现了党的十九大以来习近平经济思想在这一时期实践中的进一步丰富和发展。2022年6月，《习近平经济思想学习纲要》（以下简称《纲要》）出版发行，习近平经济思想得到体系化呈现。《纲要》全面反映了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想在经济领域的原创性贡献，系统阐释了习近平经济思想的基本精神、基本内容、基本要求，完整勾勒了习近平经济思想的理论之纲、思想之要。在实践基础上对理论进行提炼总结的过程，同时也是理论本身不断走向深入的过程。《纲要》实现了对习近平经济思想理论全貌的体系化呈现，也标志着习近平经济思想提升到了新的理论高度。 习近平经济思想是一个系统的理论整体，可以“12321”概念体系为抓手，从整体上理解和把握这一思想体系。具体来说，第一个“1”是指一个根本目标，即以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴。“2”是指“两制”，分别表示坚持完善社会主义基本经济制度和建设更高水平的市场经济体制。“3”是指“三新”，即准确把握新发展阶段，深入贯彻新发展理念，加快构建新发展格局。随后的“2”是指“双高”，即推动经济高质量发展，以人口高质量发展支撑中国式现代化。最后一个“1”是指一个根本遵循，即始终坚持以人民为中心的发展思想。 以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴 习近平总书记在党的二十大报告中指出，从现在起，中国共产党的中心任务就是团结带领全国各族人民全面建成社会主义现代化强国、实现第二个百年奋斗目标，以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴。这一表述鲜明提出了新时代新征程中国共产党的使命任务和根本目标，指出中国式现代化是实现中华民族伟大复兴的途径，从而把中国式现代化提到了根本性发展战略的高度。 以习近平同志为核心的党中央以“两个十五年”规划了全面建成社会主义现代化强国的宏观蓝图：从二〇二〇年到二〇三五年，在全面建成小康社会的基础上，再奋斗十五年，基本实现社会主义现代化；从二〇三五年到本世纪中叶，在基本实现现代化的基础上，再奋斗十五年，把我国建成富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国。这一战略部署，清晰擘画了全面建成社会主义现代化强国、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的时间表和路线图，为当前和今后一个时期我国发展指明了方向。 世界上既不存在定于一尊的现代化模式，也不存在放之四海而皆准的现代化标准。对于我国这样一个社会主义大国来说，全面建设社会主义现代化国家，全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，必须走一条中国式现代化道路。党的二十大报告指出，中国式现代化，就其特征而言，既有各国现代化的共同特征，更有基于自己国情的中国特色。中国式现代化道路的本质要求则是：坚持中国共产党领导，坚持中国特色社会主义，实现高质量发展，发展全过程人民民主，丰富人民精神世界，实现全体人民共同富裕，促进人与自然和谐共生，推动构建人类命运共同体，创造人类文明新形态。 总的来看，以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴，是习近平经济思想对中国特色社会主义政治经济学的原创性贡献，不仅极大丰富了社会主义现代化理论，同时也为我国实现第二个百年奋斗目标和中华民族伟大复兴中国梦，提供了科学的方向指引和路径选择。 坚持“两个毫不动摇” 正确处理政府与市场关系 制度和体制建设是解决发展过程中出现的各种问题的治本之策。党的十九届四中全会提出：坚持公有制为主体、多种所有制经济共同发展和按劳分配为主体、多种分配方式并存，把社会主义制度和市场经济有机结合起来，不断解放和发展社会生产力的显著优势。明确社会主义基本经济制度包括生产资料所有制、收入分配制度以及市场经济体制三个方面，旗帜鲜明地强调必须坚持社会主义基本经济制度，是习近平经济思想的重大原创性贡献，也是中国特色社会主义政治经济学的重大理论特征。 坚持完善基本经济制度必须坚持公有制为主体、多种所有制经济共同发展。生产资料所有制是生产关系的核心，决定着社会的基本性质和发展方向。在我国，公有制经济和非公有制经济都是社会主义市场经济的重要组成部分，都是我国经济社会发展的重要基础。我国社会制度的社会主义性质决定了我们必须毫不动摇地坚持公有制为主体、国有经济为主导、不断发展壮大国有经济；我国处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段的基本国情，决定了我们必须毫不动摇地鼓励、支持、引导非公有制经济的发展。两者统一于整个社会主义初级阶段，缺一不可。 坚持完善基本经济制度必须坚持按劳分配为主体、多种分配方式并存。马克思主义政治经济学认为，消费资料的任何一种分配，都不过是生产条件本身分配的结果；而生产条件的分配，则表现生产方式本身的性质。我国生产资料公有制的主体地位决定了我们必须坚持按劳分配原则；由于社会主义初级阶段非公有制经济的存在和发展，我国还必须承认并保护生产要素所有者凭借要素所有权获得报酬的权利。这一分配制度有利于调动广大劳动者和各种生产要素所有者的生产经营积极性，有利于实现公平和效率的有机统一，有利于促进中国特色社会主义的发展。 坚持完善基本经济制度必须把社会主义制度和市场经济有机结合起来。社会主义市场经济是中国共产党和中国人民的伟大创造。改革开放以来，在理论上将“经济体制”与“经济制度”分置，有力地推动了社会主义市场经济体制的建立和完善。社会主义市场经济体制已成为社会主义基本经济制度的重要组成部分，“经济体制”和“经济制度”两者重新归为一体。把市场经济体制与社会主义基本经济制度有机结合是一项复杂的系统工程。习近平总书记指出，坚持社会主义市场经济改革方向，核心问题是处理好政府和市场的关系，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用和更好发挥政府作用。这是我们党在理论和实践上的又一重大推进。我们要坚持辩证法、两点论，继续在社会主义基本制度与市场经济的结合上下功夫，把两方面优势都发挥好，既要“有效的市场”，也要“有为的政府”，努力在实践中破解这道经济学上的世界性难题。 把握新阶段 贯彻新理念 构建新格局 把握新发展阶段、贯彻新发展理念、构建新发展格局，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央统筹中华民族伟大复兴战略全局和世界百年未有之大变局，与时俱进提升我国经济发展水平、塑造我国国际经济合作和竞争新优势作出的重大战略判断和战略抉择，反映了我们党对我国经济发展规律的新认识，丰富和发展了中国特色社会主义政治经济学。 进入新发展阶段明确了我国发展的历史方位。习近平总书记明确指出，党的十九届五中全会提出，全面建成小康社会、实现第一个百年奋斗目标之后，我们要乘势而上开启全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程、向第二个百年奋斗目标进军，这标志着我国进入了一个新发展阶段。一方面，我们完成了全面建成小康社会的第一个百年目标，正处在两个百年目标的关键历史节点上。另一方面，我国面临着经济增速下降的新常态，迫切需要转换经济增长动能，转变经济发展模式。两个方面因素标志着社会主义初级阶段进入新的发展阶段，这构成了贯彻新发展理念、构建新发展格局的现实依据。 贯彻新发展理念明确了我国现代化建设的指导原则。理念是行动的先导，一定的发展实践都是由一定的发展理念来引领的。党的十八大以来，我们党对经济形势进行科学判断，对经济社会发展提出了许多重大理论和理念，对发展理念和思路作出及时调整，其中新发展理念是最重要、最主要的。习近平总书记强调，新时代抓发展，必须更加突出发展理念，坚定不移贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的新发展理念。新发展理念是从我国发展实践中提炼出来的规律性认识，是习近平经济思想的重要理论成果，为把握新发展阶段、构建新发展格局提供了行动指南。完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，要注意从根本宗旨、问题导向和忧患意识三个方面对其加以把握。其中特别需要强调的是第三点，随着我国社会主要矛盾变化和国际力量对比深刻调整，我国发展面临的内外部风险空前上升。从忧患意识把握新发展理念，就是要牢固树立安全发展理念，将统筹发展和安全作为我国经济发展的重要保障。这是以习近平同志为核心的党中央立足我国经济发展面临的国际国内环境变化，对发展理念和思路作出的及时调整和重要创新。 构建新发展格局明确了我国经济现代化的路径选择。当今世界正经历百年未有之大变局，我国发展面临着前所未有的复杂环境。2020年4月，在中央财经委员会第七次会议上，习近平总书记提出要构建以国内大循环为主体、国内国际双循环相互促进的新发展格局。党的十九届五中全会进一步将其作为我国实施“十四五”规划的关键内容之一，并将构建新发展格局作为实现2035年远景目标的重要举措，提出要把形成强大国内市场和建设贸易强国两者统一起来。构建新发展格局，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央根据我国发展阶段、环境、条件变化，特别是基于我国比较优势变化，审时度势作出的重大决策，是新发展阶段要着力推动完成的重大历史任务，也是贯彻新发展理念的重大举措。 协同推进经济高质量发展和人口高质量发展 发展是党执政兴国的第一要务，是解决中国所有问题的关键。中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我国经济已由高速增长阶段转向高质量发展阶段，正处在转变发展方式、优化经济结构、转换增长动力的攻关期。具体来说，推动高质量发展，内在地包含着两个维度的目标和要求。 一是推动经济高质量发展。习近平总书记指出，高质量发展，就是能够很好满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要的发展，是体现新发展理念的发展，是创新成为第一动力、协调成为内生特点、绿色成为普遍形态、开放成为必由之路、共享成为根本目的的发展。推动经济高质量发展，要求将供给侧结构性改革和需求侧管理结合起来。党的十九届五中全会阐释了供给侧结构性改革和需求侧管理的辩证关系：坚持扩大内需这个战略基点，加快培育完整内需体系，把实施扩大内需战略同深化供给侧结构性改革有机结合起来，以创新驱动、高质量供给引领和创造新需求。这表明，习近平经济思想抓住供给和需求两方面特点，明确提出供给侧进行“改革”和需求侧实施“管理”的经济发展思路，把推动经济高质量发展的政策举措落到实处。 二是推动人口高质量发展。在马克思主义政治经济学看来，生产资料和劳动力是物质生产活动的两个基本要素，生产过程就是生产资料和劳动力的结合过程。其中，劳动力是生产要素中最具能动性的要素，是经济发展最重要的推动因素。也是在这个意义上，人口问题始终是我国面临的全局性、长期性、战略性问题，人口发展是关系中华民族伟大复兴的大事。当前，我国人口发展呈少子化、老龄化、区域人口增减分化的趋势性特征。对此，习近平总书记在二十届中央财经委员会第一次会议上，提出了“以人口高质量发展支撑中国式现代化”的重要论断和要求。推动人口高质量发展，要求完善新时代人口发展战略，认识、适应、引领人口发展新常态，着力提高人口整体素质，努力保持适度生育水平和人口规模，加快塑造素质优良、总量充裕、结构优化、分布合理的现代化人力资源，以人口高质量发展支撑中国式现代化。这是以习近平同志为核心的党中央立足于我国人口发展新形势，着力促进人口长期均衡发展做出的重大部署，也是习近平经济思想在高质量发展问题上的进一步丰富和发展。 坚持以人民为中心的发展思想 人民性是马克思主义最鲜明的品格。马克思主义经典作家明确指出，无产阶级的运动是绝大多数人的、为绝大多数人谋利益的独立的运动。在未来社会，生产将以所有的人富裕为目的。将人本身及其需要作为生产目的，是社会主义制度与资本主义制度的根本区别。始终同人民在一起，为人民利益而奋斗，是马克思主义政党同其他政党的根本区别。 党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央明确提出了坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，把增进人民福祉、促进人的全面发展、朝着共同富裕方向稳步前进作为经济发展的出发点和落脚点。深刻认识社会主义生产目的，将以人民为中心的发展思想作为我国经济社会发展的根本遵循，是习近平经济思想的重要理论贡献。2016年7月，习近平总书记在庆祝中国共产党成立95周年大会上的重要讲话中指出，我们要顺应人民群众对美好生活的向往，坚持以人民为中心的发展思想……使改革发展成果更多更公平惠及全体人民，朝着实现全体人民共同富裕的目标稳步迈进。在“人民对美好生活的向往”的概括下，习近平总书记进一步将社会主义生产目的具体化为教育、工作、收入、社会保障、医疗卫生服务、居住条件和环境几个方面，指出美好生活就是让人民群众拥有更好的教育、更稳定的工作、更满意的收入、更可靠的社会保障、更高水平的医疗服务、更舒适的居住条件、更优美的生产生活环境。 只有真正确立以人民为中心的根本立场，才能把社会主义生产目的具体化为各个方面的实践目标。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央始终将以人民为中心的发展思想作为部署经济工作、制定经济政策的根本遵循，着力解决发展的不平衡不充分问题，取得了打赢脱贫攻坚战，消除绝对贫困和区域性整体贫困，全面建成小康社会等一系列历史性成就。站在开启第二个百年奋斗目标的重大历史关头，我们仍要将以人民为中心的发展思想贯穿于经济社会发展全过程，这要求坚持中国共产党的领导，真正贯彻社会主义的生产目的，充分满足人民群众在物质生活、政治民主、精神文化、社会治理、生态环境等各个方面的需要，不断实现发展为了人民、发展依靠人民、发展成果由人民共享，让现代化建设成果更多更公平地惠及全体人民。总体来说，坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，深刻回答了为谁发展、依靠谁发展、发展成果由谁享有等重大理论问题，彰显了习近平经济思想以人为本、人民至上的根本价值取向，丰富发展了马克思主义政治经济学关于社会主义经济本质的理论。

0,"Since the 18th CPC National Congress, faced with the severe and complicated international situation and the arduous and heavy task of domestic reform, development and stabilization, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has put forward a series of new concepts, new ideas and new strategies to guide China's economic development to make historic achievements and changes, and has formed and developed Xi Jinping's Economic Thought in practice. Xi Jinping's Economic Thought is a product of the combination of Marxist political economy and the economic practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, which gives Marxist political economy a distinctive Chinese character, Chinese style and Chinese style. A complete and accurate grasp of Xi Jinping's economic thought, its core meaning, development history and logical structure is of great significance to the promotion of the development of the Chineseization of Marxist political economy, and to the correct understanding of a series of major theoretical and practical issues such as how to look at and what to do with China's economy. Profound response to the economic development of the new era How to see and how to do Xi Jinping's economic thought is an important part of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era, and at the same time, it is also the latest achievement of constantly exploring the new realm of Marxist political economy in contemporary China. Marxist political economy is one of the three major components of the Marxist theoretical system, and can be specifically divided into two categories, broad political economy and narrow political economy, according to the difference in the historical prescriptiveness of the objects of its study. Political economy in the broad sense refers to the political economy that is general and suitable for all social and economic forms of human beings. Political economy in the narrow sense refers to the political economy that is specific and reflects different social forms. Among them, the political economy that reflects the socialist mode of production and production relations is called socialist political economy. Since the reform and opening up, based on the refining and summarizing of the experience of socialist economic construction, socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics has come into being. Compared with socialist political economy, socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics is an individualized political economy that embodies ""country-specific specificity"". Since the 18th CPC National Congress, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has raised the guidelines, policies and initiatives of the Party's leadership in economic construction since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, to the theoretical and disciplinary level, and profoundly answered a series of major theoretical and practical questions on how to look at and how to work on the economic development in the new era, thus making great contributions to the innovation of the doctrine of Marxist political economy. innovation. In this process, Xi Jinping's economic thought has been gradually formed and systematically developed. Xi Jinping's economic thought has gone through a dynamic development process from formation to development to systematic presentation. Since the 18th CPC National Congress and the 2017 Central Economic Work Conference, Xi Jinping's economic thought has been in its formative stage.The 2017 Central Economic Work Conference clearly pointed out that in the past five years, we have adhered to the principle of observing the general situation, planning the overall situation, and working on practical matters, and successfully managed the overall situation of China's economic development, and Xi Jinping's economic thought of socialism of Chinese characteristics in the new era with the new development concept as the main content has been formed in practice. The meeting scientifically summarized the rich connotation of Xi Jinping's economic thought with the logical structure of ""1+7"", where ""1"" refers to the new development concept and ""7"" refers to the ""seven adherences"". The ""1"" refers to the New Development Concept, and the ""7"" refers to the ""Seven Insistences"".2021 In November 2021, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee considered and passed the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Significant Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party's Hundred Years of Struggle (hereinafter referred to as the ""Resolution""), which refined and summarized Xi Jinping's Economic Thought. The Resolution further summarizes the main contents of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in ten clear points, the seventh of which states that it is clear that it is necessary to adhere to and improve the basic economic system of socialism, enable the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation, give better play to the role of the government, grasp the new stage of development, and carry out innovation, coordination, green, openness, and sharing of resources. coordination, green, openness and sharing of the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern with the domestic macrocycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycle mutually reinforcing, promote high-quality development, and integrate development and security. The ""Seventh Clarity"" is a recapitulation and refinement of Xi Jinping's economic thought, reflecting the further enrichment and development of Xi Jinping's economic thought in the practice of this period since the 19th CPC National Congress.2022 In June, the Outline for the Study of Xi Jinping's Economic Thought (hereinafter referred to as ""the Outline"") was published, and Xi Jinping's economic thought was systematized and presented. systematized presentation. The Outline comprehensively reflects the original contributions of Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the field of economy, systematically explains the basic spirit, basic content, and basic requirements of Xi Jinping's Economic Thought, and completely outlines the theoretical outlines and ideological essentials of Xi Jinping's Economic Thought. The process of refining and summarizing the theory on the basis of practice is at the same time the process of the theory itself going deeper and deeper. The Outline realizes a systematic presentation of the whole theoretical picture of Xi Jinping's economic thought, and marks the elevation of Xi Jinping's economic thought to a new theoretical height. Xi Jinping's economic thought is a systematic theoretical whole, which can be understood and grasped from a holistic perspective by taking the ""12321"" conceptual system as a starting point. Specifically, the first ""1"" refers to a fundamental goal, i.e., to comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization. The first ""2"" refers to the ""two systems"", which means adherence to improving the basic socialist economic system and building a higher level of market economy, respectively. The ""3"" refers to the ""three new things"", i.e. accurately grasping the new stage of development, thoroughly implementing the new development concept, and accelerating the construction of a new development pattern. The subsequent ""2"" refers to ""double high"", i.e. promoting high-quality economic development and supporting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality population development. The last ""1"" refers to a fundamental guideline, that is, always adhere to the people-centered development ideology. Promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in the report of the 20th CPC National Congress that from now on, the central task of the CPC is to unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups to build a strong socialist modernized country in a comprehensive manner, to achieve the second hundred-year goal, and to promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization in an all-round way. This statement clearly puts forward the mission and fundamental goal of the CPC in the new era and new journey, and points out that Chinese-style modernization is the way to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, thus raising Chinese-style modernization to the height of a fundamental development strategy. The CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has planned a macro blueprint for building a strong socialist modernization country in a comprehensive manner with ""two 15-year periods"": from 2020 to 2035, on the basis of building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects, the CPC Central Committee will strive for another 15 years to basically realize socialist modernization; and from 2035 to mid-century, on the basis of basically realizing modernization, it will strive for another 15 years to basically realize socialist modernization. From 2035 to the middle of this century, on the basis of basic modernization, we will struggle for another fifteen years to build our country into a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power. This strategic plan clearly breaks down the timetable and roadmap for comprehensively building a socialist modernized powerhouse and comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, pointing out the direction of China's development in the current and future periods. In the world, there is neither a single model of modernization nor a standard of modernization that is universally applicable. For a large socialist country like China, it is necessary to take a Chinese-style modernization path to comprehensively build a modern socialist country and comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The report of the twentieth CPC National Congress points out that Chinese-style modernization, in terms of its characteristics, has the common features of modernization in all countries, but it also has Chinese characteristics based on its own national conditions. The essential requirements of Chinese-style modernization are: adherence to the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), adherence to socialism with Chinese characteristics, realization of high-quality development, development of people's democracy in the whole process, enrichment of the people's spiritual world, realization of the common wealth of all the people, promotion of harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature, promotion of the building of a community of shared destiny for mankind, and creation of a new form of human civilization. On the whole, promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization is an original contribution of Xi Jinping's economic thought to socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics, which not only greatly enriches the theory of socialist modernization, but also provides scientific guidance and path choice for China to achieve the second hundred-year goal and the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Adhering to the ""Two Unwavering Principles"" and Correctly Handling the Relationship between the Government and the Market Institutions and institution-building are the fundamental solutions to various problems that arise in the course of development. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee put forward the significant advantages of adhering to the public ownership system as the mainstay, the common development of multiple ownership economies, and the co-existence of distribution according to labor and multiple distribution methods, organically combining the socialist system and the market economy, and continuously liberating and developing the productive forces of society. Clarifying that the basic socialist economic system includes three aspects: the ownership system of the means of production, the income distribution system, and the market economic system, and emphasizing clearly that the basic socialist economic system must be adhered to, is a major original contribution of Xi Jinping's economic thought, and a major theoretical feature of socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics. Adherence to the improvement of the basic economic system must insist on the public ownership system as the mainstay and the common development of multiple ownership economies. Ownership of the means of production is the core of the relations of production, determining the basic nature of society and the direction of development. In our country, both the publicly-owned economy and the non-publicly-owned economy are important components of the socialist market economy, and both are an important foundation for our economic and social development. The socialist nature of China's social system determines that we must unswervingly adhere to the public system as the mainstay, the state-owned economy as the dominant one, and continuously develop and expand the state-owned economy; China's basic national conditions, which are at the primary stage of socialism and will be in it for a long time, determines that we must unswervingly encourage, support, and guide the development of non-publicly owned economy. The two are united throughout the primary stage of socialism, and one is indispensable. Adherence to the improvement of the basic economic system must insist that distribution according to labor be the mainstay and that a variety of distribution methods coexist. Marxist political economy holds that any kind of distribution of the means of consumption is but the result of the distribution of the conditions of production itself; and the distribution of the conditions of production expresses the nature of the mode of production itself. The dominant position of public ownership of the means of production in China determines that we must adhere to the principle of distribution according to work; because of the existence and development of the non-publicly owned economy at the primary stage of socialism, our country must also recognize and protect the right of the owners of the factors of production to be remunerated on the basis of their ownership of the factors. This distribution system is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and the owners of the various factors of production for production and operation, and is conducive to realizing the organic unity of fairness and efficiency and to promoting the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Adherence to improving the basic economic system must organically combine the socialist system with the market economy. The socialist market economy is a great creation of the CPC and the Chinese people. Since the reform and opening up, the theoretical separation of the ""economic system"" from the ""economic system"" has given a strong impetus to the establishment and improvement of the socialist market economic system. The socialist market economic system has become an important part of the basic socialist economic system, and the ""economic system"" and ""economic system"" have been reorganized into one. Organically integrating the market economy system with the basic socialist economic system is a complex systematic project. General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that the core issue in adhering to the direction of socialist market economy reform is to deal with the relationship between the government and the market, so as to make the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and give better play to the role of the government. This is another major advance in theory and practice for our Party. We should adhere to the dialectic and two-point theory, continue to work on the combination of the basic socialist system and the market economy, give good play to the advantages of both aspects, and strive to crack the economics of this world-wide problem in practice by having an ""effective market"" as well as an ""active government"". We will strive to solve this worldwide problem of economics in practice. Grasping the new stage, implementing the new concept, and building a new pattern Grasping the new stage of development, implementing the new development concept, and building a new pattern of development are the major strategic judgments and strategic choices made by the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to integrate the overall situation of the strategy for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with the great changes that have not been seen in the world for a hundred years, to upgrade China's economic development in the light of the times, and to shape China's new advantages in international economic cooperation and competition. The Party's new understanding of the laws of China's economic development has enriched and developed socialist political economy with Chinese characteristics. Entering a new stage of development clarifies the historical orientation of China's development. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee has made it clear that after building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieving the first hundred-year goal, we have to take advantage of the momentum to start a new journey to build a socialist modernized country in all respects and march towards the second hundred-year goal, which marks the entry of China into a new stage of development. On the one hand, we have accomplished the first hundred-year goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and are at the critical historical juncture of the two hundred-year goals. On the other hand, China is facing a new normal of declining economic growth, and there is an urgent need to convert the economic growth momentum and change the mode of economic development. The two factors mark the entry of the primary stage of socialism into a new stage of development, which constitutes a realistic basis for implementing the new development concept and building a new development pattern. Implementing the new development concept has clarified the guiding principles of China's modernization. Idea is the forerunner of action, and certain development practices are all led by certain development ideas. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has made scientific judgment on the economic situation, put forward many major theories and concepts on economic and social development, and made timely adjustments to development concepts and ideas, of which the new development concept is the most important and major one. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in order to grasp development in the new era, it is necessary to give more prominence to the concept of development and unswervingly implement the new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing. The new development concept is a regular understanding distilled from China's development practice, and is an important theoretical outcome of Xi Jinping's economic thought, which provides a guide to action for grasping the new stage of development and constructing a new development pattern. To implement the new development concept completely, accurately and comprehensively, attention should be paid to grasping it from three aspects: fundamental purpose, problem orientation and sense of worry. The third aspect that needs to be particularly emphasized is that, with the change of the main contradiction in China's society and the profound adjustment of the international balance of power, China's development is facing an unprecedented rise in internal and external risks. To grasp the new development concept from the sense of worry is to firmly establish the concept of safe development, and to take the integration of development and safety as an important guarantee for China's economic development. This is the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, based on the changes in the international and domestic environment faced by China's economic development, the development concept and ideas to make timely adjustments and important innovations. Constructing a new development pattern clarifies the path choice for China's economic modernization. Today, the world is experiencing a great change that has not been seen in a hundred years, and China's development is facing an unprecedentedly complex environment.In April 2020, at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed to build a new development pattern with the domestic macrocycle as the main body, and the domestic and international double cycle promoting each other. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee further made it one of the key elements of China's 14th Five-Year Plan, and made the construction of a new development pattern an important initiative for realizing the vision of 2035, proposing to unify the formation of a strong domestic market and the building of a strong trading nation. Constructing a new development pattern is a major decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, based on the changes in China's development stage, environment and conditions, especially on the changes in China's comparative advantages, and is a major historical task to be accomplished during the new development stage, as well as a major initiative to implement the new development concept. Synergizing the promotion of high-quality economic development and high-quality population development Development is the first priority of the Party in ruling and developing the country, and is the key to solving all of China's problems. As socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, China's economy has shifted from the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality development, and is at a critical stage of transforming the mode of development, optimizing the economic structure, and transforming the growth momentum. Specifically, the promotion of high-quality development inherently contains two dimensions of goals and requirements. The first is to promote high-quality economic development. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that high-quality development is development that can well meet the people's growing needs for a better life, development that embodies the new development concept, and development in which innovation becomes the first driving force, coordination becomes an endogenous feature, green becomes a universal pattern, openness becomes the way to go, and sharing becomes the fundamental purpose. Promoting high-quality economic development requires combining supply-side structural reform and demand-side management. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee explained the dialectical relationship between supply-side structural reform and demand-side management: adhere to the strategic base of expanding domestic demand, accelerate the cultivation of a complete system of domestic demand, organically combine the implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand with the deepening of the supply-side structural reform, and lead and create new demand with innovation-driven, high-quality supply. This shows that Xi Jinping's economic thinking has seized the characteristics of both supply and demand, clearly put forward the economic development idea of ""reform"" on the supply side and ""management"" on the demand side, and put the policies and initiatives of promoting high-quality economic development into practice. The second is to promote the high-quality development of the population. In the view of Marxist political economy, means of production and labor force are the two basic elements of material production activities, the production process is the combination of means of production and labor force. Among them, labor force is the most dynamic of the factors of production, and is the most important driving factor for economic development. It is also in this sense that the population issue has always been an overall, long-term and strategic issue facing our country, and population development is a major event related to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At present, China's population development is characterized by the trend of childlessness, aging, and regional population growth and decline. In this regard, General Secretary Xi Jinping, at the first meeting of the 20th Central Financial and Economic Commission, put forward the important assertion and requirement of ""supporting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality population development"". Promoting high-quality population development requires improving the population development strategy for the new era, understanding, adapting to and leading the new normal of population development, focusing on improving the overall quality of the population, striving to maintain an appropriate fertility level and population size, and accelerating the shaping of modern human resources that are of excellent quality, abundant in total quantity, with an optimized structure and a reasonable distribution, so as to support Chinese modernization with high-quality population development. This is a major deployment made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, based on the new situation of China's population development and focusing on promoting the long-term balanced development of the population, and is also a further enrichment and development of Xi Jinping's economic thought on the issue of high-quality development. Adhere to the people-centered development ideology Peoplehood is the most distinctive character of Marxism. The classic Marxist writers clearly pointed out that the movement of the proletariat is an independent movement of the vast majority of the people and for the benefit of the vast majority of the people. In the future society, production will be aimed at the enrichment of all people. Making people themselves and their needs the purpose of production is the fundamental difference between the socialist system and the capitalist system. Always being with the people and fighting for their interests is the fundamental difference between Marxist parties and other parties. Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has clearly put forward the idea of adhering to people-centered development, and has made the enhancement of the people's well-being, the promotion of all-around human development, and the steady progress toward common prosperity the starting and ending point of economic development. A deep understanding of the purpose of socialist production and making the people-centered development idea the fundamental guideline for China's economic and social development is an important theoretical contribution of Xi Jinping's economic thought.In July 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in an important speech at a conference celebrating the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), that we have to respond to the people's aspirations for a better life and adhere to the people-centered development idea ...... make the fruits of reform and development benefit all people more and more equitably, and make steady progress toward the goal of realizing the common prosperity of all people. Under the generalization of ""the people's aspiration for a better life,"" General Secretary Xi Jinping further crystallized the purpose of socialist production into several aspects, including education, work, income, social security, medical and health services, living conditions and the environment, pointing out that a better life means letting the masses of the people have a better education, a more stable job, a more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, and a better living environment. income, more reliable social security, a higher level of medical services, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful production and living environment. Only by truly establishing the fundamental position of putting the people at the center can the purpose of socialist production be concretized into practical goals in all aspects. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has always taken the people-centered development ideology as the fundamental guideline for deploying economic work and formulating economic policies, and has focused on solving the problem of imbalance and inadequacy of development, resulting in a series of historic achievements, such as winning the battle against poverty, eliminating absolute poverty and regional poverty as a whole, and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Standing at the major historical juncture of opening the second hundred-year goal, we still need to carry the people-centered development ideology throughout the entire process of economic and social development, which requires adhering to the leadership of the CPC, genuinely carrying out the socialist purpose of production, and fully satisfying the needs of the people in all aspects of material life, political democracy, spiritual culture, social governance, and the ecological environment, so as to continually realize that development is for the people, development relies on the people, and the fruits of development are achieved by the people. development for the sake of the people, development relying on the people, and the fruits of development being shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit all the people in a greater and fairer way. On the whole, adhering to the people-centered development idea has profoundly answered the major theoretical questions of for whom development is to be carried out, on whom development depends, and by whom the fruits of development are to be enjoyed, highlighting the fundamental value orientation of Xi Jinping's economic thought of putting people first and putting people first, and enriched and developed the theory of socialist economic nature in Marxist political economy. (The author is a professor at the School of Marxism of Wuhan University; a doctoral candidate at the School of Marxism of Wuhan University)","The article elaborates on Xi Jinping's Economic Thought as a significant part of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, developed in response to the complex international situation and the demanding tasks of domestic reform, development, and stability since the 18th CPC National Congress. Xi Jinping's Economic Thought integrates Marxist political economy with the economic practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, providing it with a distinctive Chinese identity, style, and manner. This thought represents the latest exploration in the realm of Marxist political economy within contemporary China, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of its core essence, developmental history, and logical structure for promoting the sinicization of Marxist political economy and accurately addressing major theoretical and practical economic issues.

Key points of the article include:

- **Formation and Evolution**: Xi Jinping's Economic Thought has developed through stages, from its initial formation to systematic elaboration, culminating in a coherent theoretical framework that addresses how to view and manage China's economy in the new era.

- **Core Elements**: The thought is summarized through a ""12321"" conceptual system, encompassing one fundamental goal (the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization), two systems (improving the socialist economic system and developing a high-level market economy), three new aspects (grasping the new development stage, implementing the new development concept, constructing a new development pattern), two ""highs"" (promoting high-quality economic development and supporting it with high-quality population development), and one fundamental guideline (adhering to the people-centered development ideology).

- **Significance**: Xi Jinping's Economic Thought is pivotal for promoting high-quality development, addressing the relationship between the government and the market, and understanding the strategic choices for China's modernization. It also highlights the importance of adhering to the socialist economic system, enhancing cultural self-confidence, and ensuring that development benefits all people equitably.

In essence, the article underscores Xi Jinping's Economic Thought as a comprehensive guide for China's economic policy and strategy, rooted in Marxist theory yet distinctly adapted to China's specific conditions and challenges in the new era. It calls for the thought to be fully understood and applied in practice to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation and to address the complex economic challenges facing China today."

Some things rely solely on personal power to do, it is likely to need to spend a lot of time, energy, but not necessarily achieve the desired results. Good use of external forces, can often get twice the result with half the effort, so as to better solve the problem and achieve the goal.

These are good at using natural conditions These are all examples of the wisdom of utilizing natural conditions to help oneself. Know how to cooperate is also a ""good fake in things"", relying on their own alone can only be a drop in the bucket, set the wisdom and strength of the crowd will be able to overcome all the difficulties of the formation of a strong fighting force and cohesion. The majority of officers and soldiers should always be of one mind, work together, in an atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance to unite the powerful force of the army. Also good at learning from the lessons of others. Everyone's experience is limited, the lessons of others is that we lack or have not experienced, can be cited for their own use, as their own success towards the ""paving stones"", to avoid failure of the ""mirror"". As Newton said, ""I see far because I stand on the shoulders of giants"". The reason why Newton was able to make great scientific achievements is very important because he drew on the experience, reasoning and assertions of many predecessors. By learning from the lessons of others, so that they take less detours, fewer mistakes, borrowing wisdom to become a trend, borrowing the power of the industry, the so-called ""the stone of other mountains, can attack jade"" is the reason.

We fly with the help of warplanes, the use of submarines to the sea, with the help of combat vehicles a thousand miles a day ...... can say, can not be good fake in things, will not fake things to seek victory, itself is the embodiment of combat effectiveness.

At the same time to realize that the success of things, external objects are only auxiliary, the decisive factor is still in their own. Only their own strong enough, properly supplemented by external objects, in order to achieve the finishing touch, the icing on the cake effect. The majority of officers and soldiers should give full play to the subjective initiative, in constantly improving their own ability to enhance their own quality at the same time, enhance the ""good fake in things"" skills, good at letting foreign objects for my use, for the cause of the strong army to contribute to the strength of the force.","The article ""The Way to Success of 'Good Falsehood'"" by Zhao Minghui highlights the importance of utilizing natural conditions, learning from others' experiences, and embracing new innovations to achieve success. It emphasizes that relying solely on personal power can be both time-consuming and exhausting, and may not always yield desired results. By harnessing external forces, one can achieve greater results with less effort.

The use of external factors, such as natural conditions, other people's experience, and new technology, is referred to as ""the good use of falsehood."" This approach can lead to faster and more efficient success. It further emphasizes that the key to success remains within oneself, and that one must strengthen their own abilities while skillfully utilizing external factors to enhance the overall outcome.

军事论坛丨透视外军军事教育发展的内在逻辑 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：陈乃利  卫明 责任编辑：孙智英 2023-10-17 06:51:29 0,透视外军军事教育发展的内在逻辑 ■陈乃利  卫明 引言 规律反映事物内部和外部的基本联系，决定事物必然的发展趋向。党的二十大报告明确提出要“建强新型军事人才培养体系”。推进新时代军事教育高质量发展，必须深刻认识、准确把握、科学运用军事教育内在逻辑，注重以开放思维分析研究国外军事教育做法，归纳其普遍认识和有益经验，在比肩一流中借鉴一流、建设一流。 服务政治的育人要求是军事教育发展的根本要求 教育是国家意识形态重要组成部分，是国家权力体现和行使，也是国家治理重要手段。各国的教育，包括军事教育，无一不有着鲜明的政治属性。 研究发现，西方国家军队非常强调军事教育要服从和服务于政治要求。他们将“为谁打仗”“以什么姿态从军”等理念的培养有效融入教育教学活动和社会生活实践，在潜移默化中完成国家意识形态和政治制度教育。比如，有的西方国家军事院校的大纲和学习指导中，虽然强调所设课程“不能预设立场，不宣扬、也不强制学员选择价值观”，但这种要求往往仅停留在学术研究层面。审视其教学资料和组织过程，课程教学中的意识形态“标签”随处可见。其联合参谋培训班中的演习想定，背景设置为“自由民主世界受到了严重威胁”，以强调出兵动武的正当合法性；在课题研讨教学中，设置“自由价值观面临的主要威胁”议题；学术导师组织讨论，也往往会从价值观的角度把世界主要国家“划线”“归堆”，然后引导学员批判那些与西方制度不同的国家，并刻意回避西方社会民粹主义抬头、社会治理能力退步等现实。美、英、法等国军队院校还注重通过军人的精英礼仪教育、荣誉准则教育，以及配合的宗教教育，为其军人履职打牢思想基础。 培养什么人、怎样培养人、为谁培养人，是教育的根本问题。军事教育在任何时候都要坚持把讲政治放在第一位，培养的人在政治上不能有半点偏差。我们要坚持立德树人，加强政治引领，把思想政治教育贯穿军事教育全过程，把政治建军要求贯彻到军事教育全部实践中。 向战为战的教育理念是军事教育发展的目标指向 理念是行动的先导。教育理念反映的是教育的本质特点，从根本上回答为什么办教育。军事教育是战争教育，军事教育的目的是为战争培养人才。离开了战争，军事教育就失去了原有的意义，培养的人就失去了使用的价值。军事教育理念是否得当，从根本上决定教育的成效乃至成败。 俄军坚持按照实战标准开展军事教育培训。俄总参军事学院注重紧贴部队战备训练，部队怎么干，学院理论课就怎么讲，实践课就怎么练。比如，“军事指挥”和“战役法”两门课程作为教学设计的核心板块，都是基于部队实践设计教学目标、选择教学内容，而且在实践教学环节，还要组织学员以下一任职岗位身份参加俄军总参谋部和各军区组织的联合演习。这些做法确保了学员能较快适应岗位任职需要，大幅提升了人才培养效益。德军院校教育以培养能够胜任部队各类岗位的人员为目的，具有明确的实战导向性。比如，德国联邦国防军指挥学院的实践性教学约占总教学时间的60%左右，学员完成基础科目学习并考试合格后，必须在各级司令部机关实习一年，才能回到学院继续参加应用科目的学习。这种理论与实践相结合的教学理念，有助于学员深化对课堂所学知识的理解，有效地把教育训练与战争实践紧密联系起来。 现代战争具有明显的不确定性、突发性、随机性和复杂性。推进军事教育高质量发展，要坚持向战为战的教育理念，把人才培养的战争需求搞清楚，把打仗人才的培养标准立起来，围绕实战搞教学，着眼打赢育人才，做到打仗需要什么就教什么、部队需要什么就练什么，才能推动院校同部队精准对接、课堂同战场紧密衔接，从而确保培养的人才符合打赢现代战争需要。 层次合理的院校体系是军事教育发展的基础支撑 院校教育是人才培养的主渠道，军队院校是开展军事教育的体制依托和基础支撑。纵观世界强国军队，普遍建有以高等教育为基础，以职业军事教育为重点，覆盖各领域各层级各类人员的军事教育培训体系，承担着军人职业生涯的全链路培训。 比如，美军现行的军队院校教育体系，包含了从任命前、初级军官、中级军官、高级军官到将官5个层级、累计10年以上的军事教育，各教育层级间相互衔接、循序渐进，与军官人才培养路径高度对应契合，涵盖了各专业门类军官全职业生涯的能力培养所需，为美军建设发展提供了人才保障。俄军实行任职前培训阶段、深造阶段和初、中、高3个等级的“两段三级”培训体制。俄总参军事学院培养高级军官；各军种军事学院、军事大学培养中级军官；高等军事学校和军事专科学校培养初级军官。各层级院校的培养目标、培训课程紧密衔接，其间穿插安排多次专业技能培训，对军官接续实施专业化、精准化培养。 在相对稳定中持续改革发展、在衔接贯通中接续培养人才，是军事教育发展的必然要求。推动军事教育高质量发展，要适应军事教育规律和人才成长规律，健全完善与时俱进、科学合理的军队院校教育体系，纵向上贯通初、中、高三级，横向上覆盖不同军兵种、不同领域、不同教育培训类型，全程衔接耦合军人职业发展路径，突出院校体系的整体性、协调性，为新型军事人才培养提供强有力的支撑。 专业化的师资力量是军事教育发展的人才保证 教育大计，教师为本。师资力量是提高人才培养质量的关键。只有高水平的师资，才能培养出高质量的人才。加强师资力量建设是军事教育领域最重要的一项基础性工作。这个基础夯得越实越牢，教育培训效益就越好，人才培养质量就越高。 日本自卫队院校注重根据学员培养需求，遴选最专业的师资。比如，日本防卫研究所的专业优势是安全保障、防卫政策研究，此类课程讲授主要由本所自身承担。除此以外，其他课程根据教学内容，在全国甚至全世界范围内遴选师资，包括陆、海、空自卫队参谋部的政策制定者、内阁官房、外务省等的政策制定者，地方大学或智库的专家学者等，有时还会聘请外国退役人员或相关领域知名专家，通过专业人教专业课，确保教学质量。英军院校积极拓宽引进渠道，除保留少量固定编制教员外，从初级院校到高级院校，大部分课程通过外请讲座方式讲授。比如英国联合指挥与参谋学院、皇家国防研究学院外请授课率分别高达50%、80%以上，这些受邀授课人员有的是本行业领域专家，有的是部队一线指挥员，有的是政府要员或国际知名企业高管。外请授课的共同特点是坚持专长任教，由理论原创者、作战亲历者、管理佼佼者来谈认识、教方法、传经验，高水平的师资力量保证了课程讲授质量，提升了学员对所学知识的深度理解力。 功以才成，业由才广。推进军事教育高质量发展，要在培养造就专业精湛的师资力量上下功夫，创新师资培训体系，规范教官选拔使用流程，精选多方优势力量，积极走开院校与部队、军内与军外交流合作路子，健全教育教学荣誉激励机制，把尊师重教落到实处，提升师资力量能力素质，才能为培养合格军事人才奠定坚实基础。 多元融合的教育资源是军事教育发展的重要保障 新型军事人才专业类型多、培养周期长，单纯依靠内部有限资源难以完成培养任务。现代军事教育对教育资源的理解不再局限于校内人员、设施、资金和教学科研成果的积累，而强调广泛争取和整合运用多方向多渠道优势资源，合理配置，深度挖潜，以实现教育效益的最大化。 打造没有围墙的军事教育，是世界强国军队的通行做法。俄军注重利用实际战场环境培养军事人才。自叙利亚战争爆发以来，俄军抓住难得的实战练兵机会，先后组织武装力量所属军事院校900余名教员和学员赴叙利亚战场实地参战，积累实战经验，更新教学方法，推动了俄军院校教学改革和新型军事人才培养。法军积极利用地方优势教育资源服务军事教育，将军事院校一些军地通用培训课程全部外包给地方院校或科研机构。比如，法国战争学院的谈判课程一般由巴黎高等商学院谈判与教学研究所承担，演讲艺术课程由巴黎演讲艺术学院承担，力求给学员提供最高水准的教学内容。 信息化智能化时代对人才能力素质结构、知识领域范围和思维层次水平提出了更高要求。在军事人才培养过程中，很多教育教学内容已远远超出本领域甚至超出军事领域范畴。推进军事教育高质量发展，要在教育资源融合使用上，坚持“请进来、走出去”“军校小舞台，社会大支撑”，充分统筹军内外、国内外优质教育资源，拓宽人才培养渠道，聚集育人合力，提升人才培养质量效益。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231019000332/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16259198.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231017003426/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16259198.html,2023-10-19 0:00:00,军事论坛丨透视外军军事教育发展的内在逻辑 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：陈乃利 卫明 责任编辑：孙智英 2023-10-17 06:51:29 0,"The internal logic of the development of foreign military education ■ Chen Naili Weiming Introduction Laws reflect the basic connection between the internal and external aspects of things, and determine the inevitable tendency of things to develop. The report of the 20th Party Congress clearly puts forward the need to ""build and strengthen a new type of military personnel training system"". To promote the high-quality development of military education in the new era, it is necessary to deeply understand, accurately grasp, and scientifically apply the internal logic of military education, focus on analyzing and researching the practices of foreign military education with an open mind, and summarize their general understanding and beneficial experience, so as to learn from the first-class and build the first-class in the first-class. The requirement of serving political education is the fundamental requirement for the development of military education Education is an important part of national ideology, the embodiment and exercise of state power, and an important means of national governance. Education in all countries, including military education, has distinct political attributes. Research has found that the armies of Western countries place great emphasis on the need for military education to be subordinate to and serve political requirements. They will ""for whom to fight"" ""with what posture from the military"" and other concepts of training effectively into the education and teaching activities and social life practices, in a subtle way to complete the national ideology and political system education. For example, in the syllabi and study guides of military academies in some Western countries, although it is emphasized that the curriculum ""should not be preconceived, nor promote or force students to choose values"", this requirement often remains only at the level of academic research. Looking at their teaching materials and organization, ideological ""labels"" can be seen everywhere in their courses. In the Joint Staff Training Course, the background of the exercise is set as ""the free and democratic world is under serious threat"" in order to emphasize the legitimacy of the use of force; in the seminar teaching, the topic of ""the main threats to liberal values"" is set; and the academic instructor Organize discussions, often from the perspective of values to the world's major countries ""line"" ""pile"", and then lead the students to criticize those countries that are different from the Western system, and deliberately avoid the rise of populism in Western societies, the regression of social governance capacity and other realities. Military academies in the U.S., U.K., and France also focus on laying a firm ideological foundation for their military personnel to perform their duties through elite etiquette education for military personnel, honor code education, and complementary religious education. What people to cultivate, how to cultivate people, and for whom to cultivate people is the fundamental issue of education. Military education should at all times insist on putting politics in the first place, and the people it trains should not have the slightest deviation in politics. We must adhere to the moral principle, strengthen the political leadership, the ideological and political education through the whole process of military education, and implement the political military requirements into all the practice of military education. The educational concept of war for war is the goal of the development of military education Idea is the forerunner of action. The concept of education reflects the essential characteristics of education, and fundamentally answers the question of why education should be organized. Military education is war education, the purpose of military education is to cultivate talents for the war. Leaving the war, military education will lose its original meaning, training people will lose the value of use. Whether the concept of military education is appropriate, fundamentally determines the effectiveness of education and even success or failure. The Russian army insists on carrying out military education and training in accordance with the standards of actual warfare. The Military Academy of the Russian General Staff focuses on keeping up with the troops' combat readiness and training, and how the troops do their jobs, how the theoretical classes of the Academy are conducted, and how the practical classes are practiced. For example, the ""Military Command"" and ""Battle Law"" courses, as the core of the teaching design, are based on the practice of the troops to design the teaching objectives and select the teaching content, and in the practice of teaching, but also to organize students to participate in the next posting status. In the course of the practical training, participants are also organized to take part in joint exercises organized by the General Staff of the Russian Army and the military districts in their capacity as the next in line of duty. These practices ensure that trainees can quickly adapt to the needs of their posts and greatly enhance the effectiveness of personnel training. The German military academy education to cultivate personnel capable of all types of positions in the army for the purpose, with a clear orientation to the actual combat. For example, the German Bundeswehr Command College of practical teaching accounted for about 60% of the total teaching time, students to complete the basic subjects of study and pass the examination, must be at all levels of command organs internship for one year before returning to the college to continue to participate in the study of the application of subjects. This teaching concept of combining theory and practice helps trainees deepen their understanding of what they have learned in the classroom and effectively links education and training closely with war practice. Modern war has obvious uncertainty, suddenness, randomness and complexity. To promote the high-quality development of military education, we must adhere to the concept of education to the war for the war, the training of talents to make clear the needs of the war, the training of talents to fight the war standard, teaching around the actual combat, focusing on win-win training of talents, to do what is needed to fight the war on what to teach the troops what they need on what to practice, in order to promote the institutions with the troops to accurately docking, classroom with the battlefield close connection, so as to ensure that training of talents to meet the needs of winning a modern war. Modern war needs. A reasonable institutional system is the basic support for the development of military education Institutional education is the main channel for talent training, and military colleges and universities are the institutional backing and basic support for the development of military education. Looking at the armies of the world's strongest countries, it is common to have a military education and training system based on higher education, with a focus on vocational military education, covering all fields and levels of personnel of all types, and undertaking the full chain of training for the career of military personnel. For example, the U.S. Army's current military academy education system includes five levels, from pre-appointment, junior officers, mid-level officers, senior officers to general officers, and a cumulative total of more than 10 years of military education, with each level of education connected to the other in a gradual and orderly manner, and with a high degree of correspondence to fit the path of officer training, covering all professional disciplines required for the training of officers' full-career capabilities, and providing a guarantee of talents for the construction and development of the U.S. Army. The Russian army has implemented a ""two-stage, three-stage"" training system that includes a pre-service training stage, a further training stage and three grades: junior, middle and senior. The Military Academy of the Russian General Staff trains senior officers; the military academies of the various branches of the armed forces and military universities train intermediate officers; and higher military schools and military colleges train junior officers. The training objectives and curricula of the institutions at each level are closely interlinked, with several interspersed training courses in specialized skills, so that officers are trained in a professional and precise manner. It is an inevitable requirement for the development of military education that reform and development be sustained in relative stability and that talents be cultivated successively in the context of articulation and coherence. To promote the high-quality development of military education, it is necessary to adapt to the laws of military education and the growth of talents, improve and perfect the education system of military colleges and universities that is up-to-date, scientific and reasonable, vertically through the junior, middle and senior levels, horizontally covering different military branches, different fields and different types of education and training, articulating and coupling the paths of career development of military personnel throughout the entire process, and highlighting the holistic and coordinated system of the colleges and universities, so as to provide a strong support for the cultivation of new types of military talents. Provide strong support. Specialized faculty is the talent guarantee for military education development. The teacher is the key to education. Teachers are the key to improving the quality of personnel training. Only high-level teachers can cultivate high-quality talents. Strengthening the construction of teachers is the most important basic work in the field of military education. The more solid and firm this foundation is, the better the benefits of education and training, and the higher the quality of personnel training. Japan's Self-Defense Forces institutions focus on the training needs of trainees, the selection of the most professional teachers. For example, the Japanese Defense Research Institute's professional strengths are security and defense policy research, and such courses are mainly taught by the Institute itself. In addition to this, other courses are taught in accordance with the content of the selection of teachers throughout the country and even around the world, including policy makers from the staff departments of the Self-Defense Forces of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, policy makers from the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and experts and scholars from local universities and think tanks, etc. In addition, sometimes retired foreign personnel or well-known experts in related fields are also recruited, so as to ensure the quality of the teaching through the teaching of specialized courses by specialized people. British military academies actively broaden the introduction of channels, in addition to retaining a small number of fixed establishment faculty, from junior to senior institutions, most of the courses are taught through external lectures. For example, the British Joint Command and Staff College and the Royal College of Defence Studies have invited lectures as high as 50% and more than 80% respectively, and some of these invited lecturers are experts in their own fields, some of them are first-line commanders of the army, and some of them are government officials or executives of internationally renowned enterprises. The common feature of the invited lecturers is to adhere to the specialties of teaching, by the theory of the original, combat experience, management leaders to talk about the understanding, teaching methods, experience, high level of faculty to ensure the quality of the course teaching, enhance the depth of understanding of the students of the knowledge they have learned. The success of the work to be accomplished, the industry by the talent wide. To promote the high-quality development of military education, we need to make efforts in training and creating professional and exquisite teachers, innovative teacher training system, standardize the process of selection and use of instructors, select the advantages of multiple strengths, and actively go away from the institution and the army, the military and the military exchanges and cooperation paths, and improve the education and teaching honor incentive mechanism, respect for teachers to put into practice, and enhance the competence of the teacher force in order to lay a solid foundation for the cultivation of qualified military personnel. A solid foundation can only be laid for the cultivation of qualified military personnel. Diversified integration of educational resources is an important guarantee for the development of military education New types of military personnel specialization, long training cycle, relying solely on limited internal resources is difficult to complete the training task. Modern military education on the understanding of educational resources is no longer limited to the school personnel, facilities, funds and the accumulation of teaching and research results, but emphasizes the extensive fight for and the integration of the use of multi-directional and multi-channel advantageous resources, rational allocation, in-depth tapping, in order to achieve the maximization of the benefits of education. Creating military education without walls is the common practice of the armies of the world's strongest countries. The Russian army focuses on utilizing the actual battlefield environment to cultivate military talents. Since the outbreak of the war in Syria, the Russian army has seized the rare opportunity of real-world training, and has organized more than 900 instructors and trainees of military colleges and universities belonging to the Armed Forces to go to the Syrian battlefield to participate in the war, to accumulate real-world experience, to update their teaching methods, and to promote the reform of the teaching of the Russian army colleges and universities and the training of new types of military personnel. The French army has actively utilized local advantageous educational resources to serve military education, and has outsourced some of the military academy's general training courses to local colleges and universities or scientific research institutions. For example, the negotiation courses of the French War College are generally undertaken by the Institute of Negotiation and Teaching of the Paris Higher School of Business, and the courses on the art of speech are undertaken by the Paris Academy of Speech, which strives to provide students with the highest level of teaching content. The era of informatization and intelligence has put forward higher requirements for the structure of talents' ability and quality, the scope of knowledge fields and the level of thinking. In the process of military personnel training, a lot of education and teaching content has gone far beyond the field or even beyond the military field. To promote the high-quality development of military education, we must adhere to the integration and use of educational resources, ""invite in, go out"", ""small stage in the military school, social support"", and fully integrate the military and domestic and foreign high-quality educational resources, to broaden the channels of talent cultivation, gather the synergies of education, and improve the quality and effectiveness of talent cultivation. In order to improve the quality and efficiency of talent training, the company has been working hard to improve the quality and efficiency of talent training.","This article discusses the internal logic of foreign military education and the need for deep understanding and scientific application of its general understanding and beneficial experience. It highlights that military education is a crucial aspect of national ideology and is closely related to other aspects of national policy. The article underscores the importance of hyper-political education, ensuring that the military personnel being trained remain completely aligned with the country's political and ideological frameworks. It also emphasizes the need for a strong educational concept that prioritizes war as the aim and goal of military education.

思想战线丨充分发挥政治工作生命线作用——学习《习近平强军思想学习纲要（2023年版）》 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：龙  凤 责任编辑：季鹏洋 2023-10-16 06:31:15 0,充分发挥政治工作生命线作用 ——学习《习近平强军思想学习纲要（2023年版）》 ■龙凤 政治工作永远是我军的生命线。政治工作是我军的看家本领，是我军的最大特色、最大优势，是我军同一切其他性质军队的最大区别，也是我军保持人民军队性质、宗旨、本色的重要保障。奋进新征程，如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标、加快把人民军队建成世界一流军队，必须充分发挥政治工作对强军兴军的生命线作用。 一 政治工作是我军的生命线，是我们党从领导人民军队建设实践中得出的科学结论，具有深厚的历史依据、理论依据和实践依据。 我军政治工作萌芽于大革命时期，创立于建军之初，奠基于古田会议，在实践中不断丰富发展。1932年7月，中共中央在给苏区中央局及苏区闽赣两省委的信中首次提出，“政治工作不是附带的，而是红军的生命线”。1954年，毛泽东同志在新中国成立后我军第一部政治工作条例送审稿上，亲笔写下“中国共产党在中国人民解放军中的政治工作是我军的生命线”。90多年来，政治工作始终贯穿人民军队建设、改革和军事斗争准备各环节，对确保我军从小到大、由弱到强，不断从胜利走向胜利起到了决定性作用。 马克思主义认为，社会存在决定社会意识，社会意识具有能动的反作用。军队政治工作的一个基本原则，就是用科学理论武装部队、教育官兵，提高官兵思想觉悟，使精神力量转化为推动军队建设的物质力量，转化为现实的战斗力。同时还要看到，决定战争胜负的最终因素是人。即使当今时代军事技术不断发展，信息化智能化武器大量涌现并广泛应用，但人的因素始终是第一位的、是起决定性作用的制胜因素。政治工作是提高官兵素质、促进人和武器最佳结合、赢得战争胜利的主要手段，离开政治工作就不可能有效发挥人的因素。 政治工作实质上是党领导和掌握军队的工作。我军是执行党的政治任务的武装集团，党对军队绝对领导是建军之本、强军之魂。我们党为牢牢掌握军队领导权和指挥权，建立了政治工作一整套组织领导体系及运行规范，这些是军队政治工作组织实施的制度依托，是党对军队绝对领导制度在军队政治工作领域的具体体现。党对军队的绝对领导，为发挥政治工作生命线作用奠定了制度基础、提供了制度保证，保证了我军在长期复杂斗争中始终沿着正确方向行动和战斗，使政治工作成为关系我军强弱胜败、生存发展的决定性因素。 二 党的十八大以来，我军政治工作在继承中加强，在创新中发展，充分发挥了政治工作的生命线作用。强军兴军实践充分表明，新时代军队政治工作只能加强不能削弱，只能前进不能停滞，只能积极作为不能被动应对，必须把握重点、全面加强。 在加强党的领导和党的建设中彰显生命线作用。党的领导和党的建设是我军建设的关键，关系强军事业兴衰成败。今年7月，习主席对全军党的建设会议作出重要指示，强调要持续推进全面从严治党、全面从严治军，着力解决各级党组织在坚持党对军队绝对领导、抓备战打仗能力、落实管党治党政治责任等方面存在的突出问题，为实现建军一百年奋斗目标提供坚强政治保证。政治工作必须紧紧扭住全面加强党的领导和党的建设这个根本，把铸牢军魂作为核心任务，持续用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想凝心铸魂，在聚焦备战打仗主责主业、集聚能打仗打胜仗的强大力量上，在坚持培养“四有”新时代革命军人、锻造“四铁”过硬部队上，充分发挥生命线作用，为有效履行使命任务提供坚强政治保证。 在全面提升部队战斗力上彰显生命线作用。军队是要打仗的，必须把战斗力标准牢固立起来。随着强军兴军步伐加快，部队演习演训、野外驻训等实战化军事训练已经成为常态，军事力量运用日益常态化多样化，有效应对科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，大力推进战训耦合、体系练兵、科技练兵，全面推进军事训练转型升级，需要政治工作围绕中心、服务大局，探索服务保障战斗力建设的作用机理，把政治工作贯穿到战斗力建设各环节，融入到军事斗争准备全过程。通过为战斗力生成提供精神动力、为战斗力发挥提供智力支持、为战斗力提升立起正确导向、为战斗力建设提供方向引领，充分彰显政治工作的生命线作用。 在全面加强军事治理上彰显生命线作用。全面加强军事治理是复杂的系统工程，涉及国防和军队建设方方面面。在军事系统运行日益复杂的情况下，如何增强整体性、协同性和高效能，需要进一步强化党对军队的绝对领导；军事治理不仅限于军队自身的治理，需要在党的集中统一领导下，汇聚全党全军全国各族人民的智慧力量；等等。这些都需要把政治工作融入到军事治理各方面、全过程，通过强有力的政治工作把方向、统力量、激活力，不断完善中国特色社会主义军事制度体系，使军事治理与国家治理体系和治理能力现代化相适应，使我国军事制度优势更好地转化为军事治理效能。 在确保人民军队政治本色上彰显生命线作用。人民军队的本色和作风源于党的本色和作风。我军通过开展革命的政治工作，把党的性质宗旨、本色作风植入广大官兵血脉，确保我军始终是无产阶级性质的新型人民军队。面对意识形态领域尖锐复杂的斗争形势，特别是敌对势力极力鼓吹“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”等错误政治观点的侵蚀影响；面对日益严峻的国家安全形势，艰巨繁重的练兵备战、军事斗争准备任务，必须保持人民军队的性质永远不变，老红军的传统永远不丢，艰苦奋斗的政治本色永远不改。政治工作必须以党的方向为方向，教育引导官兵确立崇高的理想信念、正确的价值取向、高尚的道德情操、严明的纪律观念，确保人民军队初心不改、本色不变。 三 发挥政治工作生命线作用是经验总结，更是实践课题。奋进新征程，军队政治工作必须把握核心任务，聚焦时代主题，不断实现创新突破和发展。 让生命线更有生命力，首要的就是坚持党对军队绝对领导。要扎实开展学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育，深化转化第一批主题教育成果，抓实抓细第二批主题教育，统筹抓好“学习强军思想、建功强军事业”教育实践活动，帮助官兵进一步筑牢听党指挥的思想政治根基。要持续抓好军委主席负责制学习教育，始终把贯彻军委主席负责制作为最高政治要求来遵循、作为最高政治纪律来严守，确保党对军队绝对领导直达基层、直达官兵。要着力增强各级党组织政治功能和组织功能，严肃党内政治生活，贯彻民主集中制，推动政治整训常态化制度化，提高高层党委把方向、谋大事、抓落实的本领，切实把每个基层党组织都锻造成为坚强战斗堡垒。 军队政治工作的时代主题是，紧紧围绕实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，为实现党在新时代的强军目标、把人民军队全面建成世界一流军队提供坚强政治保证。这一时代主题，深刻回答了新时代政治工作往哪前进、如何加强、怎么作为的根本问题，指明了政治工作在强军兴军中的方位和坐标，赋予了政治工作新的使命任务。政治工作必须紧紧聚焦这个时代主题来推进，着力把“四个带根本性的东西立起来”，着力构建新时代人民军队思想政治教育体系，着力繁荣发展强军文化，为实现中国梦强军梦提供可靠政治保证、强大精神动力、有力人才支撑。 习主席在古田全军政治工作会议上，对我军政治工作的优良传统作了系统概括，明确为“十一个坚持”。这些优良传统，是我军政治工作的根本原则和内容，是革命先辈们用鲜血和生命铸就的“真金”，是永不褪色的传家宝。政治工作要把学传统、爱传统、讲传统作为经常性工作，教育引导官兵从历史与现实的结合中感悟优良传统的时代价值，弘扬优良传统，做到倍加珍惜、牢牢坚持，让生命线不断线、接力传。 政治工作是做人的工作，必须结合官兵思想观念、价值取向、行为方式、精神文化需求等因素，有的放矢做工作，增强政治工作时代性和感召力。既要坚持政治工作根本原则和制度，又要积极推进政治工作思维理念、运行模式、指导方式、方法手段创新，确保政治工作与时代条件变化同步、我军使命任务拓展和官兵思想现状合拍。同时，科学把握信息网络时代政治工作的特点和规律，用好用活网络平台，推动政治工作传统优势与信息技术高度融合，进一步增强政治工作主动性和实效性。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231019000332/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16258875.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231016033732/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16258875.html,2023-10-19 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨To give full play to the role of the lifeline of political work--Study Xi Jinping's Outline for Learning Strong Military Thought (2023 Edition) Source: china military network - PLA Daily Author: Long Feng Editor in Chief: Ji Pengyang 2023-10-16 06:31:15 0,"Give full play to the role of political work as a lifeline - Study Xi Jinping's Outline for Learning Strong Military Thought (2023 Edition) ■ Longfeng Political work is always the lifeline of our army. Political work is the watchword of our army, the greatest feature and advantage of our army, the biggest difference between our army and all other armies of any nature, and an important guarantee for our army to maintain the nature, purpose, and character of the people's army. To advance in the new journey, realize the goal of building the army for 100 years on schedule, and accelerate the building of the people's army into a world-class army, we must give full play to the role of political work as the lifeline for strengthening and developing the army. Political work is the lifeblood of the army, a scientific conclusion drawn by the Party from the practice of leading the people's army construction, with a profound historical, theoretical and practical basis. The political work of our army sprouted in the Revolutionary period, was founded at the beginning of the army, laid the foundation at the Gutian Conference, and has been constantly enriched and developed in practice. in July 1932, the CPC Central Committee first put forward the idea that ""the political work is not incidental, but is the lifeblood of the Red Army"" in a letter to the Central Bureau of the Soviet Union and the Min-Gan Provincial Committees of the Soviet Union. in 1954, Comrade Mao Zedong made a statement at the founding of the new China, saying that the political work of the Red Army is not incidental, but is the lifeline of the Red Army. In 1954, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in his own handwriting, ""The political work of the Communist Party of China in the People's Liberation Army is the lifeblood of the Army"" on the draft of the first regulation on the political work of the People's Liberation Army after the founding of New China.For more than 90 years, the political work has always been carried out through the People's Army's construction, reform and preparation for military struggles, and has been instrumental in ensuring that the People's Liberation Army grows from a small to a big one and from weak to strong, It has played a decisive role in ensuring that our army grows from small to large, from weak to strong, and constantly moves from victory to victory. According to Marxism, social existence determines social consciousness, and social consciousness has a dynamic reaction. One of the basic principles of the political work of the army is to use scientific theories to educate officers and soldiers, to raise their ideological awareness, and to transform spiritual power into material power to promote the construction of the army, and to transform it into realistic combat power. At the same time, we must also see that the ultimate factor in deciding whether to win or lose a war is people. Even though the military technology of today's era continues to develop, information technology and intelligent weapons emerge and widely used, but the human factor is always the first, is the decisive role of the winning factor. Political work is the main means to improve the quality of officers and soldiers, promote the best combination of people and weapons, and win the war, and it is impossible to effectively play the human factor without political work. Political work is essentially the work of the Party in leading and mastering the army. Our army is an armed group that carries out the Party's political tasks, and the Party's absolute leadership of the army is the foundation for building the army and the soul for strengthening it. Our party in order to firmly grasp the leadership and command of the army, the establishment of the political work of a complete set of organization and leadership system and operation norms, these are the organization and implementation of the political work of the army system, is the party's absolute leadership of the army in the field of political work in the army's specific embodiment. The Party's absolute leadership of the army has laid the institutional foundation and provided institutional guarantee for the role of political work as a lifeline, ensuring that the army always acts and fights in the right direction in the long and complex struggle, and making political work a decisive factor in the strength and weakness of the army and its survival and development. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the political work of our army has been strengthened in inheritance and developed in innovation, giving full play to the lifeline role of political work. The practice of strengthening the army has fully demonstrated that the political work of the army in the new era can only be strengthened and not weakened, can only move forward and not stagnate, and can only be actively acted upon and not passively responded to, and must be grasped in focus and comprehensively strengthened. In the strengthening of party leadership and party building to highlight the role of the lifeline. Party leadership and party building is the key to the construction of our army, the success or failure of the cause of a strong army. In July this year, President Xi made important instructions to the All-Army Party Building Conference, emphasizing the need to continue to promote comprehensive strict governance of the Party and the military, and focus on solving the outstanding problems of Party organizations at all levels in adhering to the absolute leadership of the Party over the military, grasping the ability to prepare for war and implementing the political responsibility of the Party to govern the Party and to provide a strong political guarantee for the realization of the goal of building the Army for one hundred years. Political work must tightly focus on strengthening the Party's leadership and Party building in a comprehensive manner as the fundamental, take forging a firm military soul as the core task, continue to use Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era to focus on the main responsibility and main business of preparing for and fighting battles, gather powerful forces capable of fighting and winning battles, and insist on cultivating the ""four"" revolutionary soldiers of the new era, forging the ""four"" revolutionary soldiers of the new era, and creating the ""four"" revolutionary soldiers of the new era. In focusing on the main duty of preparing for war and gathering powerful forces capable of fighting and winning wars, in insisting on cultivating ""four"" revolutionary soldiers of the new era, and in forging ""four-iron"" tough troops, the lifeline role has been brought into full play to provide a strong political guarantee for the effective fulfillment of missions. In the overall enhancement of the combat effectiveness of the troops to highlight the role of the lifeline. The army is to fight, must put the combat effectiveness standard firmly up. With the accelerated pace of strengthening the army, troops exercises and drills, field training and other combat-oriented military training has become the norm, the use of military force is increasingly normalized and diversified, effective response to changes in science and technology, changes in war, changes in opponents, and vigorously promote the coupling of warfare and training, the system of military training, scientific and technological training, and to comprehensively promote the transformation and upgrading of military training, the need to focus on the center of the political work, the overall situation, and explore the role of the service to ensure the construction of combat power. It is necessary to focus political work on the center, serve the overall situation, explore the mechanism of service guaranteeing the construction of combat power, and integrate political work into all aspects of the construction of combat power and the whole process of preparation for the military struggle. By providing spiritual impetus for the generation of combat power, providing intellectual support for the play of combat power, establishing a correct orientation for the enhancement of combat power, and providing directional guidance for the construction of combat power, the lifeline role of political work has been fully manifested. In the comprehensive strengthening of military governance to highlight the role of the lifeline. Comprehensively strengthening military governance is a complex systematic project involving all aspects of national defense and military construction. In the increasingly complex operation of the military system, how to enhance the wholeness, synergy and high efficiency, need to further strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party over the military; military governance is not limited to the military's own governance, the need for centralized and unified leadership of the Party, the entire army and the people of all ethnic groups of the country to bring together the wisdom and strength of the entire Party; and so on. All of these need to integrate political work into all aspects of military governance, the whole process, through strong political work to set the direction, unify the force, activate the force, and constantly improve the system of socialist military system with Chinese characteristics, so that the military governance and the modernization of the country's system of governance and governance capacity, so that the advantages of China's military system can be better transformed into the effectiveness of military governance. The role of the people's army as a lifeline is manifested in ensuring its political character. The character and style of the people's army derive from the character and style of the Party. By carrying out revolutionary political work, our army has implanted the Party's nature and tenets as well as its character and style in the bloodstream of the majority of officers and soldiers, ensuring that our army is always a new type of people's army of proletarian nature. In the face of the acute and complex struggle in the ideological field, especially the erosive influence of hostile forces advocating such erroneous political views as ""departisanship and apoliticalization of the army"" and ""nationalization of the army,"" and in the face of the increasingly grave national security situation, the arduous and burdensome task of training and preparing for war, and the military struggle, the army is still in the midst of an increasingly difficult situation. In the face of the increasingly serious national security situation, the arduous and heavy task of training and preparing for war and military struggle, the nature of the People's Army must remain unchanged, the tradition of the Old Red Army never be lost, and the political character of hard struggle never be changed. Political work must be oriented to the direction of the Party, educating and guiding officers and soldiers to establish lofty ideals and beliefs, correct values, noble morals, and a strict concept of discipline, to ensure that the people's army remains the same in its original heart and character. The role of political work as a lifeline is a summary of experience, but also a practical subject. Striving for a new journey, the army's political work must grasp the core tasks, focus on the theme of the times, and constantly realize innovative breakthroughs and development. To make the lifeline more vital, the first and foremost thing is to adhere to the Party's absolute leadership of the army. We must carry out a solid study and implementation of Xi Jinping's new era of socialist thought with Chinese characteristics theme education, deepen the transformation of the first batch of theme education results, grasp the second batch of theme education, and coordinate the ""study of strong military ideology, build a strong military cause"" education and practice activities, to help officers and soldiers to further build the ideological and political foundation of the Party's command. To continue to grasp the system of learning and education of the Chairman of the Military Commission, always follow the implementation of the system of the Chairman of the Military Commission as the highest political requirements, as the highest political discipline to strictly abide by, to ensure that the absolute leadership of the Party over the army directly to the grassroots, directly to the officers and soldiers. Efforts should be made to enhance the political and organizational functions of Party organizations at all levels, to seriously enhance the internal political life of the Party, to implement the democratic centralism system, to promote the normalization and institutionalization of political training, to improve the ability of high-level Party committees to take direction, to plan major events, and to grasp the implementation of the Party's activities, so as to effectively forge every grass-roots Party organization into a strong fighting fortress. The epochal theme of the army's political work is to closely focus on realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, to provide strong political guarantee for realizing the Party's goal of strengthening the army in the new era, and to build the People's Army into a world-class army in a comprehensive manner. This theme of the times has profoundly answered the fundamental question of where to move forward, how to strengthen, and how to act in the new era of political work, pointed out the orientation and coordinates of political work in strengthening the army and developing the army, and gave political work a new mission and task. Political work must focus closely on the theme of this era to promote, focus on the ""four fundamental things to stand up"", efforts to build a new era of the people's army ideological and political education system, efforts to flourish and develop a strong military culture, in order to realize the Chinese dream of a strong military dream to provide a reliable political guarantee, a strong spiritual impetus, strong talent support. President Xi made a systematic summary of the fine traditions of our army's political work at the Gutian All-Army Political Work Conference, making it clear that there are ""eleven perspectives"". These fine traditions are the fundamental principles and content of the political work of the army, is the blood and life of the revolutionary forefathers forged the ""real gold"", is a family heirloom that will never fade. Political work to learn traditions, love traditions, speaking of traditions as a regular work, education and guidance officers and soldiers from the combination of history and reality to realize the value of the times of fine traditions, carry forward the fine traditions, do cherish, firmly adhere to, so that the lifeblood of the continuous line, relay transmission. Political work is to do people's work, must be combined with the ideological concepts of officers and soldiers, value orientation, behavior, spiritual and cultural needs and other factors, targeted to do the work, enhance the political work of the times and appeal. Not only to adhere to the fundamental principles and systems of political work, but also to actively promote the political work of thinking concept, mode of operation, guidance, methods and means of innovation, to ensure that the political work of the changing conditions of the times synchronized with the expansion of the mission of the army and the current state of mind of the soldiers and officers in sync. At the same time, scientifically grasp the characteristics and laws of political work in the information network era, make good use of the network platform, promote the high degree of integration of the traditional advantages of political work and information technology, and further enhance the initiative and effectiveness of political work.

The people's army has come a long way, relying on a tight party organization system, rising more and more in setbacks, and moving forward in hardship, forging a steel division that can't be dragged down, can't be beaten, is invincible, and is invincible in battle. On the new journey to create a new situation of party leadership and party building work in the army, it is necessary to further strengthen the construction of the party's organizational system in the army, and continue to strengthen the unique advantages of the army, to provide a strong organizational guarantee for the timely realization of the goal of building the army for 100 years. President Xi emphasized the need to ""build and strengthen the Party organization system of the People's Army"". This important statement reflects the Party's strategic consideration of the construction of the Party's organizational system for the army, and has far-reaching historical significance and great practical significance for forging the Party's organizational system of the People's Army into a stronger and more powerful one. The scientific truth revealed by the Marxist doctrine of party building. The cohesion and application of the power of the Marxist party lies in the scientific organization. Marx and Engels believed that the proletariat should be ""united into a closely united, ready to fight and organized class"". Lenin clearly put forward: ""We should build a centralized, unified, well-organized and disciplined party, and through the unity of the organization we should ensure the strong unity and unanimity of the party."" By organizing dispersed individuals with revolutionary ideals and iron discipline, forming a tightly organized system, and mobilizing and organizing the masses, a multiplication of forces can be achieved. The CPC, in accordance with the Marxist principles of party building and with democratic centralism as the fundamental organizational and leadership system, has established a scientific and tight organizational system consisting of the Party's central, local and grass-roots organizations, forming a powerful organizational mobilization and executive force. For more than a century, our Party has united and led the people to make world-renowned achievements, fully demonstrating the Party's strong organizational strength. The heirloom of going from victory to victory. Attaching great importance to the construction of the Party's organizational system is the winning code of the People's Army. As early as during the First Nationalist-Communist Cooperation, our Party established Party organizations in the armed forces. During the Nanchang Uprising, it was clearly stated that ""the Party's organization is the root of all organizations"" in the insurgent forces, and the Sanwan Reorganization created the precedent of ""building branches on companies"", while the Gutian Conference made it clear that all levels of the Red Army's Party committees should be the ""pivot of leadership"". The Gutian Conference made it clear that the Party committees at all levels of the Red Army should become ""the center of leadership. During the Liberation War and the early years of the founding of New China, the relevant party regulations were adopted to stereotype the party organizations in the army. It can be said that the history of the development and growth of our army is also the history of the continuous improvement and soundness of the party organization system of the army. It is by relying on a strong organizational system that the Party's leadership covers the whole army, reaches the grassroots level, and reaches the officers and soldiers, uniting the people's army into a ""piece of hard steel"" and establishing a great historical merit for the Party and the people. The inevitable requirements for realizing the goal of building the army for 100 years. Realizing the goal of one hundred years of army building is the central task of our army construction in the next few years. The flag leads the direction, and the organization unites the strength. The Party organization of the army is the organizational support for the Party's leadership and mastery of the army, and bears the important responsibility of realizing the Party's absolute leadership of the army, uniting and consolidating the troops, and accomplishing various tasks. The strict party organization system is the unique political advantage of our army, and is also an important guarantee for our army to overcome thousands of difficulties and dangers and defeat the enemy. On the new journey, only by adhering to the organizational line to serve the political line, strengthening the construction of the Party's organizational system, focusing on the Party's political construction, and enhancing the leadership, organizational strength, and executive power of the Party's organizations at all levels can we turn the Party's political and organizational advantages into a winning advantage, and can we take up the responsibility of the times, and hand over the Party and the people's satisfaction with the history of the answer sheet. Second, the strong party organization is the strength of the army's advantages, where the strength. After a long period of practice and exploration, we have formed a set of tight organization system, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission is the brain and the hub, the other levels of the Party Committee is the trunk and limbs, grass-roots party organizations is the party in the nerve endings of the army, the army party members is the cell, the system is the meridian mechanism. In the new starting point to consolidate a strong organizational advantage, we must firmly grasp the connotation of building a strong military party organization system requirements. Implement the Party's organizational line in the new era. The new era calls for new practice, and new practice breeds new theory. President Xi clearly put forward the Party's organizational line of the new era at the 2018 National Conference on Organizational Work, made a complete expression of the Party's organizational line, realized the organic integration of all elements of organizational construction, and enriched and improved the Party's line system from the top-level design, which is of great pioneering significance and contribution. The Party's organizational line in the new era requires ""focusing on the construction of the organizational system"", highlighting the fundamental status of organizations and the requirements for systematic construction. As an armed group that carries out the Party's political mission, the army must have higher standards and stricter requirements in implementing the Party's organizational line in the new era, constantly tightening the organization system that is coherent and powerful, highlighting the enhancement of political and organizational functions, and forging a strong and powerful Party organization. Implement the ""four insistences"" requirement. Emphasis on the grassroots, relying on the grassroots, building strong grass-roots, is our party to build the army to rule the army's consistent thinking. At the beginning of the army, the party focused on winning the war to create a grass-roots party organization hub, closely rely on the main body of the officers and soldiers, adhere to the law from the strict tamping the foundation of the troops, formed a series of grasp the construction of the grass-roots level of valuable experience. Into the new era, President Xi emphasized in accordance with the requirements of the ""four insist on twisting"" to grasp the grass-roots level, clear the basic path to consolidate the foundation of the army, is a new era to grasp the grass-roots construction of the basic fundamental guidelines and guidelines for action. At present, the grass-roots construction of our army is in the period of accelerated transformation and development, the period of training and preparation for war, and the period of releasing the effectiveness of the reform, we must focus on the new situation and new problems of the ""six new changes"" and ""six can not keep up with"", adhere to the outline of the construction, and strive to build a strong first-line command, first-line battle The first line of command, the first line of the fortress, the first line of the military team, comprehensive forging ""three hard"" grass-roots level. Adhere to the Party's management of cadres and talents. The way to strengthen the army is to get people. Into the new era, from the first proposed implementation of the strategy of strengthening the army with talents, to the 19th Party Congress proposed to comprehensively promote the modernization of military personnel, and then to the 20th Party Congress deployed to ""deepen the reform of the military academy, to build a strong new military personnel training system, and to innovate in the management of military manpower resources"", to Xi Jinping as the core of the CPC Central Committee insisted on strengthening the army with talents to be included in the strategy of strengthening the army in the new era, and the development of the army. The CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has insisted on integrating talents into the strategic layout of strengthening the army in the new era, and has clearly put forward the standard of good cadres in the army, cultivating, examining, and utilizing talents politically to ensure that the barrel of the gun is always in the hands of those who are loyal to the Party and reliable. Cadre construction is related to the overall situation of the army construction, the relationship between future war victory or defeat; to win the high-tech war, the most scarce, the most urgent need is high-quality talents. Build a strong military party organization system, the key to forging a loyal, clean and responsible high-quality cadres, gathering all aspects of the military to win the best talent, we must adhere to the party-managed cadres, the party-managed talent, the implementation of the military standard of good cadres, the whole chain of tighten the construction of the cadres. Set up a real grasp of the style of work-oriented. Real grasp in order to overcome difficulties, practical work in order to dream come true. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the national defense and military construction has made historic achievements and changes, which can not be separated from the word ""practical work"". It is by doing, the party's political advantages and organizational advantages fully manifested, the party's absolute leadership of the army comprehensive and strong, the new era of the party's innovative theoretical armament shows great power, focusing on winning to ensure the role of the full release, the party's organizational system is strong and powerful, the accelerated formation of a new military talent array, comprehensively strict governance of the party, comprehensively strict governance of the army is highly effective. ""The road is simple, and practical work is essential."" The new journey is an expedition full of glory and dreams, we must bear in mind the simple truth that empty talk is misleading the country and practical work will prosper the country, give full play to the leadership role of the Party Committee, the role of the grass-roots Party organizations as a battleground and the role of vanguard party members as exemplary models, and consolidate the army into an unbreakable, indestructible fighting collective, so that the Party's leadership ""is like a body making an arm and an arm making a finger! The Party's leadership is ""like a body making an arm, like an arm making a finger"". The Party's comprehensive leadership and all of its work depend on the Party's strong organizational system. The Central Military Commission issued the ""on the realization of the army around the hundred years of the goal of comprehensively strengthening the army party building opinions"", to build a strong army party organization system to make a comprehensive deployment, we must deeply understand, resolute implementation. Efforts to strengthen the role of organizational functions. The more fully the organizational function is played, the more dynamic the cause of strengthening the army is. To strengthen the Party's awareness, organizational concepts, with the Party's innovative theories, seriously study the Party's laws and regulations, consciously identify with the organization ideologically, politically rely on the organization, work to obey the organization, emotionally trust the organization. To strict system of organizational life of the party, the courage to carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that each party organization has become a fighting fortress to stir up turbulence, so that each member of the party has become a combatant to help correct and eliminate evil. To strengthen the standardization of party organizations, in-depth investigation and research, to explore the institutionalization of the grasp, standardization of construction, fine management of the party building road. Adhere to the large grasp of the grassroots to consolidate the foundation. Grassroots is the foundation of all the work and combat effectiveness of the troops. To always highlight the party organization to help grasp the grassroots, regular help to build the party branch, help with the secretary, help to grasp the work of the backbone, and constantly innovate the ""three major organizations"" joint construction and joint creation measures. To make great efforts to rectify the tendency of grass-roots problems, carry out solid grass-roots governance, vigorously rectify corruption and unethical practices around the officers and soldiers, to the officers and soldiers around the incipient, tendency problems, early reminder and early correction, to prevent minor problems from becoming major problems.

From a global and strategic perspective, President Xi fully affirmed the historic achievements of the propaganda, ideology and culture cause since the 18th CPC National Congress, profoundly elaborated on the important status and role of propaganda, ideology and culture work, and put forward clear requirements for the comprehensive implementation of the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, assuming the new cultural mission, and doing a good job of propaganda, ideology and culture work in the new era and new journey. The most important result of the National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology and Culture is the formal introduction and systematic elaboration of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, which is a milestone in the history of the development of the Party's propaganda, ideology and culture. Combined with the in-depth study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we should continue to strengthen the study, research and interpretation of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture and consciously implement it into all aspects and the whole process of cultural construction in the new era, so as to make new contributions to the promotion of the construction of a strong socialist cultural country. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought was formed through the scientific application of Marxist cultural theory, in-depth analysis of world and national conditions, and effective solutions to the major theoretical and practical problems facing cultural construction in the new era; it is a major theoretical innovation that responds to the requirements of the era of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and has demonstrated a powerful force of truth and practical strength in promoting the historic achievements of the cause of propaganda, ideology and culture in the new era. The Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction in the new era has been a source of inspiration for the Party. It is a theoretical summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction in the new era. Practice is the fertile ground for theory, and theory is the rational sublimation of practical experience. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has always placed cultural construction in an important position in the management of the country, based on the great practice of cultural construction in the new era, focusing on the intrinsic requirements of building a strong socialist cultural country, presided over a series of important meetings, delivered a series of important speeches, made a series of important instructions, put forward a series of new concepts, new ideas and new strategies, and scientifically answered the question of ""what path to take and what direction to move towards"" in the construction of culture in the new era. ""What path to take, toward what goal"" this major issue, to promote the new era of propaganda, ideology and cultural undertakings have made historic achievements, the ideological situation in the field of global and fundamental changes, the whole party, the whole army, the whole country, people of all ethnic groups, cultural self-confidence has been significantly strengthened, and the spirit of the more energetic and high-spirited. It is in this great journey that the Party has continuously deepened its understanding of the regularity of socialist cultural construction and accumulated valuable historical experience, which has a significant leading and guiding role in leading the Party's cultural construction in the new era. The latest achievement of the Chineseization and modernization of Marxist cultural theory. Marxist cultural theory has been developed and enriched in a vast and profound social revolution. As early as during the New Democratic Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that we wanted to build a new society and a new country for the Chinese nation, with ""not only new politics and a new economy, but also a new culture."" In the course of revolution, construction and reform, the Party led the people to create a revolutionary culture and an advanced socialist culture, and formed new achievements on Marxist cultural theory. Since the 18th National Congress of the Party, President Xi has accurately grasped the trend of mutual ideological and cultural agitation worldwide and profound changes in the ideology and concepts of our society, scientifically grasped the inherent laws of the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and put forward a series of original new ideas and new opinions and assertions based on the inheritance of the fine traditions and closely adapted to the new conditions of the times and the requirements of practice, which have enriched and developed the cultural theory of Marxism, and formed Xi Jinping's cultural theory. This has enriched and developed Marxist cultural theory and formed Xi Jinping's cultural thought, which constitutes the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics for a new era. It is a powerful ideological weapon for forging new splendor of Chinese culture in the new era and new journey. Xi Jinping's cultural thought is rich in connotation, has a grand vision, penetrates the past and present, and is profound in its exposition, clearly defining the roadmap and mission statement for the construction of culture in the new era, and providing a powerful ideological weapon and scientific action guide for doing a good job of propaganda, ideology and culture work in the new era and new journey, and taking up the new cultural mission. We should closely focus on the new cultural mission, focus on the implementation of the Party's 20th National Congress on the strategic deployment of cultural construction, continue to strengthen the study, research, interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, with a strong spirit of historical initiative, efforts to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings and cultural industries, and constantly enhance the cultural self-consciousness, firm cultural self-confidence, to create a new glory of Chinese culture, in order to promote the construction of a strong country and realize the rejuvenation of the nation, provide a strong value guidance, cultural cohesion and cultural cohesion. We will provide powerful value guidance, cultural cohesion and spiritual impetus for the construction of a strong nation and the realization of national rejuvenation.

We should closely follow the pace of the Party's theoretical innovation, focus on the study of major theoretical and practical issues, and continue to strengthen the study, research, and interpretation of Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, so as to make the theoretical research more profound and systematic, the theoretical propaganda more penetrating to the people's hearts, and the theoretical armament more solid and effective, and to continuously push forward the propaganda and ideological work to open up new horizons and make new progress. Continuously strengthen the study, research and interpretation of the rich connotation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought. The decade or so of the new era is an important period in which the Party and the country's cause have made historic achievements and undergone historic changes, and it is also an important period in which the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics has achieved fruitful theoretical and practical results. It is necessary to closely link the extraordinary practice of the Party and the country's cultural construction endeavors that have made historic achievements and undergone historic changes since the 18th CPC National Congress, the extremely unusual and extraordinary vivid course we have traveled over these years, the unremitting struggle to deepen reform and opening up, promote high-quality development, and effectively respond to major risks and challenges in this new era, as well as the profound changes that have occurred in the mutual agitation of ideas and cultures worldwide, and to thoroughly study the Xi Jinping's cultural thought is characterized by the characteristics of the times, core essence, spiritual essence and rich connotation, and constantly deepens the regular understanding of cultural construction in the new era, so as to lay a solid ideological foundation for good propaganda and ideological and cultural work.

Xi Jinping's cultural thought is a scientific theory formed in the practice of the great struggle of the new era, and an important magic weapon to deal with the risks and challenges in the field of propaganda, ideology and culture under the new situation. We should deepen our understanding and grasp of the scientific worldview and methodology of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, deepen our scientific research and judgment of the situation of the struggle for cultural construction in the new era, especially strengthen our research and analysis of the various erroneous trends affecting the guiding position of Marxism in the field of ideology, and the means and tricks used by the West to confuse right and wrong, turn black and white upside down, and mislead public opinion, so as to prepare for the rainy days, prepare for the risks in times of peace, and constantly put forward scientific and effective ideas for response and preventive measures, so as to prevent the risks in the field of propaganda and ideology. We have been constantly putting forward scientific and effective ideas and preventive measures to provide strong theoretical guidance for the consolidation of the main positions in the field of ideology. Continuing to promote cultural prosperity, build a strong cultural country, and build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation from a new historical starting point is our new cultural mission in the new era and new journey. To take up this new cultural mission, we must continue to strengthen the study, research and interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, better grasp the essence of the theory, follow the inner laws, identify the key points, and innovate methods and means, so as to enhance the effectiveness of propaganda, ideology and culture, and to unite the hundreds of millions of people's unity and spiritual strength.

军事论坛丨将德修炼是研兵学谋的根基 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李炳彦 责任编辑：季鹏洋 2023-10-24 06:25:47 0,将德修炼是研兵学谋的根基 ■李炳彦 核心提示 ●《孙子兵法》作为“兵权谋”的代表作，是一座智慧殿堂和谋略宝库。当我们走进这座殿堂，寻求制胜方略时，应当把将德修炼作为研兵学谋的根基。 ●《孙子兵法》在“计篇”中指出：“将者，智、信、仁、勇、严也”。这五个字，是为将者的五条标准，也被称为将之五德。 （一） 智是谋之源，谋是智之用。我们常说，足智多谋。孙子说的智，不同于今天说的智商。智商很高的人，若没有成熟的修炼，常常变成一种小聪明。作为军事将领的智，应当有以下突出表现： 首先是预见力。历史上那些能征善战的军事家，都具有超人的预见力。预见力又分战略预见和战术预见。战略预见是关于全局性、长远性的预见，“预见存亡祸福之原，早知盛衰废兴之始，防事之未萌，避难于无形”。战术预见则主要是对具体事件发展前景的预见，“见事而知得失成败之分，而究其所终极，故无败业废功”。军事作战中，指敌情判断，知彼知己，料敌设谋。 毛泽东同志在党的七大报告中说：“坐在指挥台上，如果什么也看不见，就不能叫领导。坐在指挥台上，只看见地平线上已经出现的大量的普遍的东西，那是平平常常的，也不能算领导。只有当着还没有出现大量的明显的东西的时候，当桅杆顶刚刚露出的时候，就能看出这是要发展成为大量的普遍的东西，并能掌握住它，这才叫领导。”领导就是引导，引导必须有先见之明。毛泽东同志在领导中国革命和建设中，每一项重大决策，都是以超越常人的预见力，在最困难时看到希望，在黑暗中看到曙光，在迷茫中看清道路，在胜利中看到新的挑战。 其次是决断力。决断力和预见力相关联，分为战略决断与战术决断。战略上的决断，重在审时度势，对时代、历史、社会发展的大趋势有正确的认识，关键时刻能制定正确的战略策略。战术性的决断，是正确地选定战役战术行动计划。毛泽东同志说过，指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。 第三是创新力。与预见力、决断力相关联，智的又一个重要内涵是创造力，或者说创新力。善于创新的人，首先是观念的不断创新。新的观念产生新的想法、新的思路。而陈旧的观念则是禁锢人们创造力的枷锁、阻碍新思想的最大障碍。 提高创新能力固然需要知识，但知识不等于能力。只有在艰苦奋斗的实践中，才能把知识转化为创新力。军事指挥员尤其要重视在实践中磨炼。历史上不乏赵括之类的人物，饱读兵书，却打败仗；也有如汉代霍去病这类的天才将领，没读过兵书，用兵打仗“每每和孙吴暗合”。当然，这不是否定读书的重要，而是反复论证一条真理：“纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行”“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”。使用的过程，也就是修炼提升的过程。 第四是运用资源的能力。对军事指挥员来说，是力量运用的能力。力量与力量的运用不同，所以战争史上出现了许多以弱胜强、以少胜多的战例。运用资源的能力，“形而上”的叫艺术，“形而下”的叫方法；高超的艺术是伟大天才的思维闪光，科学的方法要靠学习去把握；艺术是通过实践去领悟，“运用之妙，存乎一心”，方法是在运用中不断提升。艺术与方法常常是融合的，表现为战略战术的筹划、战略策略的设计、战略路线图的描绘、战术计谋的构想，等等。 第五是识人用人的能力。识人用人看似简单，实则不易，可以说是指挥员经常困惑的一件事。诸葛亮足智多谋，结合自己的实践，写出《将苑》一书，主要论述将性、将道、知人善任等。但他还是错用了马谡，造成街亭之败。其实，马谡也是个人才。诸葛亮南征时，他提出“攻心为上，攻城为下；心战为上，兵战为下”的见解，还是很有见地的。只不过，马谡缺少实践历练，作高参可以，担任一线主将，其指挥实际作战能力弱的缺点就被彻底放大，最终导致蜀军全线被动。总括起来讲，诸葛亮对马谡是用错了岗位。 知人者智，自知者明。清末湘军将领曾国藩在功成名就时，要求他的将军们读乾隆时期重臣孙嘉淦的一篇议奏——《三习一弊疏》。旨在提醒手下将领越是在战场上打得顺风顺水的时候，越要戒骄戒躁，越要善于听取不同意见。否则，就很容易丧失识人用人、量才录用的能力。 （二） 为将的信誉、诚心，可直接转化为军队的战斗力。“信盖天下，然后能约天下”。将军带兵，守信用才能得到部下的信任，而信任就是带领团队走向光明的火炬。战国时期，商鞅主导秦国改革，首先“徙木立信”，顺利拓开改革之路，是个范例。 孙子讲的将德，是战略“五要素”（即道、天、地、将、法）之一，将德中的“信”，自然与“道”相联系，包含了信念这个信誉的灵魂。 习主席高度重视传承发展中华优秀传统军事文化，多次强调“为将之道，当先治心”。崇高的理想、坚定的信念，是革命军人的灵魂，是克敌制胜、拒腐防变的决定性因素。从人民军队成长历程看，我军的将帅始终有着坚定正确的政治方向，有着不变的理想和信念，带领的是人民军队，打的是人民战争，所以能创造出灵活机动的战略战术。 有信念就必然有自信，有自信方有意志力。面对重重战争阻力，为将者有自信，部队就能看到希望之光，就有必胜的勇气，就能形成“激流漂石”之势。俗话说，胜兵如秋风，兵败如山倒。前者是充满自信心军队的表现，后者是完全失去自信心军队的状态。 （三） 仁，本来是儒家思想的核心。中国古代兵家价值观为儒道合一，把仁作为将德修炼，主要强调爱兵亲民。《孙子兵法》讲：“视卒如婴儿，故可与之赴深溪；视卒如爱子，故可与之俱死。” 作为指挥员的仁，还表现为礼贤下士、尊重人才。有个典故叫“周公吐哺”，说的是周武王死后，年幼的成王继位，周公肩负起辅佐成王的责任。周公非常礼遇有才能的人。有时他正在吃饭，门人报告有贤士来访，周公立即将口中的食物吐出，迅速出来接见来宾。如此一来，有才能的人都聚集到他的身边，服务于周王朝。所以，“周公吐哺，天下归心”，成了对“仁”的最好注释。 （四） 一般情况下讲勇，多指两军阵前，奋不顾身、奋勇杀敌的英雄豪气。为将者，平时不贪财，战时不惜命，军必兴。 将德修炼中的勇，更重要的还在决定军队、国家命运的重要关头，表现出的沉着稳定、无私无畏、从容应对的胆略和风度。“泰山崩于前而色不变，麋鹿兴于左而目不瞬，然后可以制利害，可以待敌”。 “但用东山谢安石，为君谈笑静胡沙。”诗词是唐代李白对一位军事将领的赞誉。这位将领就是在淝水之战中指挥东晋军队、打败前秦百万大军的谢安。他在大敌当前、国家处于危急的时刻，镇定自若，从容应对，慎独静思，运筹破敌良策，终于以少胜多，扶大厦之将倾。 （五） 这里讲的严，是严军纪。军纪严明，才有执行力、战斗力。严的前提是明，军纪不能光讲抽象的道理，而要有简洁明了的可执行条文。我军的“三大纪律，八项注意”就是典范。华为对员工提出“以制度管人，以流程管事”，其中要求做到“五个必须”：对要做的每个项目，首先必须有明确的目标，有目标必须有计划，有计划必须有方案，有方案必须有检查，有检查必须有结果。这样，不流于一般口号，每件事都能落到实处。 在各种制度、纪律中，与人关系最密切、最经常、最直接影响战斗力的是赏罚制度。对此，古代军事家提出了四条原则：赏不逾时，罚不迁列，赏不避小，罚不避大。军事史上有很多严明军纪的故事，如孙武吴宫演阵斩王姬，田穰苴辕门立表斩庄贾，周亚夫细柳行军令等，都传为千古佳话。 （六） 孙子讲的为将者五德，是一个整体，是相辅相成的综合思想品格。智者不迷，信可领众，仁能聚力，勇者果敢，严必立威。有兵家评说：“非智不可以料敌应机，非信不可以训人率下，非仁不可以附众抚士，非勇不可以决谋合战，非严不可以服强齐众。全此五才，将之体也。”又有一评说：“专任智则贼，偏施仁则懦，固守信则愚，恃勇力则暴，令过严则残。五者兼备，各适其用，则可为将帅。”总之，将德修炼，在于五德合成，全面发展。 《孙子兵法》产生的时代，是中国古代复杂系统哲学形成的时代。孙子运用太极阴阳哲学观，研究战争、研究将帅品格修炼，非常强调“度”的把握。于是，一方面强调将之五德，一方面又讲到将之“五危”。“故将有五危：必死，可杀也；必生，可虏也；忿速，可侮也；廉洁，可辱也；爱民，可烦也。凡此五者，将之过也，用兵之灾也。覆军杀将，必以五危，不可不察也。”其实，将之五危，正是将德修炼错位的表现。比如，足智多谋是将德之首，但智用太过就可能狐疑不决。《六韬》中说，“用兵之害，犹豫最大；三军之灾，莫过狐疑。” “天之道，利而不害；圣人之道，为而不争”，这是《道德经》最后的结语。孙子论述将德修炼，在吸收道家的价值取向中，蕴含着以出世之心态，做入世之功业，大智不彰，大功不扬。“故进不求名，退不避罪，唯人是保”，使将德修炼升华为“内圣外王”的境界。 新征程上新使命新担当，要求我们必须大力弘扬中国古代优秀军事文化中的优秀因子，赋予将德修炼以时代新内涵，不断为打赢未来战争造就可堪大用之才。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231025000351/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16261215.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231024003755/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16261215.html,2023-10-25 0:00:00,军事论坛丨将德修炼是研兵学谋的根基 Source：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李炳彦 责任编辑：季鹏洋 2023-10-24 06:25:47 0,"The cultivation of virtues is the foundation of the study of military strategy ■ Li Bingyan Core Tips ● ""Sun Tzu's Art of War"" as a ""military power strategy"" masterpiece, is a temple of wisdom and a treasure trove of strategies. When we enter this hall, seeking to win the strategy, we should take the cultivation of virtue as the foundation of the study of military strategy. Sun Tzu's The Art of War points out in the chapter of ""Strategies"": ""A general is wise, trustworthy, benevolent, courageous and strict"". These five words are the five standards of a general, also known as the five virtues of a general. (a) Wisdom is the source of strategy, and strategy is the use of wisdom. We often say that one is wise and resourceful. The wisdom that Sun Tzu speaks of is different from the IQ that is spoken of today. People with a high IQ often become a kind of small-mindedness if they do not have mature cultivation. As a military general's wisdom, there should be the following outstanding performance: First of all, foresight. History of those able to fight the military, all have superhuman foresight. Foresight is divided into strategic foresight and tactical foresight. Strategic foresight is about the overall situation, long-term foresight, ""foresee the survival of the original disaster, early to know the beginning of the decline of the abolition of the rise and fall, to prevent things before they emerge, take refuge in the invisible"". Tactical foresight is mainly on the development of specific events in the foreseeable future, ""to see things and know the success or failure of the points, and the ultimate study of its, so there is no failure to abolish the work"". In military combat, it refers to judging the enemy, knowing the enemy and knowing oneself, and anticipating the enemy's plans. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the report of the Seventh Party Congress: ""Sitting on the command platform, if you can't see anything, you can't call it leadership. Sitting on a commanding platform and seeing only a large number of universal things that have already appeared on the horizon, that is plain and ordinary, and cannot be called leadership. It is only to be able to see when the mass of something obvious has not yet appeared, when the top of the mast is just showing, that this is to develop into a mass of something universal, and to be able to grasp it, that is called leadership."" To lead is to guide, and to guide one must be prescient. In leading the Chinese revolution and construction, Comrade Mao Zedong made every major decision with a foresight that surpassed the ordinary, seeing hope in the most difficult times, light in the darkness, clear paths in the confusion, and new challenges in the midst of victory. Second is the power of determination. Determination and foresight are related, divided into strategic determination and tactical determination. Strategic decision, focusing on the time and situation, the times, history, social development of the general trend of a correct understanding of the key moment to develop a correct strategic strategy. Tactical decision is the correct selection of the tactical plan of action for the battle. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the correct deployment of a commander comes from correct determination, correct determination comes from correct judgment, and correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance and coherent thinking about various reconnaissance materials. The third is the power of innovation. Associated with foresight and determination, another important connotation of wisdom is creativity, or innovation. People who are good at innovation, first of all, the concept of continuous innovation. New concepts generate new ideas, new thoughts. The stereotypes are the shackles that confine people's creativity and the biggest obstacle to new ideas. Improving innovation certainly requires knowledge, but knowledge is not equal to ability. Only in the practice of hard work can knowledge be transformed into innovative power. Military commanders should pay particular attention to the practice of honing. There is no lack of history, such as Zhao Kuo characters, read the book of war, but defeat; also such as the Han Dynasty Huo Zaodong such genius generals, did not read the book of war, fighting with the military ""every time and Sun Wu dark"". Of course, this is not to deny the importance of reading, but to repeatedly argue a truth: ""the paper to get the ultimate shallow, absolutely know the matter to be practiced"" ""reading is learning, use is also learning, and is more important learning"". The process of use is also the process of cultivation and improvement. The fourth is the ability to use resources. For military commanders, it is the ability to use power. The use of force is different from the use of power, so the history of war has seen many examples of weakness over strength and few over many. The ability to use resources, ""metaphysical"" is called art, ""metaphysical"" is called the method; high art is the great genius of thinking flash, scientific method to rely on learning to grasp; the art is through the practice of comprehension, ""the use of the wonderful, exists in one heart. The art is realized through practice, and ""the beauty of application depends on one's own mind"", and the method is constantly upgraded in the application. Art and method are often fusion, manifested as strategic tactical planning, strategic strategy design, strategic roadmap depiction, tactical plan conception, and so on. The fifth is the ability to recognize and employ people. Knowledge of people with people seems simple, but is not easy, can be said to be the commander is often confused about a thing. Zhuge Liang is very resourceful, combined with his own practice, wrote the book ""will garden"", mainly discusses the will nature, will road, know people well, and so on. However, he still misused Ma Su, resulting in the defeat of Jie Ting. In fact, Ma Su was also a talent. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition, he put forward the opinion that ""attacking the heart is the top, attacking the city is the bottom; heart war is the top, military war is the bottom"", which is still very insightful. Only, Ma Su lack of practical experience, as a senior staff can, as a line general, its command of the actual combat ability of the weak shortcomings are completely amplified, eventually leading to the whole Shu army passive. To summarize, Zhuge Liang used the wrong position for Ma Su. Those who know others are wise, and those who know themselves are wise. When Zeng Guofan, a general of the Hunan army at the end of the Qing Dynasty, had achieved great success, he asked his generals to read a motion by Sun Jiajian, an important minister during the Qianlong period - ""Three Exercises and One Disadvantage"". The purpose was to remind his generals that the more they fought well on the battlefield, the more they had to refrain from arrogance and the more they had to be good at listening to different opinions. Otherwise, it will be easy to lose the ability to recognize and employ people and to measure talents. (ii) The credibility and sincerity of a general can be directly translated into the fighting power of the army. ""The world is covered by faith, and then the world can be contracted."" When a general leads an army, he has to keep his word in order to gain the trust of his subordinates, and trust is the torch that leads the team to the light. During the Warring States period, Shang Yang led the reform of the Qin State, and first of all, he ""moved the wood to establish trust"", which successfully opened up the road of reform, and this is an example. Sun Tzu's general virtue is one of the five elements of strategy (i.e., Taoism, heaven, earth, generals, and law), and the ""faith"" in general virtue is naturally linked to Taoism, which contains the credibility of faith. Soul. President Xi attaches great importance to the inheritance and development of the excellent traditional Chinese military culture, and has repeatedly emphasized that ""the way of a general is to rule the heart first"". High ideals and firm beliefs are the soul of a revolutionary soldier, and are the decisive factor in overcoming the enemy and resisting corruption and change. From the growth of the people's army, the generals of our army always have a firm and correct political direction, with unchanging ideals and beliefs, leading the people's army, fighting the people's war, so we can create a flexible and maneuverable strategy and tactics. Have faith is bound to have confidence, have confidence party have willpower. In the face of heavy resistance to war, the generals have confidence, the troops will be able to see the light of hope, there will be the courage to win, will be able to form a ""torrent drifting stone"" of the situation. As the saying goes, the victory of the army, such as the autumn wind, the defeat of the army. The former is the performance of an army full of self-confidence, and the latter is the state of an army that has completely lost its self-confidence. (c) Benevolence was originally the core of Confucianism. Ancient Chinese military values for Confucianism and Taoism, the benevolence as a general virtues practice, mainly emphasizing the love of soldiers and pro-people. Sun Tzu's Art of War says: ""See the pawns as babies, so you can go to the deep stream with them; see the pawns as love children, so you can die with them."" As a commander's benevolence, also manifested as courtesy and respect for talent. There is an old story called ""The Duke of Zhou Spits Out His Feeding"", which says that after the death of King Wu of Zhou, the young King Cheng succeeded to the throne, and the Duke of Zhou shouldered the responsibility of assisting King Cheng. The Duke of Zhou was very courteous to talented people. Sometimes when he was having a meal and the doorkeeper reported a visit from a wise man, the Duke of Zhou would spit out the food in his mouth and quickly come out to meet the guest. In this way, talented people gathered around him to serve the Zhou Dynasty. Therefore, the saying, ""When the Duke of Zhou spits out his food, the whole world returns to him"" is the best commentary on ""benevolence"". (d) Generally speaking, bravery refers to the heroic spirit of fighting and killing the enemy in front of two armies. As a general, if he is not greedy for money in normal times and does not hesitate to kill in times of war, the army will prosper. The courage in the cultivation of general virtues, more importantly, also in the important juncture of deciding the fate of the army and the country, showing calm and stable, selfless and fearless, and calmly respond to the boldness and demeanor. ""Tarzan collapsed in front of the color unchanged, the moose rose in the left and the eye does not flicker, then you can control the interests and interests of the enemy can be treated."" ""But with the east mountain Xie Anshi, for the king to talk and laugh quiet husha."" The poem is the praise of Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty for a military general. This general was Xie An, who commanded the Eastern Jin army in the Battle of the Interstate War and defeated the million-strong army of the Former Qin Dynasty. He was in the face of the enemy, the country is in a critical moment, calm and collected, calm response, careful meditation, planning to break the enemy's good strategy, and finally fewer than many, help the building will fall. (E) The strict, is strict military discipline. Military discipline is strict and clear, there is the executive force, combat effectiveness. Strict premise is clear, military discipline can not just talk about abstract reasoning, but to have a clear and concise implementation of the provisions. Our army's ""three major disciplines, eight points of attention"" is a model. Huawei put forward to the staff ""to system management, to process management"", which requires to do ""five must"": to do each project, first of all, there must be a clear goal, there must be a plan, there must be a plan, there must be a plan, there must be a program, there must be a program to check, there must be a check, there must be results. Inspection must have results. In this way, it does not flow into general slogans, and everything can be put into practice. Among the various systems and disciplines, the one that has the closest relationship with people, the most frequent and the most direct impact on combat effectiveness is the system of reward and punishment. In this regard, ancient militarists put forward four principles: reward does not exceed the time, punishment does not move columns, reward does not avoid small, punishment does not avoid big. There are many stories of strict military discipline in military history, such as Sun Wu Wu Palace performance array beheading Wang Ji, Tian Rang Tho Yuanyuan door standing table beheading Zhuang Jia, Zhou Yafu fine willow marching orders, etc., have been passed down for ages. (F) Sun Tzu spoke of the five virtues of the general, is a whole, is complementary to a comprehensive ideological character. Wisdom is not confused, the letter can lead the crowd, benevolence can gather force, courageous and bold, strict will be established. A military comment: ""non-wisdom can not anticipate the enemy to respond to the opportunity, non-confidence can not be trained to rate the next, non-ren can not be attached to the crowd to caress the soldiers, non-courage can not be decided to plan the war, non-serious can not be served by the strong QiZhiZhong. All these five talents, the body of the general."" There is another comment: ""specializing in wisdom is a thief, favoring the application of benevolence is cowardly, solid faith is stupid, rely on the courage and strength is violent, the order is too strict is disabled. The five are ready, each suitable for its use, can be a general."" In short, the cultivation of generalship lies in the synthesis of the five virtues and their comprehensive development. Sun Tzu's The Art of War came into being at a time when the philosophy of complex systems was being formed in ancient China. Sun Tzu used Tai Chi Yin Yang philosophical outlook to study war and the cultivation of the general's character, and emphasized very much on the grasp of ""degree"". Thus, on the one hand, he emphasized the five virtues of a general, and on the other hand, he talked about the ""five dangers"" of a general. ""Therefore, there will be five dangers: must die, can be killed; must be born, can be captured; wrath quickly, can be insulted; clean, can be humiliated; love the people, can be annoying. All of these five, will be too much, the disaster of the military also. Overwhelm the army to kill the general, will be five danger, can not be ignored."" In fact, the five dangers of the general, it is will be virtue cultivation misplaced performance. For example, resourcefulness is the first of the general's virtues, but too much wisdom may be indecisive. Six Towers"" said, ""the harm of using the army, the greatest hesitation; the disaster of the three armies, no more than doubt."" ""The way of heaven is to benefit but not to harm; the way of the sage is to act but not to contend,"" is the final conclusion of the Tao Te Ching. Sun Tzu discusses the cultivation of general virtues, and in absorbing the Taoist values, he implies that with the mindset of the worldly, one should do the work of the worldly, and that great wisdom should not be manifested, and great work should not be promoted. ""Therefore, I do not seek fame, I do not avoid sin, and I only protect people"", which sublimates the cultivation of virtue into the realm of ""inner saint and outer king"". The new mission and new responsibilities on the new journey require us to vigorously carry forward the excellent factors of ancient Chinese military culture, give the cultivation of virtue a new connotation of the times, and continuously create talents that can be used to win future wars.","This article discusses the importance of cultivating virtues in military strategy, as outlined in Sun Tzu's ""Art of War."" It emphasizes the interdependence of virtues such as wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and warns against the dangers of overindulgence in any one virtue, as it may lead to failures in the battlefield.

In the new era and new journey, it is urgent to strengthen the cross-military governance to innovate the concept of thinking, cohesion of the military consensus, focus on key tasks, continue to optimize the institutional mechanism, improve the organizational system, improve the policy system, the formation of the respective responsibilities, close collaboration, standardized and orderly cross-military work pattern, in order to promote the simultaneous enhancement of national defense strength and economic strength, to consolidate and improve the integration of the national strategic system and capacity to provide strong support. Recognize the significance of strengthening cross-military governance Cross-military governance is a bridge linking national governance and military governance, an important means of integrating economic construction and national defense construction, and is characterized by a complex system, pluralistic subjects, trans-domain objects, and cross-functions, etc. It is an important aspect of the current military governance that needs to be strengthened and a weak link, and it is a strong support for consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capability. Comprehensively strengthening the proper meaning of military governance. Correctly handling the major relationship between the military and the ground and strengthening cross-military governance is of great significance and unique value in promoting organic convergence and close synergy between military governance and national governance, and in promoting the high-quality development of military governance. On the one hand, taking cross-military governance as a combination of national governance and military governance, and insisting on systematic planning, linkage between the military and the land, and advancing as a whole, is conducive to enhancing the relevance and coupling of national governance and military governance-related initiatives. On the other hand, strengthening cross-military governance is an inherent requirement for enhancing the integrity of military governance. In cross-military fields such as national defense science and technology industry, national defense mobilization, etc., the full introduction of advanced governance concepts and governance methods such as openness, cooperation and sharing can provide inexhaustible impetus to stimulate the vitality of military governance, improve governance capacity and enhance governance efficiency. Consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capabilities is an inherent requirement. President Xi has emphasized that the key to consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capability is to work on integration. Therefore, there is an urgent need to take integration as a strategic guide and fundamental guideline for strengthening cross-military governance, promote cross-military cross-sector and cross-field collaborative governance, and accelerate the formation of thinking concepts, organizational systems, operational mechanisms, and institutional rules compatible with integration; there is an urgent need to improve and perfect the unified leadership, military coordination, smooth and efficient organization and management system in response to the problems of the multiple subjects of governance in the cross-military field and the cross-functionality between the military and the military; there is an urgent need to address the complexity of business processes. There is an urgent need to improve the state-led, demand-driven, market-applied operation system in response to the reality of complex business processes and other contradictions; and there is an urgent need to improve the systematic, comprehensive, articulated and effective incentive policy system in response to the lagging behind of the rule of law construction in important areas and the lack of compatibility of standards and norms. Clarify the main tasks of strengthening cross-military governance Strengthening cross-military governance, with the goal of consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capabilities, and with the promotion of civil-military integration as the main task, fully utilize strategic thinking, innovative thinking, dialectical thinking, rule of law thinking, bottom-line thinking, and focus on mending the shortcomings, strengthening the weaknesses, and accelerating the enhancement of governance capabilities. Strengthen strategic thinking, smooth cross-military strategic management links. To strengthen the country and the military, strategy comes first. To strengthen cross-military governance, it is necessary to take the goal of integrating the strategic layout, integrating the strategic resources, and applying the strategic forces as a whole, follow the basic principle of demand-driven planning and planning-led resource allocation, insist on guiding the direction and amount of national strategic resources with the national interests and strategic goals, insist on synchronizing the efforts on the demand side and the supply side, and open up the chain of cross-military strategic management, integrate and optimize the national strategic system, and Promote the maximization of national strategic capabilities. Strengthen innovative thinking, and build a pattern of joint construction, co-management and governance between the military and the people. Innovation is the first driving force for development. We should further break the traditional mindset, adapt to the new characteristics and requirements of open system, resource sharing and force sharing, resolutely remove barriers and thresholds, firmly establish new concepts of coordination, openness and collaboration, one-piece integration, joint construction and sharing, and co-creation and joint governance, and further optimize the cross-military governance system and mechanism. It has enriched governance methods such as joint military construction, market operation and big data support, optimized the functional configuration of the military, improved the coordination mechanism, resource integration mechanism and information sharing mechanism, and accelerated the formation of the pattern of co-construction, co-management and co-governance. Strengthen dialectical thinking and optimize the development mechanism of economic and national defense construction. Correctly handling the dialectical relationship between economic construction and national defense construction is the main task of cross-military governance. It is necessary to adhere to the overall coordination and military-civilian balance, and play the role of two-way support and pull of economic construction and national defense construction; it is also necessary to seize the main contradictions and the main aspects of the contradictions, firmly establish a clear orientation of the strong military and military development, and actively use the results of economic and social development to accelerate the pace of modernization of the national defense and the army. At the same time, it should also focus on the use of market mechanisms to form the internal momentum of military resources integration and mutual reinforcement, and promote the coordination of economic construction and national defense construction and balanced and compatible development. Strengthen the rule of law thinking, and enhance the level of rule of law in cross-military governance. The rule of law is the basic way of governance. The cross-functional management of cross-military areas and the sensitivity of coordination matters particularly require the rule of law to achieve a high level of governance. We should make good use of the rule of law thinking and the rule of law, give full play to the normative, guiding and safeguarding roles of laws and regulations, focus on strengthening the convergence of military policies and systems, and speed up the work of enacting, reforming, abolishing and interpreting relevant laws and regulations, so as to optimize the institutional environment. Strengthen the top-level planning and system design of cross-military policies and systems, enhance cross-field, cross-sectoral and cross-military coordination of policy and system construction, increase coordination and decision-making on important legislative matters, and strive to realize the normalization and standardization of the integration, synergy and linkage of military regulations and system construction. Strengthen bottom-line thinking and enhance joint supervision across military and land. Due to the dispersion of management functions between the military and the land, there are still regulatory weaknesses in some cross-military areas, with all kinds of hidden factors. To strengthen cross-military governance, we should firmly establish a bottom-line thinking, do a good job of risk assessment, strengthen the military cross-border supervision and governance, improve risk prevention and control capabilities, and strive to create a clean and positive ecological environment. It should further establish and improve the cross-sectoral comprehensive supervision system, improve the coordinated supervision mechanism, and enhance the effectiveness and precision of supervision. Form a cross-military working pattern with each department performing its own duties, closely collaborating, and regulating in an orderly manner Adhere to make greater efforts in integration, continuously optimize the institutional mechanism, improve the organizational system, and sound the policy system, so as to accelerate the formation of a cross-military working pattern with each department performing its own duties, closely collaborating, and regulating in an orderly manner. Continuously optimize the institutional mechanism. To strengthen cross-military governance, it is necessary to further strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the cross-military field, improve the construction of cross-military decision-making and deliberative bodies, and strengthen the functions of top-level design, comprehensive coordination, overall promotion and supervision of implementation. The system optimizes the list of responsibilities of various departments in the military and the land, regulates the functions and authorities of the military and the land organs in accordance with the law, pays attention to clarifying the boundaries of responsibilities between the military and the local authorities, refines the specific division of labor, and optimizes the procedures and processes. Improve the organizational system. To strengthen cross-military governance, it is necessary to use coordination, organization, control and other methods and means to strengthen the whole process of management of integrated decision-making, organization and implementation, supervision and evaluation, to maximize the cohesion of consensus, resolve contradictions, and form synergies, and to effectively transform the advantages of governance into the effectiveness of governance. It has improved and perfected the working system and mechanism of integrated decision-making, clear division of labor, horizontal synergy and vertical integration, fully mobilized the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of all parties, and made it possible to put in place the responsibilities, measures and implementation. Strengthen the assessment and supervision of cross-military special planning, major projects, major reforms, and major policies, and incorporate major cross-military matters such as project approval into the scope of decision-making and governance in accordance with the law, so as to ensure scientific decision-making. Improving the policy system. Strengthen the organic connection between the reform of military policies and systems and the construction of the national rule of law system, and accelerate the establishment of a systematic, complete, connected and effective incentive system of cross-military policies and systems. Strengthen the joint argumentation, joint formulation and joint release of cross-military field policies and systems. Coordinate to promote cross-military key areas of legislation, optimize the policy system, strengthen the integration of military policies and systems, and continue to carry out policy pilots to form policy synergies. Strengthen the implementation of laws and regulations, focus on safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of participating subjects, and smooth dispute resolution channels such as mediation and arbitration. (Author's unit: Institute of Military Law, Academy of Military Sciences)","The article discusses the importance of strengthening cross-military governance in China.

In his letter to the representatives of the nation's outstanding teachers, President Xi proposed to ""vigorously carry forward the spirit of educators"" and profoundly explained the specific connotations of the spirit of educators, one of the important aspects of which is the ""diligence, diligence, seeking truth and innovation in the attitude of cultivation"", which provides an opportunity to strengthen the construction of the teaching force and promote the high-quality development of education work. This provides a direction for strengthening the construction of the teaching force and promoting the high-quality development of education. ""Good scholars fulfill their reasoning, and good practitioners investigate their difficulties."" To achieve an honorable career, educators should have two conditions, one is to study diligently to increase wisdom, and the other is to practice good teaching. ""No will is enough to travel far, and without diligence it is difficult to accomplish anything."" Diligent learning is the basic premise of standing firm on the podium, focusing on convincing people by reasoning and convincing people by skills. Teachers with thorough theoretical understanding, solid knowledge, diligent teaching attitude and excellent teaching ability can stand firm on the podium and be competent in their duties of ""preaching, teaching and solving puzzles""; Dutiful behavior is the ethical guideline for teaching and educating people, focusing on educating people with morality and transforming people with heart.

""and continue to accumulate experience in finding out the laws of teaching, in the diversity of teaching experience in the growth of competence, with deep and solid knowledge, practical cultivation of feelings, knowledge and action as one, and effectively take up the responsibility for the growth of the students to lead the way. ""Things are not stagnant, the reason is to change."" The more the times develop, the more teachers need to set up the concept of innovative thinking. Seek is the principle of education, education is essentially the dissemination of knowledge, teaching reasoning, requiring teachers to treat science with a scientific attitude, the pursuit of truth in the spirit of truth. Innovation is the source of power to promote the development of education, requiring teachers to innovate teaching methods, the use of information technology, and cultivate more students with innovative thinking and creative ability. In the symposium of the representatives of national outstanding teachers, there are many models of innovation and dedication - Li Yu-Nan, a special teacher, created the ""self-study-discussion-guidance"" teaching method in practice; Shi Ning-Zhong, a national model of teaching and education, put forward the ""four basics"" and the ""four basic principles"" as the basis for the development of education. Shi Ningzhong, a national model of teaching and education, put forward the core curriculum theory of mathematics such as ""four fundamentals"", ""four abilities"" and ""three skills"", laying the theoretical foundation for the reform of primary and secondary mathematics curriculum; ""The Most Beautiful Teacher"" Zhang Renli implemented the ""Self-learning, Discussion and Guidance"" teaching method. Zhang Renli, the ""Most Beautiful Teacher"", implemented the ""teahouse-style"" teaching, making the vision of ""light burden, high quality"" education a reality; and so on. ""Being a guide for students' innovative thinking"" is one of President Xi's ardent expectations for teachers to be ""four guides"", and ""creating a highly qualified, specialized and innovative teaching force that satisfies the Party and the people"" is one of the main reasons for the country's comprehensive deepening of the new education system.

The only way to stir up the power of reform and innovation in education is to change, advance and innovate according to the times. The only way for teachers to better adapt to the trend of the times is to maintain a sense of innovation and continue to optimize teaching methods, so as to achieve the development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and the cultivation of talents as a whole. Strong talent is the cause of strong, the rise of talent is the rise of the army. Being in a situation of great change that has not been seen in a hundred years, being in a great era of world military change, for the cause of war education, if there is no distinctive point of good planning to win, will lose the balance of the enemy's backbone, there is no study of the war war war, will lack of the enemy's magic weapon to win. President Xi emphasized: ""We should take the ability to fight and win wars as the starting point and finishing point of talent work, closely follow the trend of the evolution of war patterns, and improve the ability and level of supply of talent to prepare for and fight wars.""

思想战线丨宣传思想文化工作要有新气象新作为 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李海青 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-10-30 06:19:42 0,宣传思想文化工作要有新气象新作为 ■李海青 宣传思想文化工作是一项极端重要的工作，高度重视并切实做好宣传思想文化工作是党的优良传统与宝贵经验。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央站在全局和战略高度，对宣传思想文化工作作出系统谋划和部署，推动新时代宣传思想文化事业取得历史性成就，意识形态领域形势发生全局性、根本性转变，全党全国各族人民文化自信明显增强、全社会凝聚力和向心力极大提升，精神面貌更加奋发昂扬。新时代新征程，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，中华民族伟大复兴进入关键时期，战略机遇和风险挑战并存，宣传思想文化工作面临新形势新任务，必须要有新气象新作为。 一 经过全党全国各族人民持续奋斗，我们实现了第一个百年奋斗目标，在中华大地上全面建成了小康社会，已经迈上全面建设社会主义现代化国家、向第二个百年奋斗目标进军的新征程。今天，我们比历史上任何时期都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴的目标。 要清醒认识到，中华民族伟大复兴，绝不是轻轻松松、敲锣打鼓就能实现的。前进道路上，我们面临的风险考验只会越来越复杂。具体到宣传思想文化工作领域，我们既要看到已经打下的坚实理论基础、实践基础、物质基础、民心基础，也要居安思危，坚持底线思维，保持战略定力，深刻认识和有效应对各种可以预见和难以预见的风险挑战。从国内看，实现中华民族伟大复兴正处于关键时期，统一思想、凝聚力量任务之艰巨前所未有；从国际看，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，增强国际话语权、提升国家文化软实力任务之艰巨前所未有；从意识形态领域看，思想文化相互激荡、价值观念多元多样，建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态任务之艰巨前所未有；从信息化发展趋势看，新一轮科技革命带来传播格局深刻变革，改进创新宣传思想文化工作任务之艰巨前所未有。在此意义上，推动宣传思想文化工作高质量发展，是时代所需、使命所系、人民所盼。 新时代新征程，面对新形势新任务，宣传思想文化工作必须立足新方位、找准新坐标，主动识变应变求变，抓住历史机遇，应对风险挑战，坚持守正创新，自觉肩负起时代赋予的使命任务，开创新时代宣传思想文化工作新局面。 二 党的十八大以来，习近平总书记把宣传思想文化工作摆在治国理政的重要位置，在新时代文化建设方面提出了一系列新思想新观点新论断。具体而言，主要包括：强调文化自信是更基本、更深沉、更持久的力量；强调坚持和发展马克思主义，必须同中华优秀传统文化相结合；强调推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展；强调用社会主义核心价值观铸魂育人，完善思想政治工作体系；强调激发全民族文化创新创造活力，建设社会主义文化强国；强调繁荣发展文化事业和文化产业；强调坚持以人民为中心的创作导向，推出更多增强人民精神力量的优秀作品；强调深化文明交流互鉴，推动中华文化更好走向世界；等等。 习近平文化思想作为习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的“文化篇”，是新时代党领导文化建设实践经验的理论总结，丰富和发展了马克思主义文化理论，大大深化了我们党对建设什么样的中国特色社会主义文化、如何建设中国特色社会主义文化这一重大问题的认识，标志着我们党对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的认识达到了新高度。这一思想既有文化理论观点上的创新和突破，又有文化工作布局上的部署要求，明体达用、体用贯通，明确了新时代文化建设的路线图和任务书，为做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作、担负起新的文化使命提供了强大思想武器和科学行动指南。 习近平文化思想是一个不断发展的、开放的思想体系，必将随着实践深入而不断丰富发展。全党要深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，增进对习近平文化思想的政治认同、思想认同、理论认同、情感认同，持续加强对习近平文化思想的学习、研究、阐释，并自觉贯彻落实到新时代宣传思想文化工作各方面和全过程。 三 新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作作为一项具有全局性、战略性、长远性的系统工程，必须在习近平文化思想指导下进行科学的顶层设计与战略规划。 习近平总书记在对宣传思想文化工作作出的重要指示中，明确指出了新时代新征程做好宣传思想文化工作的指导思想、首要政治任务、新的文化使命、基本原则、着力点以及根本任务，为进一步做好宣传思想文化工作指明了方向。指导思想即坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，全面贯彻党的二十大精神；首要政治任务是用党的创新理论武装全党、教育人民；新的文化使命是在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明；基本原则是坚定文化自信，秉持开放包容，坚持守正创新；“七个着力”是着力加强党对宣传思想文化工作的领导，着力建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态，着力培育和践行社会主义核心价值观，着力提升新闻舆论传播力引导力影响力公信力，着力赓续中华文脉、推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化和创新性发展，着力推动文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展，着力加强国际传播能力建设、促进文明交流互鉴；根本任务是充分激发全民族文化创新创造活力，不断巩固全党全国各族人民团结奋斗的共同思想基础，不断提升国家文化软实力和中华文化影响力，为全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴提供坚强思想保证、强大精神力量、有利文化条件。 习近平总书记关于新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作的顶层设计与战略规划高屋建瓴、精辟深邃，既有认识论又有方法论，既有宏观层面的整体指导，又有具体层面的实践路径，各方面内容紧密联系、相互贯通、有机统一，体现科学性、富有战略性、具有系统性，为我们进一步做好宣传思想文化工作提供了根本遵循。 四 这次全国宣传思想文化工作会议进一步明确了相关的任务部署：巩固壮大奋进新时代的主流思想舆论，以强信心为重点加强正面宣传，提高舆论引导能力；广泛践行社会主义核心价值观，改进创新精神文明建设工作；促进文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展，推动中华优秀传统文化保护传承；加强和改进对外宣传工作，增强中华文明传播力影响力；坚决有效防范化解意识形态风险，敢于亮剑、敢于斗争；加强党对宣传思想文化工作的全面领导，落实政治责任，勇于改革创新，强化法治保障，建强干部人才队伍，为担负起新的文化使命提供坚强政治保证。 一分部署，九分落实。面对光荣使命、艰巨任务和复杂形势，宣传思想文化工作要紧紧围绕学习贯彻习近平文化思想，围绕贯彻党的二十大关于文化建设的战略部署和这次会议的任务部署，切实增强做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作的责任感使命感，瞄准目标、抓住重点、拿出措施，以钉钉子精神把各项任务要求落到实处，推动各项工作落地见效。特别是各级党委（党组）要把做好宣传思想文化工作作为重大政治责任扛在肩上，各级宣传文化部门要强化政治担当，勇于改革创新，敢于斗争，善于斗争，不断开创新时代宣传思想文化工作新局面。 ［作者单位：中央党校（国家行政学院）习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心］,https://web.archive.org/web/20231030234524/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16262992.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231030011146/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16262992.html,2023-10-31 0:00:00,Thought Front丨Propaganda and ideological and cultural work should have a new appearance and new action Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Li Haiqing Responsibility：Yixi Ram 2023-10-30 06:19:42 0,"Propaganda, ideological and cultural work should have a new image and new action ■ Li Haiqing Propaganda, ideological and cultural work is an extremely important work, attach great importance to and effectively do a good job of propaganda, ideological and cultural work is the party's fine tradition and valuable experience. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has made systematic planning and deployment of publicity, ideology and cultural work at an overall and strategic level, promoting the cause of publicity, ideology and culture in the new era to make historic achievements, and the situation in the field of ideology has undergone a global and fundamental transformation, with the whole party and the whole nation's cultural self-confidence significantly strengthened, and the cohesion and centripetal force of the whole society greatly enhanced. The spirit of the Party has become more energetic and high-spirited. A new era and a new journey, the world's century-old changes are accelerating, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered a critical period of strategic opportunities and risks and challenges, the propaganda and ideological work is faced with a new situation and new tasks, there must be a new look and new action. After the sustained struggle of the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups, we have achieved the first hundred years of struggle, built a moderately prosperous society on the Chinese soil, and have embarked on a new journey to build a socialist modernized country in all aspects and march towards the second hundred years of struggle. Today, we are closer to, more confident in and more capable of realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history. We should be soberly aware that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can by no means be achieved easily or with a gong or a drum. On the way forward, the risks and tests we face will only become more and more complicated. Specifically in the field of propaganda, ideological and cultural work, we should not only see the solid theoretical foundation, practical foundation, material foundation, and the foundation of the people's hearts, but also be vigilant in peace, adhere to the bottom line thinking, maintain strategic stability, and profoundly understand and effectively respond to a variety of foreseen and unforeseen risks and challenges. Domestically, the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is at a critical period, and the task of unifying thoughts and gathering strength is unprecedented; internationally, the world's unprecedented changes are accelerating, and the task of strengthening international discourse and enhancing the country's cultural soft power is unprecedented; from the field of ideology, ideologies and cultures are mutually exciting, and values are pluralistic and diversified, so it is an unprecedented task to build a socialist ideology with strong cohesive force and leading power. In the field of ideology, as ideologies and cultures are mutually agitating and values are diversified, the task of building a socialist ideology with strong cohesive and leading power is unprecedented; in the development trend of informationization, the new round of technological revolution has brought about profound changes in the pattern of communication, and the task of improving and innovating propaganda, ideology and culture is unprecedented. In this sense, promoting the high-quality development of propaganda, ideology and culture is the need of the times, the mission and the expectation of the people. A new era and a new journey, in the face of new situations and new tasks, propaganda, ideological and cultural work must be based on a new position, find new coordinates, take the initiative to recognize change, change and seek change, seize the historical opportunities, respond to the risks and challenges, and adhere to the right and innovation, consciously shoulder the mission entrusted to us by the times, and open up new horizons for the work of propaganda, ideological and cultural work in the new era. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has placed propaganda, ideology and culture at the forefront of governance, and has put forward a series of new ideas and opinions and assertions on cultural construction in the new era. Specifically, these include: emphasizing that cultural confidence is a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring force; stressing that adherence to and development of Marxism must be combined with outstanding traditional Chinese culture; stressing the promotion of creative transformation and innovative development of outstanding traditional Chinese culture; stressing the use of socialist core values to forge souls and educate people, and perfecting the ideological and political work system; stressing that it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, and build a socialist cultural power; emphasizing the prosperous development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries; emphasizing adhering to the people-centered creative orientation and releasing more excellent works that enhance the people's spiritual strength; emphasizing deepening civilization exchanges and mutual understanding, and promoting Chinese culture to better reach out to the world; and so on. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, as the ""cultural chapter"" of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, is a theoretical summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction in the new era, which enriches and develops Marxist cultural theory, and greatly deepens the Party's understanding of the major issue of what kind of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is to be constructed and how socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is to be constructed. It has greatly deepened the Party's understanding of the major issue of what kind of socialist culture to build and how to build socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, marking a new height in the Party's understanding of the laws of socialist cultural construction with Chinese characteristics. This thought has both innovations and breakthroughs in the theoretical viewpoints of culture, as well as deployment requirements on the layout of cultural work, which is clear and coherent, clarifying the roadmap and mission statement of cultural construction in the new era, and providing a powerful ideological weapon and scientific action guide for doing a good job of propagandizing ideological and cultural work in the new era and new journey, and assuming the new mission of culture.

""to enhance the political, ideological, theoretical and emotional recognition of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, continue to strengthen the study, research and interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, and consciously implement it into all aspects of propaganda, ideological and cultural work in the new era and the whole process.

We should be brave enough to take on the heaviest burdens, dare to gnaw on the hardest bones, and be good at picking up the hottest potatoes. People need to have a little bit of spirit, and those who struggle need to be passionate. There is no spirit, the effect of entrepreneurship is very different. In the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of the theme of education work conference, President Xi explicitly asked the majority of party members and cadres ""to boost the spirit of enterprising, take on the role of the spirit of doing"". At present, the careful organization and implementation of the second batch of thematic education, the majority of party members and cadres must be through the theme of education to revitalize the spirit of enterprising, take on the role of the spirit of the spirit of the army, with full enthusiasm and plenty of motivation to devote themselves to the great cause of strengthening the military to build up the army. From the reality, the vast majority of grass-roots party members and cadres can revitalize the spirit, forge ahead and take on the role, but there are still a small number of party members and cadres are not enough energy, twilight has more than one. For example, some of the spirit of atrophy, get by, some muddled, do nothing, there are also shirking responsibilities, do things for show ...... and so on, not only is not conducive to personal growth and progress, but also affects the development of the cause of the party and the people. Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a pioneering cause that has never been seen before, and in the process of moving forward, it is bound to encounter many difficulties and obstacles, and to undergo all kinds of winds and waves, and even the major test of the shocking waves. The majority of party members and cadres should take the second batch of theme education as an opportunity to implement the ""heavy practice"" requirements, drum up the spirit of entrepreneurship, always keep enterprising, dare to be the first, rise to the challenge of the struggle posture, the courage to pick the heaviest burdens, the courage to gnaw on the hardest bones, and good at picking up the hottest potatoes, and resolutely do not do! ""Lying down to muddle through"", and strive to overcome the difficulties, the party's twentieth major blueprint into reality. The tree in the sky, there must be its roots; the water of Huai Shan, there must be its source. Where does the spirit to forge ahead and take charge come from? From the firm ideals and beliefs. Ideal belief is a person's soul, is a reflection of the meaning of life. Firm ideal beliefs from the systematic theoretical cognition. If the party's innovative theories are not often not in-depth and not thorough, it is difficult to maintain a clear mind, the idea is easy to stain the dust. In the theme of education, party members and cadres only firmly grasp the requirements of ""learning ideas"", the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the most important, original study, contact with the actual study, against the work of the study, in order to comprehensively and systematically grasp the basic viewpoints of this thought, the scientific system, adhere to, and utilize the Marxist position and viewpoint method, and continue to be a good example of the concepts and methods of Marxism, which are widely used throughout. Marxist position and viewpoint methods, and constantly enhance the political, ideological, theoretical and emotional identity of the Party's innovative theories. The Party members and cadres can only truly realize the unity of learning, thinking and using, and the unity of knowledge, faith and action, and implant the firm ideals and beliefs in their hearts, integrate them into their posts and embed them in practice, so that they can transform them into the persistent pursuit of the goal, the unremitting progress of their work, the courage to take up the heavy task, and the certainty of their noble sentiments, and effectively take up the mission entrusted to them by the Party and the people. There is a dream to have a goal, there is a goal to have power. In the theme of education to revitalize the spirit of enterprising, playful, must bear in mind the goal. The goal is set, then all the rivers come together; the goal is scattered, then a plate of scattered sand. Lei Feng's goal is to do a ""never rusty screw"", so when the farmer is an excellent tractor driver, when the worker is an advanced worker; He Xiangmei's goal is to become a sharp soldier, so he trained hard all year round, rain or shine; Wang Zhongxin's goal is to ""even more hard work, but also to do a look! "", so he dared to take responsibility, good as, became the launch site of the ""sea pin"" ...... goal the more valuable, the more we need to forge ahead, take on the role. Through the theme of education, party members and cadres must bear in mind the goal of the struggle, firm belief in a strong army, consciously integrate their personal ideals and aspirations into the cause of a strong army, personal growth and the realization of the dream of a strong army is closely integrated, conscientious, play as, things do not take refuge in, righteousness does not run away from the responsibility for the scheduled realization of the army one hundred years of the struggle to make its due contribution. Soldiers are born to overcome. Revitalize the spirit of enterprising, take on the role of the spirit, in the final analysis, in order to train excellent skills, improve the ability to win. Competition, than the real skills; battlefield competition, the fight is hard skills. ""Rope short can not draw a deep well, shallow water is difficult to negative big boat."" Theme education can not go deep and practical, there is no see line see effect, an important test standard is to see the quality of officers and soldiers have not improved, there is no enhancement of the ability. In particular, we should see that the era of the requirements of a strong country and strong army, the majority of officers and soldiers of the ability to put forward a higher demand for quality. Today do not charge, tomorrow stand aside; skills are not replaced, sooner or later be replaced. Theme education, the majority of party members and cadres should always be worried, often think of inadequacies, follow the modern war constantly learning to upgrade, follow the frontiers of science and technology to take the initiative to expand capacity, closely follow the development of the times to pursue the quality of transformation, and constantly improve the ability to train and prepare for war, ""war"", ""with the new quantity! ""The goal of the theme of education is to put into practice the requirements of a strong ability to win. At all levels should be carried out in-depth ""based on the post to make contributions"" activities, through the establishment of party members demonstration post, party members responsibility area, the organization of party members commitment to fulfill the promise, post training, learning to catch up, in the completion of the central task, the implementation of major tasks in the hammering of competence.

增强做好宣传思想文化工作责任感使命感 来源：中国军网-解放军报 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-03 06:30:24 0,增强做好宣传思想文化工作责任感使命感 ■国防大学政治学院 近日，习主席对宣传思想文化工作作出重要指示，从全局和战略高度，充分肯定党的十八大以来宣传思想文化事业取得的历史性成就，深刻阐述宣传思想文化工作的重要地位作用，对全面贯彻党的二十大精神、担负起新的文化使命、做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作提出了明确要求。我们要深入学习贯彻习主席重要指示和全国宣传思想文化工作会议精神，切实增强做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作责任感使命感，推动各项工作落地见效。 一 习主席指出：“宣传思想文化工作事关党的前途命运，事关国家长治久安，事关民族凝聚力和向心力，是一项极端重要的工作。”我们要站在强国建设、民族复兴的战略高度，进一步增强做好宣传思想文化工作的自觉性。 事关党的前途命运。中国共产党是中国特色社会主义事业的领导核心，做好宣传思想文化工作对于坚持党的领导、巩固党的执政地位具有重要意义。从党和国家事业发展看，宣传思想文化工作做好了，党的群众基础和执政基础才能更加巩固。宣传思想文化工作也与中国式现代化息息相关，中国式现代化是物质文明和精神文明相协调的现代化，没有社会主义文化繁荣发展，就没有社会主义现代化，必须推动物质文明和精神文明协调发展。从外部风险挑战看，敌对势力颠覆中国共产党领导和我国社会主义制度的图谋现实存在，必须做好两种社会制度、两种意识形态长期斗争的准备。这些都决定了宣传思想文化工作一刻也不能放松、一点也不能削弱。 事关国家长治久安。一个政权的瓦解往往从思想领域开始。苏联解体的一个重要原因就是意识形态领域出了严重问题。历史和现实警示我们，思想舆论阵地一旦被突破，其他防线就很难守得住。当前，世界进入新的动荡变革期，世界范围的意识形态斗争更加尖锐复杂，要维护我国政治安全、文化安全、意识形态安全，确保中国特色社会主义事业行稳致远，必须把宣传思想文化工作摆在全局工作的重要位置。 事关民族凝聚力和向心力。文化是凝聚人心的精神纽带。党的十八大以来，习主席对宣传思想文化工作作出系统谋划和部署，推动新时代宣传思想文化事业取得历史性成就，意识形态领域形势发生全局性、根本性转变，全党全军全国各族人民文化自信明显增强、精神面貌更加奋发昂扬，全社会凝聚力和向心力极大提升，这为新时代开创党和国家事业新局面提供了坚强思想保证和强大精神力量。新征程上，必须以卓有成效的宣传思想文化工作，确保全国各族人民心往一处想、劲往一处使，为推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业凝聚强大精神力量。 二 习近平文化思想是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的文化篇，丰富和发展了马克思主义文化理论，标志着我们党对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的认识达到了新高度，为做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作提供了强大思想武器和科学行动指南。 聚焦首要政治任务。宣传思想文化工作首要政治任务，是用党的创新理论武装全党、教育人民。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是当代中国马克思主义、二十一世纪马克思主义，是中华文化和中国精神的时代精华，实现了马克思主义中国化时代化新的飞跃，为我们认识世界和改造世界提供了强大思想武器。新时代新征程，必须坚持不懈用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想凝心铸魂，持续加强对习近平文化思想的学习、研究、阐释，健全用党的创新理论武装全党、教育人民、指导实践的工作体系，切实把党的创新理论转化为认识世界、改造世界的强大力量。 担负新的文化使命。宣传思想文化工作新的文化使命，是在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明。这一新的文化使命充分彰显了我们党对“文化是一个国家、一个民族的灵魂”的深刻认识，充分揭示了“没有高度的文化自信，没有文化的繁荣兴盛，就没有中华民族伟大复兴”的内在逻辑，充分体现了“建设社会主义文化强国”的战略性部署。新时代新征程，必须扎实做好宣传思想文化工作，激发全民族文化创新创造活力，不断铸就社会主义文化新辉煌，不断增强实现中华民族伟大复兴的精神力量。 必须坚持基本原则。宣传思想文化工作必须坚持的基本原则，是坚定文化自信、秉持开放包容、坚持守正创新。文化自信是一个国家、一个民族发展中更根本、更深沉、更持久的力量。坚定中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信，说到底是要坚定文化自信，必须推进文化自信自强。文明的繁盛、人类的进步，离不开文明交流、互学互鉴，必须以开放包容的态度、兼收并蓄的胸怀，学习借鉴人类文明优秀成果，在推动各国文明交流互鉴中书写人类文明新篇章。文化是最需要创新的领域，必须坚持守正创新，在实践创造中进行文化创造，在历史进步中实现文化进步，使中国特色社会主义文化始终反映时代精神、引领时代潮流。 把握“七个着力”要求。宣传思想文化工作要着力加强党对宣传思想文化工作的领导，着力建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态，着力培育和践行社会主义核心价值观，着力提升新闻舆论传播力引导力影响力公信力，着力赓续中华文脉、推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化和创新性发展，着力推动文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展，着力加强国际传播能力建设、促进文明交流互鉴。“七个着力”凝结着我们党领导宣传思想文化工作的历史经验，着眼于宣传思想文化工作面临的新形势新任务，明确了新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作的路线图和任务书，必须坚决贯彻落实。 三 新时代新征程，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，中华民族伟大复兴进入关键时期，战略机遇和风险挑战并存，宣传思想文化工作面临新形势新任务，必须要有新气象新作为。 强化政治担当。要增强做好宣传思想文化工作的政治责任感，把责任扛在肩上，确保党中央决策部署落到实处。要深刻认识党的十八大以来宣传思想文化工作取得的历史性成就，坚持马克思主义在意识形态领域指导地位不动摇，坚持党管宣传、党管意识形态、党管媒体，牢牢掌握意识形态工作领导权，建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态。要以高度政治自觉对宣传思想文化领域重大问题进行分析研判、对重大战略任务进行统筹指导，善于从政治上看问题，带头把方向、抓导向、管阵地、强队伍，做到政治立场不移、政治方向不偏。要全面落实意识形态工作责任制，加强意识形态阵地建设和管理，壮大主流思想舆论，破除各种错误思潮，强化问责刚性约束，做到守土有责、守土负责、守土尽责。 勇于改革创新。当前，各种思想文化不断交流交融交锋，观念意识日益多元多样多变，宣传思想文化工作比以往任何时候都更加需要因时而变、因势而动。要深入总结我们党关于宣传思想文化工作的宝贵历史经验，把握理念创新、手段创新、基层工作创新等的原则方法，不断提高以改革创新推动宣传思想文化工作发展的意识和能力。要强化问题导向，深入分析宣传思想文化工作面临的新机遇新挑战，紧密跟踪最新思想动向、社会热点问题，坚决克服脱离生活、不接地气等问题，不断增强宣传思想文化工作的主动性、针对性和实效性。要创新话语表达，加快传统媒体与新兴媒体融合发展，充分运用新技术新应用创新传播方式，占领信息传播制高点，着力增强宣传思想文化工作的时代感和吸引力。 敢于善于斗争。宣传思想文化阵地我们不去占领，别人就会去占领，必须敢于斗争、善于斗争，实现占领阵地、建设阵地和守牢阵地的有机统一。要发扬斗争精神，敢抓敢管、敢于亮剑，不做“骑墙派”和“看风派”，不做所谓“开明绅士”，不搞“爱惜羽毛”，对恶意攻击党的领导、攻击社会主义制度等错误言论，要旗帜鲜明予以批驳、及时果断加以处置。要提升斗争本领，注意区分政治原则问题、思想认识问题、学术观点问题，把握好时度效，用真理揭露谎言，让科学战胜谬误，靠深入细致的工作帮助群众划清是非界限、澄清模糊认识，弘扬主旋律，传播正能量，激发全社会团结奋进的强大力量。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231105235549/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16264183.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103180052/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16264183.html,2023-11-06 0:00:00,"Enhance the sense of responsibility and mission to do a good job in propaganda, ideology and culture Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Editor in Chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-03 06:30:24 0","Enhance the sense of responsibility and sense of mission to do a good job of propaganda, ideology and culture ■ College of Political Science, National Defense University Recently, President Xi made an important instruction on propaganda, ideology and culture, from the overall situation and strategic height, fully affirmed the historic achievements of propaganda, ideology and culture since the 18th CPC National Congress, profoundly elaborated on the important status of propaganda, ideology and culture, and comprehensively carried out the spirit of the twentieth CPC National Congress, and took up the new cultural mission, We have put forward clear requirements for the comprehensive implementation of the spirit of the 20th Party Congress, taking up the new cultural mission, and doing a good job of propaganda, ideology and culture in the new era and new journey. We need to study and implement President Xi's important instructions and the spirit of the National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology and Culture, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and mission to do a good job of propaganda, ideology and culture in the new era and the new journey, and to promote the effectiveness of all the work on the ground. A President Xi pointed out that ""propaganda, ideology and culture work is related to the future destiny of the party, the long-term stability of the country, the cohesion and centripetal force of the nation, and is an extremely important work."" We should stand on the strategic height of the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation, and further enhance the conscientiousness of doing a good job in propaganda, ideology and culture. The future destiny of the Party is at stake. The CPC is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and doing a good job in propaganda, ideology and culture is of great significance in adhering to the Party's leadership and consolidating the Party's ruling position. From the perspective of the development of the Party and the country's cause, the Party's mass base and ruling foundation can only be more consolidated if the propaganda, ideological and cultural work is done well. Propaganda, ideological and cultural work is also closely related to Chinese-style modernization, which is a modernization that coordinates material civilization and spiritual civilization; there can be no socialist modernization without the prosperous development of socialist culture, and it is necessary to promote the coordinated development of material civilization and spiritual civilization. In terms of external risks and challenges, the attempts of hostile forces to subvert the leadership of the CPC and China's socialist system are a reality, and we must be prepared for a long-term struggle between two social systems and two ideologies. All these dictate that the work of propaganda, ideology and culture should not be relaxed or weakened for a single moment. The long-term stability of the country is at stake. The disintegration of a regime often begins in the realm of ideas. One of the major reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union was that there were serious problems in the ideological field. History and reality warn us that once the ideological and public opinion positions are breached, it will be difficult to defend other lines of defense. At present, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change, and the worldwide ideological struggle has become more acute and complex. To safeguard China's political, cultural, and ideological security, and to ensure that the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics is stable and far-reaching, it is necessary to place propaganda, ideological and cultural work in an important position in the overall work. It is a matter of national cohesion and centripetal force. Culture is the spiritual bond that unites people.

学习要论丨以新的文化使命谱写中华文明时代华章 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：臧峰宇 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-08 06:13:27 0,以新的文化使命谱写中华文明时代华章 ■臧峰宇 习近平文化思想开辟了马克思主义文化理论发展的新境界，为我们全面深入了解中华文明史，掌握“两个结合”的科学方法，努力建设中华民族现代文明，提供了科学理论指南。新时代新征程，我们要持续加强对习近平文化思想的学习、研究、阐释，担负起在新的起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明这一新的文化使命，坚定文化自信，秉持开放包容，坚持守正创新，以生生不息、欣欣向荣的文化力量谱写中华文明时代华章。 一 只有全面深入了解中华文明的历史，才能更有效地推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展，更有力地推进中国特色社会主义文化建设，建设中华民族现代文明。我们要把握中华优秀传统文化中蕴含的思想观念、人文精神、道德规范，用大历史观观察中华民族的发展历程，阐明中华文明自我发展、回应挑战、开创新局的文化主体性和旺盛生命力，揭示中华优秀传统文化的精神品格和价值追求，夯实文化自信的历史根基。 中华文明的演进，有自身规律和民族特点。全面深入了解中华文明的历史，既要走向历史深处，也要从历史深处走来。着眼于中华文明的未来走向，眺望人类文明的制高点，我们要以文化古今相通和文明交流互鉴的思路把握中华文明从“过去之我”“现在之我”走向“未来之我”的内在逻辑，理解其中丰富的思想内涵，从中汲取自立自信自强的营养，更好担负起新的文化使命。要将文化自信作为中国特色社会主义事业发展的精神支撑，探究符合时代发展需要的文化创新机制，努力在新的历史起点上构筑中华民族共有的精神家园。 中华优秀传统文化是中华文明的智慧结晶和精华所在。习近平总书记将中华优秀传统文化的重要元素精炼概括为“天下为公、天下大同的社会理想，民为邦本、为政以德的治理思想，九州共贯、多元一体的大一统传统，修齐治平、兴亡有责的家国情怀，厚德载物、明德弘道的精神追求，富民厚生、义利兼顾的经济伦理，天人合一、万物并育的生态理念，实事求是、知行合一的哲学思想，执两用中、守中致和的思维方法，讲信修睦、亲仁善邻的交往之道”。中华优秀传统文化是中华民族传承发展的根本，是在历史中形成并在人们现实生活中依然发挥作用的思维方式、价值观念、道德原则和生活方式。今天，我们要深刻理解中华民族的文化自我，体悟“收百世之阙文，采千载之遗韵”的文化气魄，融通中外、贯通古今，使中华优秀传统文化焕发时代风采，为我们进行文化创新和文明创造提供丰厚滋养。 文化是民族生存和发展的重要力量。中华文明具有连续性、创新性、统一性、包容性、和平性等突出特性，在长期的历史发展中形成了多元一体的中华民族，并赋予中华民族坚定文化自信的充足底气。自古以来无数有识之士埋头苦干、拼命硬干、为民请命和舍身求法的实践，映现出中华优秀传统文化的思想光芒，为中华民族持续发展提供了悠远绵长的精神力量。只有以历史自信和文化自信不断提振民族精神，在实践中深刻彰显时代精神，不断发展面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来的，民族的科学的大众的文化，中华民族才能在世界民族之林中巍然屹立，稳步前进。 二 习近平总书记在党的二十大报告中强调：“只有把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合，坚持运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，才能正确回答时代和实践提出的重大问题，才能始终保持马克思主义的蓬勃生机和旺盛活力。”前进道路上，我们要坚持“两个结合”的科学方法，深刻认识马克思主义既同中国革命、建设、改革和新时代伟大变革的实践相结合，又在体现中国风格和中国气派的过程中实际促进了中华优秀传统文化的时代转化。 坚持“两个结合”的科学方法，要深入研究其内在机理和实践逻辑，并贯通于人民群众创造美好生活的文化实践中，持续巩固我们的文化主体性。前进道路上，我们要遵循明体达用、体用贯通的思想方法，促进理论与实践相结合，在中国式现代化的实践创造中做到知行合一，使新的文化生命体彰显强大的价值引领力、文化凝聚力和精神推动力。 坚持“两个结合”的科学方法，要深刻认识到，马克思主义思想精髓同中华优秀传统文化精华在实践场域产生“化学反应”，造就了一个有机统一的新的文化生命体。作为推进理论创新的科学方法，“两个结合”为我们认识世界和改造世界提供了强大的思想武器，形成了具有引领力、凝聚力、塑造力、辐射力的社会主义先进文化，使九州共贯、万物并育、富民厚生转换为中华民族共同体意识、人与自然和谐共生理念、共同富裕的价值原则，开辟了马克思主义中国化时代化新境界。 坚持“两个结合”的科学方法，要以辩证思维理解马克思主义同中华优秀传统文化诸多契合之处。彼此契合是实现二者结合的前提，在结合中丰盈了马克思主义的中国化时代化形式，使之彰显中国风格和中国气派；在结合中推动了中华文明的生命更新和现代转型，实现了中华文化从传统到现代的跨越，筑牢了中国式现代化道路的文化根基。马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化相结合的结果是互相成就，让马克思主义成为中国的，让中华优秀传统文化成为现代的，让经由“结合”而形成的新文化成为中国式现代化的文化形态。 坚持“两个结合”的科学方法，要以系统观念和创新思维掌握思想和文化主动。“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放，拓展了中国特色社会主义道路的文化根基。在中国式现代化进程中，我们要以唯物辩证法关于联系、整体、发展的观点认识发展任务艰巨繁重、发展环境快速变化、发展中的矛盾错综复杂、发展不平衡不充分等问题，补充、拓展、完善中华优秀传统文化的时代内涵，使之实现创造性转化、创新性发展，以新思路、新话语、新机制和新形式创造属于我们这个时代的新文化。 三 文化兴则国运兴，文化强则民族强。习近平总书记指出：“任何文化要立得住、行得远，要有引领力、凝聚力、塑造力、辐射力，就必须有自己的主体性。”中华民族现代文明是我们在新的历史条件下的自觉创造，是实现文化发展和实践创造的文明结晶，是包括物质文明、政治文明、精神文明、社会文明、生态文明在内的有机整体，体现了中国共产党人在新时代新征程上的精神气象，是汇聚中华儿女共同奋斗、实现中华民族伟大复兴的强大精神动力。 中华民族现代文明是在中国式现代化进程中积淀和发展的，具有鲜明的中国风格和时代内涵。一部中华民族现代文明史，是在中国式现代化进程中延展的，是在马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际和中华优秀传统文化相结合的实践探索中凝结的。体现时代精神的文化发展要贯通古今、融通中外，“外之既不后于世界之思潮，内之仍弗失固有之血脉”。今天，我们要以新的文化使命迈向文化发展新高度，把握以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的文化主线，进一步阐明中国特色社会主义文化发展规律，理解人民群众日益增长的美好生活需要的文化蕴涵，推动中国特色社会主义文化繁荣兴盛，使文化成果更多更好地惠及全体人民。 建设中华民族现代文明，是中国式现代化的必然要求。中华文明赋予中国式现代化以深厚底蕴，中国式现代化赋予中华文明以现代力量，推动中华文明由传统向现代转型。中国式现代化蕴含的独特世界观、价值观、历史观、文明观、民主观、生态观，为建设中华民族现代文明提供了实践基础上的观念前提。前进道路上，我们要深入学习贯彻习近平文化思想，立足中华民族伟大历史实践和当代实践，以文化主体性创造未来，以民族精神和时代精神为底气创造人类文明新形态。要努力将中华民族悠久的历史文化传承与现代经济发展活力结合起来，深刻理解中国式现代化的文化逻辑，深入理解中华文明现代发展规律，有力激活中华民族的文化创造力。要繁荣发展文化事业和文化产业，提高全社会文明程度，实现中华文明与现代化的融合发展，以新的文化使命奋力谱写中华文明时代华章。 建设中华民族现代文明，是维护人类和平所需。自古以来，中华文明就具有开放包容特质，其蕴含的全人类共同价值，倡导以文明交流超越文明隔阂，以文明互鉴超越文明冲突，以文明共存超越文明优越。中华文明所具有的突出和平性，决定了中国始终是世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者。前进道路上，我们应秉持构建人类命运共同体理念，弘扬平等、互鉴、对话、包容的文明观，加强文明交流互鉴，形成兼容并蓄、博采众长的格局和气象，促进中华文化更好走向世界，以新的文化生命体化解冲突、凝聚共识，为促进世界和平与发展不断作出积极贡献。 （作者系中国人民大学哲学院院长、教授）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109000431/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265414.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108075812/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265414.html,2023-11-09 0:00:00,Study Essentials丨Write the era of Chinese civilization with a new cultural mission Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zang Fengyu Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-08 06:13:27 0,"Composing the era of Chinese civilization with a new cultural mission ■ Zang Fengyu Xi Jinping's cultural thought opens up a new realm of Marxist cultural theory development, providing a scientific theoretical guide for us to understand the history of Chinese civilization in depth, master the scientific method of ""two combinations"", and work hard to build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation. In the new era and new journey, we should continue to strengthen the study, research and interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, take up the new cultural mission of continuing to promote cultural prosperity, building a strong cultural country, and building a modern civilization of the Chinese nation from a new starting point, firmly establish cultural self-confidence, uphold openness and inclusiveness, and insist on observing the correctness and innovation, so that we can write the era's chapter of Chinese civilization with unceasingly thriving cultural power. Only through a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the history of Chinese civilization can we more effectively promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, more vigorously promote the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, and build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation. We need to grasp the ideology, humanistic spirit, and moral norms embedded in Chinese outstanding traditional culture, observe the development of the Chinese nation from a broad historical perspective, clarify the cultural subjectivity and vigorous vitality of Chinese civilization in its self-development, response to challenges, and creation of new horizons, and reveal the spiritual character and pursuit of values of Chinese outstanding traditional culture, so as to consolidate the historical foundation of cultural self-confidence. The evolution of Chinese civilization has its own laws and national characteristics. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the history of Chinese civilization is not only about going to the depths of history, but also about coming from the depths of history. Focusing on the future direction of Chinese civilization and the high point of human civilization, we need to grasp the internal logic of Chinese civilization's transition from the ""past self"" to the ""present self"" to the ""future self"", and understand the inherent logic of Chinese civilization's transition from the ""past self"" to the ""present self"", and to the ""future self"", with a view to understanding the evolution of Chinese civilization. We should grasp the internal logic of Chinese civilization's transition from the ""past self"" and ""present self"" to the ""future self"", understand its rich ideological connotation, and learn from it the nourishment of self-reliance, self-confidence and self-improvement, so as to better shoulder the new cultural mission. We should take cultural confidence as the spiritual support for the development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, explore the mechanism of cultural innovation that meets the development needs of the times, and strive to build a common spiritual home for the Chinese nation at the new historical starting point. Excellent traditional Chinese culture is the crystallization of the wisdom and essence of Chinese civilization. General Secretary Xi Jinping has summarized the important elements of Chinese fine traditional culture as ""the social ideal of the world being a commonwealth and the world being a commonwealth, the ideology of governance that the people are the foundation of the state and the government is based on morality, the tradition of unification that is consistent with the nine states and unity in diversity, the family and national sentiments that are responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, the spiritual pursuit of carrying things in a generous manner and promoting the Way of the Lord, and the economic ethic that is to enrich the people and the people and to take into account both righteousness and profit. The ecological concept of unity of heaven and man, the ecological concept of all things, the philosophical idea of seeking truth from facts and unity of knowledge and action, the method of thinking of keeping the two in the middle and keeping the middle in harmony, and the way of communicating with each other of faith and harmony, kindness and good neighborliness"". Excellent traditional Chinese culture is the foundation of the Chinese nation's inheritance and development, and it is the way of thinking, values, ethical principles and way of life that have been formed in history and still play a role in people's real life. Today, we need to deeply understand the cultural self of the Chinese nation, realize the cultural spirit of ""collecting the queer texts of a hundred generations and picking up the legacy of a thousand years"", integrate the Chinese and foreign countries, and connect the ancient and modern worlds, so as to make the excellent traditional Chinese culture glow with the elegance of the times, and to provide abundant nourishment for us to carry out cultural innovation and civilization creation. Culture is an important force for the survival and development of a nation. Chinese civilization, with its outstanding characteristics of continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness, and peacefulness, has formed a pluralistic and integrated Chinese nation over a long period of historical development, and has given the Chinese nation sufficient backing for its firm cultural self-confidence. Since ancient times, the practice of countless men of insight to work hard, work desperately, ask for the people's lives and sacrifice themselves to seek the law has reflected the ideological light of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and has provided the Chinese nation with a long-lasting spiritual power for its sustainable development. Only by constantly revitalizing the spirit of the nation with historical and cultural self-confidence, profoundly manifesting the spirit of the times in practice, and continuously developing a modern, world-oriented, future-oriented, national, scientific and popular culture can the Chinese nation stand tall and steadily move forward in the forest of the world's nations. In his report to the 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, ""Only by combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture, and by adhering to the use of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, can we correctly answer the major questions raised by the times and practices, and maintain the vitality and vigor of Marxism at all times. "" On the way forward, we should adhere to the scientific method of ""two combinations"", and deeply understand that Marxism not only combines with the practice of the Chinese revolution, construction, reform and the great changes of the new era, but also actually promotes the transformation of the excellent traditional Chinese culture in the process of embodying the Chinese style and Chinese flavor. Adhering to the scientific method of ""combining the two"", we need to study in depth its inner mechanism and practical logic, and to integrate it into the cultural practice of the people in creating a better life, so as to continuously consolidate our cultural subjectivity. On the way forward, we should follow the ideological method of understanding the body and achieving the use of the body, promoting the combination of theory and practice, and achieving the unity of knowledge and action in the practical creation of Chinese-style modernization, so that the new cultural vitality can manifest its powerful value-led, cultural cohesion and spiritual impetus. Adhering to the scientific method of ""combining the two"", we should deeply realize that the essence of Marxist thought and the essence of the excellent traditional Chinese culture have produced a ""chemical reaction"" in the field of practice, creating a new organically unified cultural organism. As a scientific method to promote theoretical innovation, the ""two combinations"" provide a powerful ideological weapon for us to understand and transform the world, forming an advanced socialist culture with leading, cohesive, shaping and radiating power, so that the nine states are cohesive, all things are nurtured together, and the richness and generosity of the people are transformed into the sense of community of the Chinese nation, the concept of harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature, and the concept of common wealth and prosperity. The concept of harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature, and the value principle of common prosperity have opened up a new realm for the modernization of Marxism. Adhering to the scientific method of ""combining the two"", we need to use dialectical thinking to understand the many points of convergence between Marxism and Chinese traditional culture. Mutual compatibility is the prerequisite for the realization of the combination of the two, in which the combination has enriched the form of Chinese modernization of Marxism, making it manifest Chinese style and Chinese style; in which the combination has promoted the renewal of the life of Chinese civilization and the modern transformation of Chinese culture, realizing the leap of Chinese culture from tradition to modernity, and building up a firm cultural foundation for the road of Chinese-style modernization. The combination of Marxism and Chinese traditional culture results in mutual achievements, making Marxism Chinese, Chinese traditional culture modern, and the new culture formed through the ""combination"" a cultural form of Chinese modernization. Adhering to the scientific method of the ""two combinations"", we should take the initiative in thought and culture with a systematic concept and innovative thinking. The ""second combination"" is another ideological liberation, expanding the cultural roots of the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the process of Chinese-style modernization, we need to understand the arduous task of development, the rapid changes in the development environment, the intricacies of contradictions in development, and the imbalance and insufficiency of development from the viewpoints of the dialectic of materialism on connection, wholeness, and development, and to supplement, expand, and improve the contemporary connotations of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, so as to realize creative transformation and innovative development, and create a new culture belonging to our era with new ideas, new discourse, new mechanisms, and new forms of development. Create a new culture for our time with new ideas, new words, new mechanisms and new forms. The prosperity of culture is the prosperity of the nation, and the strength of culture is the strength of the nation. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Any culture must have its own subjectivity if it is to stand and travel far, and if it is to have leading, cohesive, shaping and radiating power."" The modern civilization of the Chinese nation is our conscious creation under the new historical conditions, a crystallization of civilization that realizes cultural development and practical creation, an organic whole including material, political, spiritual, social and ecological civilization, embodying the spiritual meteorology of the Chinese Communists in the new journey of the new era, and a powerful spiritual impetus to bring together the Chinese sons and daughters in their common struggle to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation The Chinese people's modern civilization is the result of the Chinese style of civilization. The modern civilization of the Chinese nation has been accumulated and developed in the process of Chinese-style modernization, and has a distinct Chinese style and contemporary connotation. A history of the modern civilization of the Chinese nation is extended in the process of Chinese-style modernization, and condensed in the practical exploration of combining the basic principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China and the excellent traditional Chinese culture. The development of culture that embodies the spirit of the times should be consistent with the past and the present, and integrate the Chinese and foreign cultures, so that ""the external world will not lag behind the world's trend of thinking, and the internal world will not lose its inherent bloodline"". Today, we should take a new cultural mission to a new level of cultural development, grasp the cultural thread of promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization, further elucidate the law of cultural development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, understand the cultural connotation of the growing needs of the people for a better life, promote the prosperity of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, and make the fruits of culture benefit all the people in a greater and better way. Building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation is an inevitable requirement for Chinese-style modernization. Chinese civilization has given Chinese modernization a profound heritage, and Chinese modernization has given Chinese civilization a modern strength, promoting the transformation of Chinese civilization from tradition to modernity. The unique worldview, values, history, civilization, democracy and ecology embedded in Chinese-style modernization provide the conceptual prerequisites for the construction of modern Chinese civilization on the basis of practice. On the way forward, we should study and implement Xi Jinping's cultural thought in depth, base ourselves on the great historical and contemporary practices of the Chinese nation, create the future with cultural subjectivity, and create a new form of human civilization with the underlying spirit of the nation and the spirit of the times. We should strive to combine the long historical and cultural heritage of the Chinese nation with the vitality of modern economic development, deeply understand the cultural logic of Chinese-style modernization, deeply understand the laws of modern development of Chinese civilization, and powerfully activate the cultural creativity of the Chinese nation. It is necessary to prosper and develop cultural undertakings and cultural industries, raise the level of civilization of the whole society, realize the integration and development of Chinese civilization and modernization, and strive to write a magnificent chapter of Chinese civilization in the times with a new cultural mission. Building a modern Chinese civilization is necessary for maintaining human peace. Since ancient times, Chinese civilization has been characterized by openness and inclusiveness, and the common values of all mankind embedded in it advocate civilizational exchanges to transcend civilizational barriers, mutual understanding to transcend the clash of civilizations, and coexistence to transcend the superiority of civilizations. The prominent peaceful nature of Chinese civilization determines that China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. On the way forward, we should uphold the concept of building a community of human destiny, carry forward the concept of equality, mutual appreciation, dialogue and tolerance of civilizations, strengthen civilization exchanges and mutual understanding, form a pattern and weather of compatibility and diversity, promote Chinese culture to better reach out to the world, and make positive contributions to the promotion of world peace and development by resolving conflicts and forging a consensus with a new cultural life form.

在中国式现代化进程中加快推进农业强国建设 来源：光明网-《光明日报》 作者：郑会霞 赵早 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-07 17:05:11 0,党的二十大报告明确提出要加快建设农业强国，为农业现代化发展指明了方向和目标。中国是传统农业大国，农耕文明悠久厚重、影响深远；中国也是农业资源与人口大国，生态资源丰富，但人均资源却相对短缺。中国建设农业强国不能简单照搬国外农业现代化发展模式，而要根据具体国情，聚焦人多地少的资源禀赋、农耕文明的历史底蕴、人与自然和谐共生的时代要求，科学谋划、循序渐进、因地制宜、稳扎稳打，在中国式现代化进程中探索开辟具有中国特色的农业强国之路。 1.加快建设农业强国是推进中国式现代化的必然选择 强国必先强农，农强方能国强。农业，为人类社会的发展提供最基本的生产生活资料，是我们赖以生存和发展的基础，满足人民美好生活需要、实现高质量发展、夯实国家安全基础，都离不开农业发展。在近代以前的很长时间里，无论是东方国家还是西方国家，农业都是孕育文明的母体。即使到了今天，社会分工和文明进步已经到了较高水平，农业仍发挥着最基础的支撑作用，其地位不可替代。农业强国是社会主义现代化强国的根基。无论社会现代化程度有多高，14亿多人口的粮食和重要农产品稳定供给始终是头等大事。 我国社会主义现代化建设的经验表明，农业兴则百业兴。没有农业的积累和支持，就没有中国工业的发展；没有农业的现代化，国家现代化建设也就失去了基础。习近平总书记强调，没有农业强国就没有整个现代化强国；没有农业农村现代化，社会主义现代化就是不全面的。必须把加快建设农业强国摆上建设社会主义现代化强国的重要位置。建设农业强国，基本要求是实现农业现代化。在推进中国式现代化进程中，只有农业强起来，粮食安全有完全保障，我们稳大局、应变局、开新局才有充足底气和战略主动。 进入新发展阶段，面对我国仍处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段的基本国情，面对城乡二元结构没有根本改变、城乡发展差距不断拉大趋势没有根本扭转的历史和现实，以及面对中国农业大而不强、多而不优的发展现状，唯有锚定加快建设农业强国目标，保持战略定力、久久为功，加快制定建设农业强国规划，针对未来5年、2035年、本世纪中叶的目标，分别制定路线图和施工图，强化规划的法规效力，加快补齐农业现代化发展的短板，才能为开启全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程提供有力保障。 同时，我们也要清醒认识到，建设农业强国是一项长期而艰巨的历史任务，要分阶段扎实稳步推进，以钉钉子精神锲而不舍干下去。当前要把重点放在全面推进乡村振兴上，多做打基础、利长远的事情。各地要立足资源禀赋和发展阶段，发挥自身优势，服务大局需要，从本地农业农村发展最迫切、农民反映最强烈的实际问题入手，充分调动农民群众的积极性、主动性、创造性，大力推进农业农村现代化，使农业农村面貌得到显著改善，使农民生活水平大幅提高。 2.农业强国建设的基本要求 农业强国是一个动态的比较概念。如果一国的农业综合生产能力、产业竞争力或农业优势部门现代化水平位居世界前列并能够引领世界农业发展，则可以称之为农业强国。中国从农业大国转变为农业强国，既要遵循农业现代化的一般规律，又要同中国的国情农情相结合，坚守自己的基本要求。 坚持党对农村工作的全面领导。建设农业强国要坚持党领导“三农”工作原则不动摇。中国共产党科学擘画中国式现代化的宏伟蓝图，把握现代农业发展的战略方向，为农业改革发展提供了坚强保障。只有坚持党对农业农村工作的全面领导，才能使之沿着社会主义现代化方向发展。党的十八大以来，我们党始终高度重视加强党对农业农村工作的领导，把实施乡村振兴战略摆在优先位置，不断健全党委统一领导、政府负责、党委农村工作部门统筹协调的农村工作领导体制，落实省市县乡村五级书记抓乡村振兴要求，逐步完善党领导农村工作的组织体系、制度体系、工作机制。当前，加快建设农业强国要进一步发挥好各级党委农村工作领导小组牵头抓总、统筹协调作用，进一步健全村党组织领导的村级组织体系，凝聚各方力量，形成齐抓共管的工作合力，提高新时代党全面领导农村工作的能力和水平，以更大的力度、更实的举措推动农业现代化快速发展，为加快建设农业强国提供坚强政治保证。 坚持走适度规模经营之路。人多地少、农户分散承包经营是中国的国情，决定了中国的农业现代化既不可能在短期内通过流转土地实现大规模集中经营，也不可能走一些发达国家高投入高成本、家家户户设施装备小而全的路子。建设农业强国要充分发挥以家庭承包经营为基础、统分结合的双层经营体制的优势，走适度规模经营之路。一方面，积极培育发展壮大农民合作社、家庭农场等各类新型农业经营主体。另一方面，构建新型农业经营主体与小农户之间的利益联结机制，将现代生产要素有效导入小农户生产，帮助小农户解决一家一户干不了、干不好的事情。这种适度规模经营，既能够有效解决小农户生产存在的效率效益低下、与市场对接能力较弱、科技推广难度大等问题，又符合我国人均耕地少、地区差异较大、土地资源分布不均衡等实际情况，有效促进小农户与现代农业的有机衔接。 立足人与自然和谐共生。我国农业生态资源总量较大，但人均占有量低，资源约束明显。加快建设农业强国，要坚决摒弃无止境地向自然索取甚至破坏自然的发展观，着力避免走“先污染、后治理”的发展老路，牢固树立和践行绿水青山就是金山银山的理念，以生态优先、绿色发展为导向，坚定不移走人与自然和谐共生的现代化发展之路。站在人与自然和谐共生的高度，谋划农业农村绿色发展道路，守住绿水青山，让生态农业、绿色农业、低碳乡村成为中国现代农业农村的鲜明底色。同时，深化生态保护补偿制度改革，推动生态产品价值实现，让农村生态优势变成产业效益和农民收入，走生产生活生态良性循环的农业强国之路。 同步推进农民农村共同富裕。实现全体人民共同富裕是中国式现代化的本质要求之一。当前，促进共同富裕最艰巨最繁重的任务依然在农村，加快建设农业强国必须把提高农民收入、促进农民农村共同富裕摆在突出位置。农业强国不仅意味着农业强，还要求农村美、农民富，因此，需要我们强化以工补农、以城带乡，推动形成工农互促、城乡互补、协调发展、共同繁荣的新型工农城乡关系，坚持农业农村优先发展，坚持城乡融合发展，畅通城乡要素流动，以此破解城乡发展不平衡、不充分的难题，实现城乡共同富裕。此外，与以资本逐利为主导的传统资本主义农业发展模式不同，具有中国特色的农业强国建设要求在现代农业发展过程中，着力推动城乡在要素配置、产业发展、安全标准、公共服务、生态保护等方面相互融合和协同发展，促进城乡生产要素平等交换、双向自由流动和公共资源合理配置，逐步缩小城乡发展差距和居民生活水平差距。 传承弘扬中华优秀传统农耕文化。农耕文化是中国乡村社会留存的独特文化，具有重大的传承发展价值。中国自古以农立国，农耕文化在漫长的传统农业经济社会里不断演变发展，深刻影响着中华民族的历史进程，时至今日仍渗透在中国乡村社会生活的方方面面。加快建设农业强国，要在乡风文明建设中弘扬中华优秀传统农耕文化，进一步挖掘传统农耕文化中蕴含的优秀成分，使其成为塑造新时代家风和新型农民精神世界的有益元素，为乡村全面振兴提供丰厚的精神文化滋养。 3.扎实推进农业强国建设 全方位夯实粮食安全根基，牢牢掌控“粮食安全”主动权。保障粮食和重要农产品稳定安全供给是建设农业强国的头等大事。党的二十大报告明确提出要“全方位夯实粮食安全根基”，进一步强调了粮食安全的重要性。保障粮食安全，首先，把关系14亿多人吃饭大事的耕地保护好，绝不能有闪失。要严防死守18亿亩耕地红线，采取长牙齿的硬措施，落实最严格的耕地保护制度。其次，着力改善农田设施条件，加强高标准农田建设。配套建设农田水利排灌、温室大棚等设施，提高水土资源利用效率。实施黑土地保护工程，加强农业面源污染治理，提升耕地质量。再次，坚持农业科技自立自强。从培育好种子做起，加强良种技术攻关，靠中国种子来保障中国粮食安全。最后，调动种粮和抓粮两个积极性。通过稳定和加强种粮补贴、完善农产品最低收购价政策、推进粮食作物保险试点以及落实粮食主产区利益补偿机制、产粮大县支持奖励等一系列政策措施，让农民种粮有钱赚，让主产区抓粮不吃亏。 全面深化改革，提高农业产业质量效益和竞争力。提高农业竞争力是建设农业强国的核心。加快建设农业强国必须适应新时代新要求，加快转变农业发展方式，加快农业技术创新步伐，走出一条集约、高效、安全、持续的现代农业发展道路。首先，在巩固完善农村基本经营制度基础上，进一步深化农村土地制度改革，保持承包关系稳定并长久不变，释放土地“三权分置”制度效应，发展多种形式适度规模经营。在此基础上，持续探索适合中国国情的现代农业经营体系，既坚持家庭生产的基础性地位、保护小农户利益，又积极培育新型农业经营主体，扶持壮大龙头企业，以联农带农实现强农富农。其次，将县域作为推动农业现代化的主阵地，在县域内推动人才、土地、资本等要素在城乡间双向流动和平等交换，实现城乡融合发展，激活农业发展的内在活力。最后，加快推动农业生产应用数字化技术，发展智慧型农业，强化科技创新全面赋能农业生产要素的能力，提高农业劳动生产率、土地产出率及生产工具智能化水平，大幅提升我国农业国际竞争力和产业领域核心技术掌控力。 坚持绿水青山就是金山银山，提升农业可持续发展能力。绿色发展是农业现代化的重要方式，也是建设农业强国的主要内容。建设农业强国，要重视对生态资源和环境的保护及有效利用，从制约农业绿色发展的重要领域和关键环节入手，探索重金属污染耕地治理、农业面源污染治理等有效支持政策，推进化肥农药减量增效、循环利用农业废弃物。加快调整农业产业结构，积极发展循环农业、生态畜禽养殖，培育绿色低碳农业产业链，强化农产品质量安全监管，增加绿色优质农产品供给，提升农业生态产品价值。积极开展农村生态环境保护修复，推动产业生态化与生态产业化融合发展，将农村生态资源转化成生态资产，将生态效益转化为经济效益和社会效益，让良好生态环境真正成为农村的最大优势和宝贵财富。 完善具有中国特色的现代农业支持保护政策。农业强国建设离不开政府对农业的支持保护，这也是世界各国推进农业现代化发展的共同选择。我国已经形成以保障粮食安全、促进农民增收为主要目标，由农民直接补贴、生产支持、价格支持等各类支出组成，涵盖农业产前、产中、产后各个环节的农业支持保护政策体系。当前，我国农业已步入由传统农业向现代农业跨越的关键时期，加快建设农业强国，要求进一步完善惠及农业农民的体制机制和政策体系，以政府行为为导向，坚持农业农村优先发展，引导社会资本投向农业农村农民；同时，创新体制机制，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，并充分发挥农民的主体作用，全面调动农民积极性、主动性和创造性，使政府、市场和农民协同互补形成发展合力，强化具有中国特色的多元化农业支持保护体系建设，为加快建设农业强国提供坚实保障。 作者：郑会霞、赵早（均系河南省中国特色社会主义理论体系研究中心研究员，分别系中共河南省委党校教授、副教授） 《光明日报》（2023年11月07日 06版）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109000431/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265206.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107114430/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265206.html,2023-11-09 0:00:00,Accelerating the Construction of a Strong Agricultural Country in the Process of Chinese-Style Modernization Source: Guangming Net - Guangming Daily Author: Zheng Huixia Zhao Zao Editor-in-Chief: Li Jiaqi 2023-11-07 17:05:11 0,"The report of the twentieth CPC National Congress clearly puts forward the need to accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, pointing out the direction and goals for the modernization of agriculture. China is a large traditional agricultural country with a long and heavy farming civilization and far-reaching influence; it is also a large country with agricultural resources and population, rich in ecological resources but relatively short of per capita resources. China's construction of a strong agricultural country can not simply copy the development model of foreign agricultural modernization, but according to the specific national conditions, focusing on the resource endowment of a large number of people and a small amount of land, the historical heritage of the farming civilization, and the requirements of the times of the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, scientific planning, gradual and orderly, according to the local conditions, and steadily and steadily, to explore the road of strong agriculture with Chinese characteristics in the process of Chinese-style modernization. 1. Accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country is an inevitable choice to promote Chinese-style modernization. A strong country must first strengthen agriculture, and a strong country can only be strong when agriculture is strong. Agriculture, which provides the most basic means of production and living for the development of human society, is the basis for our survival and development. Agricultural development is indispensable for meeting the people's needs for a better life, realizing high-quality development and strengthening the foundation of national security. For a long time before modern times, agriculture was the mother of civilization in both Eastern and Western countries. Even today, when the social division of labor and the progress of civilization have reached a high level, agriculture still plays the most basic supporting role, and its position is irreplaceable. A strong agricultural country is the foundation of a strong modern socialist country. Regardless of the degree of social modernization, a stable supply of food and important agricultural products for a population of more than 1.4 billion is always a top priority. The experience of China's socialist modernization shows that when agriculture flourishes, all industries flourish. Without the accumulation and support of agriculture, there will be no development of Chinese industry; without the modernization of agriculture, the modernization of the country will lose its foundation. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized that without a strong agricultural country, there will be no strong modernization as a whole; without agricultural and rural modernization, socialist modernization is incomplete. It is necessary to put accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country on the important position of building a strong socialist modernization country. The basic requirement for building a strong agricultural country is to realize agricultural modernization. In the process of promoting Chinese-style modernization, only when agriculture is strong and food security is fully guaranteed will we have sufficient confidence and strategic initiative to stabilize the overall situation, respond to changes and open up new horizons. Entering the new stage of development, in the face of the basic national conditions that China is still in and will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time, in the face of the history and reality that the dual structure of urban and rural areas has not been fundamentally changed, and that the trend of the growing gap between urban and rural areas has not been fundamentally reversed, as well as in the face of the status quo of China's agriculture, which is big, but not strong, and is rich, but not optimal in terms of development, the only way is to anchor ourselves in the goal of accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country, to maintain the strategic force, and to work hard for a long time to speed up the formulation of The only way to build a strong agricultural country is to anchor on the goal of accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country, maintain strategic strength, make long-term efforts, speed up the formulation of the plan for building a strong agricultural country, formulate roadmaps and construction charts for the goals of the next five years, 2035, and mid-century, strengthen the regulatory effect of the plan, and accelerate the mending of shortcomings in the development of agricultural modernization, so that we can provide strong protection for the opening of the new journey of comprehensively constructing a modern socialist country. At the same time, we also need to be soberly aware that building a strong agricultural country is a long-term and arduous historical task, and should be pushed forward in phases in a solid and steady manner, and persevere with the spirit of nailing down the work. At present, we should focus on comprehensively promoting the revitalization of the countryside, and do more to lay the foundation for long-term things. Each region should be based on resource endowment and development stage, give full play to its own advantages, serve the needs of the overall situation, start from the most urgent local agricultural and rural development, the farmers reflect the strongest practical problems, fully mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses of peasants, and vigorously promote the modernization of agriculture and rural areas, so that the face of agriculture and rural areas have been significantly improved, so that the living standards of farmers have increased significantly. 2. The basic requirements for the construction of a strong agricultural country A strong agricultural country is a dynamic and comparative concept. If a country's comprehensive agricultural production capacity, industrial competitiveness or the modernization level of agricultural advantageous sectors rank among the world's forefront and can lead the world's agricultural development, it can be called an agricultural powerhouse. China's transformation from a large agricultural country to an agricultural powerhouse should not only follow the general law of agricultural modernization, but also combine it with China's national agricultural conditions and adhere to its own basic requirements. Adhere to the Party's overall leadership of rural work. To build a strong agricultural country, we must adhere to the principle of the Party's leadership of the ""three rural areas"". The CPC scientifically draws a grand blueprint for Chinese-style modernization, grasps the strategic direction of modern agricultural development, and provides a strong guarantee for agricultural reform and development. Only by adhering to the Party's overall leadership of agricultural and rural work can it develop in the direction of socialist modernization. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has always attached great importance to strengthening the Party's leadership of agricultural and rural work, put the implementation of the strategy of rural revitalization in a priority position, continuously improved the leadership system of rural work under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the responsibility of the government, and the coordination and coordination of the Party committee's rural work departments, implemented the requirement that secretaries of the provinces, cities, counties, and villages at the five levels should grasp the revitalization of the countryside, and gradually perfected the Party's organizational system, institutional system, and working mechanism for leading the work in the countryside The Party's leadership in rural work has been gradually perfected in terms of organization, system and working mechanism. At present, to accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, we should further play a good role in the leading group of rural work at all levels of the Party Committee to take the lead in the overall coordination of the role of the village party organizations to further improve the village organization system led by the village party organizations, to cohesion of all parties, to form a concerted effort, to improve the Party's ability to comprehensively lead the work of the rural areas in the new era and improve its ability to take a stronger and more practical initiatives to promote the rapid development of agricultural modernization, and provide strong political guarantees for accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country. Provide strong political guarantee for the accelerated construction of a strong agricultural country. Adhere to the road of moderate-scale operation. China's national conditions of large number of people and small amount of land and decentralized contract farming determine that China's agricultural modernization is neither possible to achieve large-scale centralized operation through land transfer in a short period of time, nor is it possible to take the road of high input and high cost and small and complete facilities and equipment for households in some developed countries. To build a strong agricultural country, we must give full play to the advantages of the two-tier management system based on family contracting and the integration of unification and division, and take the road of moderate-scale operation. On the one hand, actively cultivate the development and growth of farmers' cooperatives, family farms and other types of new agricultural business subjects. On the other hand, the construction of new agricultural management main body and small farmers between the interests of the linkage mechanism, the modern factors of production effectively into small farmers production, to help small farmers to solve a family can not do, not good things. This moderate scale of operation, not only can effectively solve the small farmers production of low efficiency and effectiveness, weak docking ability with the market, science and technology promotion difficulties, and in line with China's per capita arable land is small, regional differences, uneven distribution of land resources and other realities, and effectively promote the organic convergence of small farmers and modern agriculture. Based on the harmonious coexistence of man and nature. The total amount of China's agro-ecological resources is large, but the per capita possession is low, and the resource constraints are obvious. Accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, we must resolutely abandon the endless demand for nature and even the destruction of nature's concept of development, and strive to avoid taking the ""first pollution, after the governance"" of the development of the old road, firmly establish and practice the concept of green mountains is the mountains of gold and silver, ecological priority, green development as the guide, and unswervingly take the modernization of man and nature in harmony with the development of the road. The road of development. Standing at the height of the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, we plan the road of green development in agriculture and rural areas, guard the green water and green mountains, and make eco-agriculture, green agriculture, and low-carbon countryside the distinctive undertones of China's modern agriculture and rural areas. At the same time, deepen the reform of the ecological protection compensation system, promote the realization of the value of ecological products, so that the ecological advantages of rural areas can be transformed into industrial benefits and farmers' income, and take the road of a strong agricultural country with a benign cycle of production, life and ecology. Simultaneously promote the common prosperity of farmers and rural areas. Achieving common prosperity for all people is one of the essential requirements of Chinese-style modernization. At present, the most arduous and burdensome task of promoting common prosperity is still in the countryside, and accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country must place the improvement of farmers' incomes and the promotion of the common prosperity of farmers and rural areas in a prominent position. A strong agricultural country not only means strong agriculture, but also requires the beauty of the countryside and the prosperity of farmers. Therefore, we need to strengthen our efforts to supplement agriculture with industry and bring the countryside to the city, promote the formation of a new type of industrial-agricultural-rural relationship in which industry and agriculture are mutually reinforcing, urban and rural areas complement each other, and develop in a coordinated manner for the common prosperity of the countryside and the countryside, insist on giving priority to the development of agriculture and the countryside, adhere to the integration of urban and rural areas, and unimpeded flow of urban and rural factors, so as to solve the difficult problem of the imbalance and inadequacy of the development of the city and the countryside and realize the Common prosperity. In addition, unlike the traditional capitalist model of agricultural development, which is dominated by capital driven by profit, the construction of a strong agricultural country with Chinese characteristics requires that, in the process of modern agricultural development, efforts be made to promote the mutual integration and synergistic development of urban and rural areas in terms of factor allocation, industrial development, safety standards, public services, ecological protection, etc., and that the equal exchange of urban and rural factors of production, the two-way free flow of production factors and the rational allocation of public resources be promoted, so that the gap between urban and rural development and the level of living of the population will gradually be narrowed. Promote equal exchange of production factors between urban and rural areas, two-way free flow of production factors and rational allocation of public resources, and gradually narrow the gap between urban and rural areas in terms of development and living standards. Inheriting and carrying forward China's outstanding traditional farming culture. Farming culture is a unique culture that has survived in China's rural societies, and is of great value for inheritance and development. Since ancient times, China has been founded on agriculture, and the farming culture has evolved and developed in the long traditional agricultural economy and society, profoundly influencing the historical process of the Chinese nation, and still permeating every aspect of social life in rural China today. To accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, it is necessary to carry forward China's excellent traditional farming culture in the construction of rural civilization, and further explore the excellent components contained in traditional farming culture, so as to make it become a useful element in shaping the spiritual world of the new era of family customs and new farmers, and to provide rich spiritual and cultural nourishment for the comprehensive revitalization of the countryside. 3. Solidly promote the construction of a strong agricultural country Strengthen the foundation of food security on all fronts, and firmly control the initiative of ""food security"". Guaranteeing a stable and safe supply of food and important agricultural products is a top priority in building a strong agricultural country. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress clearly puts forward the need to ""strengthen the foundation of food security on all fronts"", further emphasizing the importance of food security. To ensure food security, first of all, the relationship between more than 1.4 billion people to eat arable land is well protected, there must be no failure. The red line of 1.8 billion mu of arable land should be strictly guarded, and the most stringent arable land protection system should be implemented by adopting hard measures with long teeth. Secondly, efforts to improve the conditions of farmland facilities, strengthen the construction of high-standard farmland. Supporting the construction of farmland water conservancy, drainage and irrigation, greenhouses and other facilities to improve the efficiency of water and soil resources. The implementation of black land protection project, strengthen the management of agricultural surface pollution, improve the quality of arable land. Again, adhere to the agricultural science and technology self-reliance. Starting from cultivating good seeds, strengthening the technology of good seeds, and relying on Chinese seeds to guarantee China's food security. Finally, mobilize the enthusiasm of both grain growing and grain catching. By stabilizing and strengthening subsidies for grain planting, improving the minimum purchase price policy for agricultural products, promoting the pilot scheme of grain crop insurance, and implementing a series of policy measures such as the compensation mechanism for the benefits of the main grain-producing areas and the support and reward for the big grain-producing counties, we will allow farmers to make money by planting grains, and the main grain-producing areas to grasp grains without suffering any losses. Comprehensively deepen the reform to improve the quality, efficiency and competitiveness of the agricultural industry. Improving agricultural competitiveness is the core of building a strong agricultural country. Accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country must adapt to the new requirements of the new era, accelerate the transformation of the mode of agricultural development, accelerate the pace of agricultural technological innovation, and walk out of an intensive, highly efficient, safe, and sustainable road of modern agricultural development. First, on the basis of consolidating and perfecting the basic management system in rural areas, we should further deepen the reform of the rural land system, keep the contractual relationship stable and unchanged for a long time, release the effect of the system of ""three rights of ownership"" of land, and develop various forms of moderate-scale operation. On this basis, we will continue to explore a modern agricultural management system that suits China's national conditions, not only insisting on the fundamental position of family production and protecting the interests of small farmers, but also actively fostering new agricultural management main bodies, supporting and expanding leading enterprises, and realizing the strengthening of agriculture and enrichment of agriculture by linking agriculture and bringing agriculture together. Second, the county as the main position to promote agricultural modernization, within the county to promote talent, land, capital and other factors in the urban and rural two-way flow and equal exchange, to achieve urban and rural integration and development, to activate the intrinsic vitality of agricultural development. Finally, accelerate the application of digital technology in agricultural production, develop intelligent agriculture, strengthen the ability of scientific and technological innovation to comprehensively empower the factors of agricultural production, improve the productivity of agricultural labor, land output rate and the level of intelligent production tools, and significantly enhance the international competitiveness of China's agriculture and the control of core technologies in the industrial field. Adhere to the principle that green water and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains, and enhance the ability of sustainable development of agriculture. Green development is an important way of agricultural modernization and a major component of building an agricultural powerhouse. To build a strong agricultural country, it is necessary to pay attention to the protection and effective use of ecological resources and the environment, start from the important areas and key links that constrain the green development of agriculture, explore the treatment of heavy metal-polluted arable land, the treatment of agricultural surface pollution, and other effective support policies, and promote the reduction of fertilizers and pesticides to increase the efficiency of recycling of agricultural wastes. Accelerate the adjustment of agricultural industrial structure, actively develop recycling agriculture, ecological livestock and poultry breeding, cultivate green low-carbon agricultural industry chain, strengthen the quality and safety supervision of agricultural products, increase the supply of green and high-quality agricultural products, and enhance the value of agro-ecological products. It has actively carried out restoration of rural ecological environment protection, promoted the integration of industrial ecology and ecological industrialization, transformed rural ecological resources into ecological assets, and transformed ecological benefits into economic and social benefits, so that a good ecological environment can truly become the greatest advantage and valuable wealth of the countryside. Improve modern agricultural support and protection policies with Chinese characteristics. The construction of a strong agricultural country cannot be separated from the government's support and protection of agriculture, which is also the common choice of countries around the world to promote the modernization and development of agriculture. China has formed a system of agricultural support and protection policies with the main goal of guaranteeing food security and promoting farmers' income growth, consisting of various types of expenditures such as direct subsidies for farmers, production support and price support, and covering all aspects of pre-production, production and post-production in agriculture. At present, China's agriculture has stepped into a critical period from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture, accelerate the construction of a strong agricultural country, requires further improvement of the institutional mechanism and policy system benefiting agriculture and farmers, government behavior-oriented, adhere to the priority development of agriculture and rural areas, and guide the investment of social capital in agriculture, rural areas and farmers; at the same time, the innovative institutional mechanism, so that the market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources, and to give better play to the role of the government At the same time, innovate institutions and mechanisms to make the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, give better play to the role of the government, and give full play to the main role of farmers, comprehensively mobilize farmers' enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, so as to make the government, the market and the farmers synergize and complement each other to form a synergy of development, strengthen the construction of a diversified agricultural support and protection system with Chinese characteristics, and provide solid guarantees for accelerating the construction of a strong agricultural country.

走向成功的必经之路——认准方向，持续努力 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：周燕虎   张成名 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-07 06:47:32 0,“永远相信持续努力的力量” ■ 周燕虎   张成名 ●成功从来不会从天而降、一蹴而就，更不会轻易降临在等待和懒散之中。只有认准方向、走好脚下的路，坚持不懈挥洒汗水，才能创造不平凡的人生 10月26日，神舟十七号载人飞船顺利发射，航天员汤洪波重返“天宫”。这一次，汤洪波作为指令长，要进入的是有着三舱构型的中国空间站，任务更加艰巨复杂。然而，危险和困难从来不是他前行的阻碍。在他看来，“如果你一直都是迎难而上，不断去挑战自己的极限，挑战自己能力圈的边界，自己会越来越优秀，越来越不一样，其实跟做难事必有所得是一样的，永远相信持续努力的力量。”正因为锚定目标持续努力，汤洪波不断战胜困难、突破极限，成为目前为止执行两次飞天任务间隔时间最短的中国航天员。 成功从来不会从天而降、一蹴而就，更不会轻易降临在等待和懒散之中。只有认准方向、走好脚下的路，坚持不懈挥洒汗水，才能创造不平凡的人生。聂海胜时刻准备为祖国出征太空，始终心无旁骛、刻苦训练，这才有了三度飞天的壮举；南仁东20多年专注于技术攻关，通过不懈努力，闯过重重难关，最终率团队打造出世界最大、最灵敏的单口径射电望远镜。由此可见，持续努力是为了更好蓄力，其间所有流过的汗水、战胜的伤痛、经历的低谷，经过岁月的磨砺与沉淀，都会化作人生路上的厚积薄发，成为登攀事业高峰的强大力量。 持续努力，难的是“坚持到底”。伏尔泰说：“要在这个世界上获得成功，就必须坚持到底。”从古至今，但凡事业有成者，无一不是用持之以恒的力量去战胜自己、战胜时间、战胜困难。相比之下，现实中一些人之所以成绩平平，不是因为没有坚持过，而是缺乏坚持到底的意志和韧劲。有的遭遇挫折失败，就心灰意冷、不战而退；有的取得一点成绩，就骄傲自满、止步不前。如此行为，绝难行稳致远。只有坚守人生理想，无论成败得失都一如既往地奋力向前奔跑，不因一时之失而停下奋斗的脚步，不因一事之功而丧失前行的动力，精进不止、忘我投入，方能用持续努力敲开成功之门。 持续努力，关键在“脚踏实地”。成功从不青睐好高骛远的空想家，也不欣赏浮而不实的空谈者，而只属于脚踏实地、埋头苦干的实干家。“加班的地方有我，干活最忙的地方有我，最苦的地方也有我。”回想从放羊娃到全国技术能手的圆梦之旅，90后全国人大代表师延财说，苦练焊接技术时的汗水，换来了现在的甘甜。“最美新时代革命军人”成林每一次训练都全力以赴、严抓细抠，每一个动作都悉心揣摩、精益求精，练就了克敌制胜的过硬本领，28次参加比武竞赛，23次摘金夺银。从中不难看出，不论处于什么岗位，从事什么工作，担负什么职责，都要保持踏实干事的品质和作风，全心投入，倾力付出，力求把每一件细小事情都做到精致，把每一项平凡工作都干到极致，就会有所收获、有所成就。 应当看到，需要我们持续努力的，绝非触手可及的平常小事，必然是充满挑战、充满艰辛的苦事难事。辩证地看，攻坚克难固然需要付出很多辛苦，甚至会面临巨大牺牲，但迎难而上之时总能激发我们的无限潜力，让我们在尝尽百般苦后强筋壮骨、增长才干。黄旭华“人间蒸发”30年埋头造潜艇，林俊德生命不息奋斗不止为国家铸核盾……这些英雄模范不畏难事、甘做难事，无惧无畏向最难处奋力攻坚，干出了一番新事业、闯出了一片新天地。人生路上，勇于担苦，才能功不唐捐、滴水穿石；勇于担难，才能艰难困苦、玉汝于成；勇于担重，才能知重负重、勇毅前行；勇于担险，才能临危受命、不负众望。这是持续努力的应有之义，也是走向成功的必经之路。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109000431/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265171.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107152701/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265171.html,2023-11-09 0:00:00,The Road to Success - Recognize the Direction and Make Continuous Efforts Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Zhou Yanhu Zhang Chengming Editor-in-Chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-07 06:47:32 0,"""Always believe in the power of continuous effort"" ■ Zhou Yanhu Zhang Chenming ● Success will never fall from the sky, overnight, and will not easily come in the waiting and laziness. Only by recognizing the direction, walking well underfoot, and persistently sweating, can we create an extraordinary life On October 26, Shenzhou 17 manned spacecraft was launched successfully, and astronaut Tang Hongbo returned to the ""Heavenly Palace"". This time, Tang Hongbo as the commander, to enter the Chinese space station with a three-compartment configuration, the task is more difficult and complex. However, dangers and difficulties have never been an obstacle to his progress. In his opinion, ""If you always rise to the challenge, constantly to challenge their own limits, challenge the boundaries of their own circle of competence, they will become more and more excellent, more and more different, in fact, with doing difficult things will be gained is the same, always believe in the power of sustained efforts."" Because of the anchored goals and continuous efforts, Tang Hongbo constantly overcame the difficulties and broke through the limits, and became the Chinese astronaut with the shortest interval between two flying missions so far. Success never falls from the sky and is achieved overnight, nor does it come easily through waiting and laziness. Only by recognizing the direction, walking well on the road underfoot, and persevering and sweating can we create an extraordinary life. Nie Haisheng is always ready to go into space for the motherland, always without distractions, hard training, which led to the feat of flying three times; Nan Rendong more than 20 years focused on technical research, through unremitting efforts, through the difficulties, and ultimately led the team to create the world's largest and most sensitive single-caliber radio telescope. It can be seen that sustained efforts are for better power, during which all the sweat, overcome the pain, experienced the trough, after years of sharpening and precipitation, will be turned into a life on the road to the thick and thin, and become a climb to the peak of the cause of a powerful force. Continuous efforts, the difficult thing is to ""stick to the end"". Voltaire said: ""To be successful in this world, we must stick to the end."" From ancient times to the present, but all successful people, all are not with the power of perseverance to overcome themselves, to overcome time, to overcome the difficulties. In contrast, the reality is that the reason why some people have mediocre results, not because there is no persistence, but the lack of perseverance to the end of the will and tenacity. Some suffered setbacks and failures, on the disheartened, retreat without a fight; some have made a little achievement, on the complacency, stop. Such behavior, it is absolutely difficult to go steady and far. Only adhere to the ideals of life, regardless of success or failure to run forward as always, not because of the loss of a moment to stop the struggle, not because of the success of the loss of the power to move forward, more than just refinement, selflessness, can be a sustained effort to knock open the door to success. Continuous efforts, the key in the ""down-to-earth"". Success never favors over-ambitious visionaries, and do not appreciate the floating but not real talkers, but only belongs to the down-to-earth, hard-working doers. ""Overtime where there is me, work the busiest place there is me, the most bitter place there is me."" Thinking back from the sheep herder to the national technical master of the dream journey, 90 NPC deputies Shi Yanzai said that the sweat when practicing hard welding technology, in exchange for the sweetness of the present. ""The most beautiful new era of revolutionary soldiers"" Cheng Lin every training are fully committed, strict grasp of the fine key, every action are careful to figure out, strive for excellence, practiced to overcome the enemy to win the hard skills, 28 times to participate in martial arts competitions, 23 times to win gold and silver. It is not difficult to see that, regardless of what position, engaged in what work, what responsibilities, we must maintain the quality and style of practical officers, fully committed, dedicated to pay, and strive to do every little thing to do exquisite, every ordinary work to the extreme, will have gained some success, some achievements. Should see, we need to continue to work hard, never within reach of the ordinary small things, is bound to be full of challenges, full of painstaking hard things. Looked at dialectically, certainly need to pay a lot of hard work to overcome the difficulties, and even face huge sacrifices, but when we meet the difficulties can always stimulate our unlimited potential, so that we have tasted a hundred bitter after the strength, growth and competence. Huang Xuhua ""evaporated"" 30 years buried submarine, Lin Junde life and struggle for the country to cast a nuclear shield more than ...... these heroes and models are not afraid of the difficult things, willing to do difficult things, fearless and fearless to the most difficult place to attack, do a new career, broke out of a new world. The new world. On the road of life, the courage to bear the pain, in order to not donations, water penetrates the stone; the courage to bear the difficulty, in order to be difficult and difficult, the Jade Ruyi; the courage to bear the weight, in order to know the weight of the burden, the courage to move forward; the courage to bear the risk, in order to accept the orders in danger, not to live up to the expectations. This is the rightful meaning of sustained efforts, but also the road to success.","The article highlights the importance of continuous effort in achieving success.

知行论坛丨锚定目标真抓实干务求实效 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：姜凯峰 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-07 06:44:05 0,锚定目标真抓实干务求实效 ——“让主题教育在基层见行见效”系列谈之十 ■姜凯峰 插图：周　洁 ●着眼主题教育明确的目标任务，拿出实实在在的举措和行动，把工作抓实、基础打实、步子迈实，真正用实干推动发展、以实绩取信于官兵 为学之实，固在践履。在学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育工作会议上，习主席要求广大党员、干部“胸怀‘国之大者’，紧紧围绕新时代新征程党的中心任务，真抓实干、务求实效”，彰显了践行“三个务必”的历史主动，体现了主题教育目标导向、实践导向与结果导向的有机统一。当前，第二批主题教育已全面推开。广大基层党员作为具体组织者、参与者，必须坚持干字当头、向实用力，以“时时放心不下”的责任感、积极担当作为的精气神履好职、尽好责，用部队建设高质量发展的实际成效检验主题教育成果。 目标引领方向，凝聚力量。在奋斗的道路上，基于对形势任务的深刻分析判断，提出符合自身实际的奋斗目标，就会生发出为实现目标而努力奋斗的不竭动力，从而坚定扛起肩负的使命责任，踔厉奋发、勇毅前行。历史和现实充分证明，只要我们锚定奋斗目标，埋头苦干、攻坚克难，一任接着一任干，一张蓝图绘到底，就一定能创造无愧于党、无愧于人民、无愧于时代的业绩。同第一批主题教育相比，第二批主题教育更具广泛性，在目标要求上更有针对性，需要解决的矛盾问题也更复杂、更具体，尤其需要把实的要求贯穿全过程，把学习成效转化为做好本职工作的生动实践，着眼主题教育明确的目标任务，拿出实实在在的举措和行动，把工作抓实、基础打实、步子迈实，真正用实干推动发展、以实绩取信于官兵。 实干精神是我们党的优良传统和宝贵财富，也是对党员干部和革命军人一以贯之的政治要求。从老一辈科技工作者勇闯技术“无人区”成功研制出“两弹一星”，到党员干部大胆突破带领群众“杀出一条血路来”；从无数共产党人协力奋斗完成脱贫攻坚，到广大官兵奋战在救灾一线守护人民生命财产安全……一个个闪光足迹，无不彰显着苦干实干、顽强拼搏的作风。习主席指出：“我们党百年奋斗的伟大成就都是党团结带领全国各族人民拼出来、干出来的，要把党的二十大描绘的宏伟蓝图变成现实，仍然要靠拼、要靠干。”辩证唯物主义认为，全部社会生活在本质上是实践的。对军队基层党员干部而言，推动主题教育在基层落地生根，关键就是聚焦如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标，坚决落实“重实践”要求，坚持学思用贯通、知信行统一，匡正干的导向，增强干的动力，形成干的合力，在以学促干上取得实实在在的成效。 有什么样的精神状态，就有什么样的工作成效。现实中，有的党员干部干事创业精气神不足，或拈轻怕重、逃避责任，习惯于拿“按规定办、等上级定”作“挡箭牌”，碰到矛盾和难题绕道走，不敢动真碰硬；或敷衍塞责、得过且过，为了不出事宁愿不干事，工作动力不足、标准不高，往往被上级催着干、被问题逼着干、被任务拽着干。这些现象不除，何谈真抓实干？“水不激不跃，人不激不奋。”党员干部实干担当，必须端正政绩观、强化使命感，以无为难寐的心态、只争朝夕的状态、奋发有为的姿态，积极投身国防和军队建设。在工作中，要力戒形式主义、官僚主义，坚持一切从实际出发，不搞华而不实的东西，不做表面文章，多做打基础、利长远的工作，把全部心思和精力放在干实事、谋实招、求实效上，不断激发奋斗强军、岗位建功的内生动力。 问题是时代的声音、工作的导向。当前，国防和军队建设进入滚石上山、爬坡过坎的关键期，无论是加快转型建设，还是加强练兵备战，无论是推进改革创新，还是加强基层治理，都面临许多矛盾困难和现实问题。越是情况复杂、矛盾棘手，越能考验斗争精神、折射党性修养，越需要知难而进、迎难而上。“最美新时代革命军人”陈刚果调任湖北恩施军分区某处处长后，深入调查研究，根据矛盾症结多方协调，有效解决了当地征兵工作“老大难”问题。让主题教育在基层见行见效，应坚持问题导向不动摇，扑下身子、沉到一线，不断获取第一手资料，把情况摸清、把问题找准、把对策提实。基层实践中，既需要强化知重负重、担当作为的精神，勇于担苦、担难、担重、担险，坚决啃下硬骨头、打好攻坚战；又需要运用科学的思想方法和工作方法，做到解决老问题有新思路、解决新问题有新办法，具体问题具体分析，在创造性解决问题中推动工作有效落实。 “苏区干部好作风，自带干粮去办公；日着草鞋干革命，夜打灯笼访贫农。”一首群众自编的山歌，是当年苏区干部艰苦奋斗、为民干事的真实写照。1958年，昆明军区13军37师政委何云峰、副师长张化民身着士兵服、佩戴列兵衔，到基层摸爬滚打两个多月，摸清了基层的实际情况，改进了领导方法，指导了全师工作。主题教育抓得实不实，官兵最有发言权。参加第二批主题教育的单位和人员，同基层联系直接，更应传承“苏区干部好作风”，发扬“当兵蹲连”好传统，把精力向基层再聚焦、资源向基层再下沉、服务向基层再倾斜。要围绕官兵急难愁盼问题，严格落实为基层办实事制度和党员领导干部直接联系群众制度，健全解难帮困常态机制，对官兵关心关切的敏感问题及时解疑释惑、回应诉求，对涉及部队建设的重大问题做到亲自指导、靠前指挥，以钉钉子精神抓落实，引领崇尚实干在基层蔚然成风，不断开创事业发展新局面。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109000431/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265170.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107235256/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265170.html,2023-11-09 0:00:00,Knowing and Doing Forum丨anchor the goal and work hard for practical results Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Jiang Kaifeng Editor in Chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-07 06:44:05 0,"The goal is to anchor the real work and seek practical results - ""let the theme of education at the grass-roots level to see the effect of the"" series of ten ■ Jiang Kaifeng Illustration: Zhou Jie ● focusing on the theme of education and the clear objectives and tasks, come up with practical initiatives and actions, to grasp the work of a solid, solid foundation, The first step is to make sure that you have a solid foundation and a solid step, so that you can really promote development with solid work and win the trust of the officers and soldiers with solid achievements. In the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of the theme of education work conference, President Xi asked the majority of party members, cadres ""bosom"" of the country, closely around the new era of the new journey of the party's central task, and really grasp the practical work, and seek practical results"", highlighting the practice of the socialist thought of the new era of Xi Jinping. It shows the historical initiative of practicing the ""three musts"", and embodies the organic unity of goal-oriented, practice-oriented and result-oriented theme education. At present, the second batch of theme education has been fully launched. The majority of grass-roots party members as a specific organizer, participants, must adhere to the word dry, to the practical force, with ""when assured of the"" sense of responsibility, actively take on the role of the spirit to perform their duties, do their duty, with the construction of high-quality development of the troops to test the results of the theme of the results of education. The goal leads the direction, cohesion. On the road of struggle, based on a profound analysis and judgment of the situation and task, put forward in line with the actual goal of their own struggle, will be born to achieve the goal and strive for the inexhaustible power, so as to firmly shoulder the responsibility of the mission, to excel, the courage to go forward. History and reality have fully proved that, as long as we anchor the goal of the struggle, bury our heads in the sand, overcome the difficulties, one term after another to do, a blueprint to the end, we will be able to create a worthy of the party, worthy of the people, worthy of the times of the performance. Compared with the first batch of thematic education, the second batch of thematic education is more extensive, more targeted in the target requirements, the need to solve the contradictions and problems are more complex, more specific, especially the need to put the requirements of the real throughout the entire process, the effectiveness of learning into a good job lively practice, focusing on the theme of the theme of the education of the target task, come up with practical initiatives and actions, to grasp the work of the real, the foundation of the real, the pace of the real, really with the real work to promote the work, the real, the real, the real and the real. Take a solid step, really use the practical work to promote the development of the real performance to win the trust of the officers and soldiers. Do-it-yourself spirit is our party's fine tradition and valuable wealth, but also to the party cadres and revolutionary soldiers consistent political requirements. From the old generation of science and technology workers to venture into the technical ""no man's land"" successfully developed ""two bombs and one star"", to the party cadres bold breakthroughs to lead the masses ""to kill a bloody road to""; from countless From countless communists struggling to complete the fight against poverty, to the majority of officers and soldiers fighting on the front line of disaster relief to protect people's lives and property safety ...... a flash of footprints, all highlighting the style of hard work, tenacity and hard work. President Xi pointed out that ""the great achievements of our party's century-long struggle are the party united to lead the people of all ethnic groups to spell out, dry out, to the party's twentieth grand blueprint depicted into a reality, still rely on the spell, rely on dry."" Dialectical materialism believes that all social life is essentially practical. For the grass-roots party members and cadres of the army, the key to promoting thematic education at the grass-roots level is to focus on the realization of the goal of 100 years of the army, resolutely implement the requirements of ""heavy practice"", adhere to the learning of thought and use of coherent, unity of knowledge and beliefs and behavior, and to rectify the direction of dryness, enhance the impetus of dryness, and form a synergy of dryness, and to achieve concrete results in the study of the dryness. The results. What kind of state of mind, there is what kind of work results. In reality, some party members and cadres are not enough spirit of entrepreneurship, or light, to avoid responsibility, used to take ""according to the regulations, such as the higher level,"" as a ""shield"", encountered contradictions and problems detour, do not dare to take a hard line; or perfunctory, to get by, in order to not get into trouble would rather not do things, the work is not a good idea. In order not to get into trouble rather than officers, lack of motivation, low standards, often pushed by superiors to do, was forced to do the problem, was the task dragged to do. These phenomena are not removed, how can we talk about real work? ""Water does not stimulate not leap, people do not stimulate not excited."" Party members and cadres to do to bear, must correct the concept of performance, strengthen the sense of mission, with no for hard to sleep mentality, only to fight for the state of the night, the posture of the active participation in the national defense and military construction. In the work, we must guard against formalism, bureaucracy, adhere to all from a practical point of view, do not engage in flashy things, do not do superficial articles, do more to lay the foundation for long-term work, put all the heart and energy on doing practical things, make practical moves, seek practical results, and constantly stimulate the struggle for a strong army, the post of the endogenous momentum of the work. Problems are the voice of the times, work-oriented. At present, the national defense and military construction into the rolling stone, climbing over the critical period, whether it is to accelerate the transformation of the construction, or to strengthen the training and preparation for war, whether it is to promote reform and innovation, or to strengthen grass-roots governance, are faced with a lot of contradictions and difficulties and real problems. The more complex the situation, the more difficult the contradictions, the more can test the spirit of struggle, refractive cultivation of party spirit, the more need to know the difficulties and rise to the occasion. ""The most beautiful revolutionary soldier of the new era"" Chen Congo transferred to Enshi military division in Hubei, a division director, in-depth investigation and research, according to the contradictions of the knot coordination, and effectively solve the local conscription work ""difficult"" problem. Let the theme of education at the grass-roots level to see the results, should adhere to the problem-oriented unswervingly, down to the body, sink to the front line, and constantly access to first-hand information, the situation to find out, to find the right problem, the countermeasures to mention the real. Grassroots practice, both the need to strengthen the knowledge of the heavy burden, take on the role of the spirit, the courage to bear the pain, bear the difficulty, bear the weight, bear the risk, determined to gnaw down the hard bones, fight a good battle; but also need to use scientific methods of thought and methods of work, so that to solve the old problems with new ideas, new solutions to solve new problems with new approaches, specific problems and specific analyses, in the creative problem solving to promote the effective implementation of the work. ""The Soviet cadres have a good style, bring their own dry food to the office; day with straw shoes to do the revolution, night lanterns to visit the poor peasants."" A mass of self-produced song, is the Soviet cadres hard work, for the people of the true portrayal of the officer. 1958, Kunming Military Region 13 army 37 division political commissar He Yunfeng, deputy division commander Zhang Huamin dressed in soldier's clothes, wearing a soldier's title, to the grassroots level more than two months, to understand the actual situation at the grassroots level, to improve the leadership method, guided the work of the whole division. Theme education to grasp the real or not, officers and soldiers have the most right to speak. Participate in the second batch of thematic education units and personnel, with direct contact with the grassroots, should be inherited ""Soviet cadres good style"", carry forward the ""soldier squatting company"" good tradition, the energy to the grass-roots level to focus, resources to the grass-roots level to sink, service to the grass-roots level tilt again. To focus on the urgent problems of the soldiers, strictly implement the system of practical work for the grassroots and the system of direct contact with the masses by leading cadres of the party, and improve the regular mechanism for solving problems and helping them, and to solve the doubts and respond to the demands of the officers and soldiers of the sensitive issues of concern in a timely manner, to do the construction of the major issues related to the troops to personally guide the command, and to grasp the implementation of the spirit of nails to lead the respect of practical work at the grass-roots level has become a trend, and to continuously create new situations of development of the cause. The development of a new situation.","The article discusses the importance of anchoring the goal and focusing on practical results in the ""Knowing and Doing"" Forum. It emphasizes the need for practical initiatives and actions to ensure that work is solid and that achievements can win the trust of the officers and soldiers. It also highlights the necessity of using a problem-oriented approach in the second batch of theme education in order to solve contradictions and difficulties effectively. It encourages party members and cadres to have a spirit of entrepreneurship, dedication, and focus on practical work to achieve concrete results.

【理论圆桌会】把握“第二个结合”的重大意义 来源：人民网-理论频道 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-11 15:42:45 0,集理论之思，汇大家之言。《理论圆桌会》栏目，紧跟理论热点，关注理论动态。 本期主题：习近平总书记近日在文化传承发展座谈会上对“两个结合”作了进一步论述，突出强调了“第二个结合”的重大意义。如何把握“第二个结合”的重大意义？理论圆桌会集纳专家学者的相关文章，与大家一起学习。 “第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放 北京市习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心特约研究员、北京师范大学中共党史党建研究院院长王炳林认为，从思想解放的高度阐释“第二个结合”的伟大意义，表明我们党对马克思主义指导作用机理的认识有了新飞跃，对中华优秀传统文化现代化的认识有了新视野，对马克思主义和中华优秀传统文化契合性的认识达到新高度。 马克思主义科学揭示了人类社会发展规律，指明了人类解放的道路，推进了人类文明进程，但“马克思的整个世界观不是教义，而是方法。它提供的不是现成的教条，而是进一步研究的出发点和供这种研究使用的方法”。马克思主义的生机和活力在于同各个国家、民族的具体实际相结合。 在马克思主义的指导下，中华优秀传统文化再次获得了跃动不息的生命力，转化为新时代以文化人的无穷力量，也建立起由古至今、一脉相承的中华文化传统。 我们历来强调马克思主义的指导作用，也强调要继承弘扬中华优秀传统文化。但是过去对于两者之间的契合性、相容性关注不够，甚至出现过以一种思想取代或压抑另一种思想的倾向。实际上，马克思主义传入中国后，科学社会主义的主张受到中国人民热烈欢迎，并最终扎根中国大地、开花结果，绝不是偶然的，而在于其同我国传承了几千年的优秀历史文化和广大人民日用而不觉的价值观念是相融通的。 让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的 人民日报刊发文章指出，我们要深刻认识和把握“第二个结合”的重大意义，更好推进“第二个结合”，让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的。 中国特色社会主义植根于中华文化沃土、反映中国人民意愿、适合中国和时代发展进步要求，有着深厚历史渊源和广泛现实基础。中国特色社会主义道路是在马克思主义指导下走出来的，也是从五千多年中华文明史中走出来的。只有立足博大精深的中华优秀传统文化，才能真正理解和把握中国道路、理论、制度的历史必然、文化底蕴与独特优势。 “第二个结合”反映了新时代中国共产党人的历史自信和历史主动，彰显了新时代中国共产党人的文化自信和文化担当。推进“第二个结合”，能让我们更深刻把握中华优秀传统文化的历史渊源、发展脉络、基本走向，深刻理解中华文化的独特创造、价值理念、鲜明特色，深入挖掘和阐发其中蕴含的思想精华、道德精髓、时代价值，着力展示中华民族的独特精神标识，更好构筑中国精神、中国价值、中国力量。 中华文明具有突出的创新性，从根本上决定了中华民族守正不守旧、尊古不复古的进取精神，决定了中华民族不惧新挑战、勇于接受新事物的无畏品格。我们党在推进“第二个结合”的历史进程中，用马克思主义激活中华优秀传统文化中富有生命力的优秀因子并赋予新的时代内涵，将中华民族的伟大精神和丰富智慧更深层次地注入马克思主义，让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的。 我们党在传承中华优秀传统文化中推进文化创新的自觉性达到了新高度 广东省习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心特约研究员周峰和钮则圳联合发表文章指出，深刻理解习近平总书记对“第二个结合”的重要论述，是我们在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明的根本遵循。 “第二个结合”，是我们党对马克思主义中国化时代化历史经验的深刻总结，是对中华文明发展规律的深刻把握，表明我们党对中国特色社会主义道路、理论、制度的认识达到了新高度，表明我们党的历史自信、文化自信达到了新高度，表明我们党在传承中华优秀传统文化中推进文化创新的自觉性达到了新高度。“周虽旧邦，其命维新。”在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明，我们要坚持不忘本来、吸收外来、面向未来，坚持守正创新，坚定文化自信自强，扎实推进中华民族现代文明和社会主义文化强国建设，谱写中华文明新的时代华章。 蕴含着深刻的理论逻辑、价值逻辑和实践逻辑 陕西科技大学马克思主义学院院长、教授，陕西省中国特色社会主义理论体系研究中心研究员吴明永撰文表示，习近平总书记关于“第二个结合”的重大论断，蕴含着深刻的理论逻辑、价值逻辑和实践逻辑。 从理论逻辑来看，“第二个结合”是对马克思主义中国化在机理上的深度诠释。“第二个结合”这一论断的具体表述中已经清楚地指出了要结合的对象，即“马克思主义基本原理”和“中华优秀传统文化”。这二者之所以能够结合，是因为它们本身具有高度的契合性。 从价值逻辑来看，“第二个结合”是对马克思主义中国化时代化诉求的深沉关切。不断推进“第二个结合”，对中国的经济社会发展、对推进中华民族伟大复兴，有着至关重要的价值和意义。 从实践逻辑来看，“第二个结合”为推进中国式现代化注入精神力量。“马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合”是一个理论命题，更是一项实践课题。“第二个结合”的提出，为中华优秀传统文化的保护、传承和发展，以及与马克思主义的融合指明了道路。 （来源：人民日报、光明日报）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231112000347/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266086.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111084937/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266086.html,2023-11-12 0:00:00,"[Theory Roundtable] Grasp the significance of the ""second combination"" Source: People's Daily Online - Theory Channel Responsibility: Li Jiaqi 2023-11-11 15:42:45 0","Collecting theoretical thoughts, converging everyone's words. The Theory Roundtable column keeps abreast of the theoretical hotspots and pays attention to the theoretical dynamics. The theme of this issue: General Secretary Xi Jinping recently further discussed the ""two combinations"" at the Symposium on Cultural Heritage Development, highlighting the significance of the ""second combination"". How to grasp the significance of the ""second combination""? The Theory Roundtable will summarize the relevant articles of experts and scholars, and study them together with you. ""The second combination is another ideological liberation According to Wang Binglin, a special researcher at the Research Center for Xi Jinping Ideology of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in Beijing, and the director of the Institute of CPC History and Party Building at Beijing Normal University, the great significance of ""the second combination"" is explained from the perspective of ideological liberation, which indicates that the second combination is a great significance for the CPC. ""The great significance of the second combination indicates that our Party has made a new leap in its understanding of the mechanism of the guiding role of Marxism, a new vision of the modernization of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and a new height in its understanding of the fit between Marxism and the excellent traditional Chinese culture. Marxism has scientifically revealed the law of development of human society, pointed out the path of human emancipation, and advanced the process of human civilization, but ""Marx's whole worldview is not a doctrine, but a method. It offers not ready-made dogmas, but points of departure for further research and methods for such research."" The vitality and vigor of Marxism lies in its integration with the concrete realities of individual countries and nations. Under the guidance of Marxism, China's outstanding traditional culture has once again gained vitality, transforming into the infinite power of culturing people in the new era, and establishing a Chinese cultural tradition that has been inherited from the ancient times to the present day. We have always emphasized the guiding role of Marxism and the need to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditional Chinese culture. However, in the past, we have not paid enough attention to the fit and compatibility between the two, and there has even been a tendency to replace or suppress one ideology with another. In fact, after Marxism was introduced to China, the fact that the idea of scientific socialism was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and eventually took root and blossomed on the Chinese soil was by no means accidental, but rather lies in the fact that it is compatible with the excellent historical culture of our country, which has been inherited for thousands of years, and with the values that the general public uses on a daily basis without being aware of them. Let Marxism become China's, China's excellent traditional culture become modern The People's Daily published an article pointing out that we need to deeply understand and grasp the significance of the ""second combination"", better promote the ""second combination"", so that Marxism becomes China's, China's excellent traditional culture becomes modern. The second combination is to make Marxism Chinese, and the excellent traditional Chinese culture modern. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture, reflects the will of the Chinese people, and suits the requirements of development and progress in China and the times, and has a profound historical origin and a broad practical foundation. The road to socialism with Chinese characteristics is under the guidance of Marxism, and is also drawn from the history of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization. Only by building on the profound Chinese traditional culture can we truly understand and grasp the historical necessity, cultural heritage and unique advantages of China's road, theory and system. The ""second combination"" reflects the historical self-confidence and historical initiative of the CPC in the new era, and highlights the cultural self-confidence and cultural responsibility of the CPC in the new era. Promoting the ""second combination"" will enable us to more profoundly grasp the historical origin, developmental lineage, and basic direction of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, deeply understand the unique creation, value concepts, and distinctive features of the Chinese culture, deeply excavate and expound the ideological essence, ethical quintessence, and contemporary values contained therein, and strive to demonstrate the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation, and better construct the Chinese spirit. We will strive to demonstrate the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation, and better construct the Chinese spirit, Chinese values and Chinese power. The outstanding innovative nature of Chinese civilization fundamentally determines the enterprising spirit of the Chinese nation, which is to abide by the right and not the old, to respect the ancient and not to revert to the past, and the fearlessness of the Chinese nation, which is not afraid of new challenges and is willing to accept new things. In the historical process of promoting the ""second combination"", the Party has used Marxism to activate the vital and excellent factors of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and to give them new connotations for the times, injecting the great spirit and rich wisdom of the Chinese nation into Marxism at a deeper level, so as to make Marxism Chinese and the excellent traditional Chinese culture modern. to make Marxism Chinese and the excellent traditional Chinese culture modern. The Party's self-consciousness in promoting cultural innovation in the inheritance of the excellent traditional Chinese culture has reached a new height Zhou Feng and Niu Zezhen, special researchers at the Guangdong Xi Jinping Research Center for Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, have jointly published an article pointing out that a profound understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important exposition on the ""second combination"" is a key factor in continuing to promote cultural prosperity and the development of the Chinese culture from a new historical starting point. A profound understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discussion on the ""second combination"" is a fundamental guideline for us to continue to promote cultural prosperity, build a strong cultural country, and build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation at the new starting point. The ""second combination"" is a profound summary of the Party's historical experience of the modernization of Marxism, a profound grasp of the laws of the development of Chinese civilization, and indicates that the Party's understanding of the road, theory and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics has reached a new height, that the Party's historical and cultural self-confidence has reached a new height, and that the Party's ability to inherit the outstanding traditional Chinese culture has reached a new level of confidence in the Chinese culture. Our Party's self-consciousness in promoting cultural innovation in the inheritance of the excellent traditional Chinese culture has reached a new height. ""Although the Zhou is an old state, its life is new."" To continue to promote cultural prosperity, build a strong cultural country, and build a modern civilization of the Chinese nation from a new historical starting point, we must insist on not forgetting the past, absorbing the past, facing the future, adhering to the righteousness and innovation, and firming up our cultural self-confidence and self-empowerment, so as to solidly push forward the construction of a modern civilization of the Chinese nation and a socialist cultural power, and to compose a new chapter of the era of the Chinese civilization. It contains profound theoretical, value and practical logic Wu Mingyong, dean and professor of the School of Marxism at Shaanxi University of Science and Technology and researcher at the Research Center for Socialist Theory System with Chinese Characteristics in Shaanxi Province, wrote that General Secretary Xi Jinping's major assertion about the ""second combination"" contains profound theoretical, value and practical logic. The logic of theory, value and practice is embedded in it. From the perspective of theoretical logic, the ""second combination"" is an in-depth interpretation of the mechanism of the Chineseization of Marxism. The specific expression of the assertion of ""the second combination"" has already clearly pointed out the objects to be combined, namely, ""the basic principles of Marxism"" and ""the excellent traditional Chinese culture"". The reason why the two can be combined is that they are highly compatible. From the perspective of value logic, the ""second combination"" is a deep concern for the demand for the modernization of Marxism. Continuously promoting the ""second combination"" is of vital value and significance to China's economic and social development and to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. From the perspective of practical logic, the ""second combination"" injects spiritual strength into the promotion of Chinese-style modernization. ""Combining the basic principles of Marxism with Chinese traditional culture is a theoretical proposition, but also a practical issue. The proposal of the ""second combination"" points out the way for the protection, inheritance and development of Chinese outstanding traditional culture, as well as its integration with Marxism. (Source: People's Daily, Guangming Daily)","The ""second combination"" is a significant concept in which Marxism, the guiding ideology of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is fused with China's rich traditional culture. This fusion aims to make Marxism Chinese, while also modernizing the traditional culture so that it fits seamlessly into contemporary China. The CCP views this combination as vital for its governance of the country and the continued development of China's society and economy. This concept also showed the CCP's confidence in the compatibility of Marxism and China's traditional culture."
让一切文化创造源泉充分涌流 来源：人民网－人民日报 作者：辛 鸣 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-10 17:03:11 0,文化兴国运兴，文化强民族强。习近平总书记指出：“人类社会每一次跃进，人类文明每一次升华，无不伴随着文化的历史性进步。”回顾近代以来的历史可以发现，中华民族从生死危亡走向奋起复兴、中国从传统社会迈向现代社会的历程，也是中华文化焕发活力、重铸辉煌的历程。习近平总书记在对宣传思想文化工作的重要指示中强调：“充分激发全民族文化创新创造活力”。在推进中国式现代化的新征程上，我们要坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入学习贯彻习近平文化思想，坚定文化自信、秉持开放包容、坚持守正创新，充分激发全民族文化创新创造活力，为强国建设、民族复兴注入强大精神力量。 坚定文化自信，牢牢把握社会主义先进文化前进方向 习近平总书记指出：“文明特别是思想文化是一个国家、一个民族的灵魂。无论哪一个国家、哪一个民族，如果不珍惜自己的思想文化，丢掉了思想文化这个灵魂，这个国家、这个民族是立不起来的。”激发全民族文化创新创造活力，坚定文化自信是前提、是基础。只有对自身文化理想、文化价值充满信心，对自身文化生命力、创造力充满信心，才能有坚持坚守的定力、奋起奋发的勇气、创新创造的活力。 坚定文化自信，是因为中国特色社会主义文化积淀着中华民族最深沉的精神追求，代表着中华民族独特的精神标识，是激励全党全国各族人民奋勇前进的强大精神力量。中国特色社会主义文化源自于中华民族5000多年文明历史所孕育的中华优秀传统文化，熔铸于党领导人民在革命、建设、改革中创造的革命文化和社会主义先进文化，植根于中国特色社会主义伟大实践。我们的文化自信从历史传承中来，从革命奋斗中来，从改革创新中来。中华文化博大精深、源远流长，涌现出老子、孔子、庄子、孟子等闻名于世的伟大思想巨匠，诞生了诗经、汉赋、唐诗、宋词、元曲等浩如烟海的文学经典，为中华民族生生不息、薪火相传提供了精神滋养。革命文化和社会主义先进文化是在长期艰苦奋斗中不断淬炼的文化精华，井冈山精神、长征精神、“两弹一星”精神、雷锋精神、抗震救灾精神、载人航天精神、脱贫攻坚精神……这些宝贵精神财富是推动革命、建设、改革事业从胜利走向胜利的强大精神动力。可以说，坚定文化自信，我们有充分的理由、有强大的底气。 特别是新时代以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央把文化建设提升到一个新的历史高度，把文化自信作为坚持和发展中国特色社会主义最根本的自信，作为激励全体人民奋勇前进的强大精神力量，把坚持马克思主义在意识形态领域指导地位的制度确立为中国特色社会主义制度体系的一项根本制度，把坚持社会主义核心价值体系纳入新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的基本方略，推动我国文化建设正本清源、守正创新。新时代党的创新理论深入人心，社会主义核心价值观广泛传播，中华优秀传统文化得到创造性转化、创新性发展，文化事业日益繁荣，网络生态持续向好，意识形态领域形势发生全局性、根本性转变。中国人民的历史主动精神极大焕发，文化自信心显著增强，文化主体性得到极大巩固，文化创新创造活力竞相迸发，为新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义、开创党和国家事业新局面提供了更为主动的精神力量。 坚定文化自信，文化主体性就会更加巩固，也就有了文化意义上更加坚定的自我；中国共产党就有了引领时代的强大文化力量，中华民族和中国人民就有了国家认同的坚实文化基础，中华文明就有了和世界其他文明交流互鉴的鲜明文化特性。把文化自信融入全民族的精神气质与文化品格中，养成昂扬向上的风貌和理性平和的心态，我们的文化创新创造就具有无比深厚的历史底蕴，具有无比强大的前进动力。 秉持开放包容，学习借鉴人类创造的一切优秀文明成果 文化的创新创造不是孤芳自赏、固步自封、闭门造车，而是在广泛深入的交流互鉴中取长补短、相得益彰、美美与共。中华文明历经5000多年风雨沧桑而绵延不绝，不断发扬光大，一个非常重要的原因就在于开放包容。从历史上看，佛教、伊斯兰教、基督教等域外文化先后传入中国，同以儒家文化为代表的中国传统文化交流、沟通与融合。进入近代，西方的天文学、医学、数学、几何学、地理学等开始激荡中国人的头脑，“西学东渐”让中华文化因不断吸纳新鲜的知识、新鲜的理念、新鲜的视角而焕发新的活力。特别是来自欧洲的马克思主义，用真理的力量激活了中华民族历经几千年创造的伟大文明，使中华文明再次迸发出强大精神力量。 习近平总书记指出：“秉持开放包容，就是要更加积极主动地学习借鉴人类创造的一切优秀文明成果。”激发全民族文化创新创造活力，提升文化凝聚力感召力，增强中华文明传播力影响力，都离不开贯通古今、融通中外。经过长期努力，我们比以往任何一个时代都更有条件破解“古今中西之争”，也比以往任何一个时代都更迫切需要一批熔铸古今、汇通中西的文化成果，进而不断繁荣和发展新时代中国特色社会主义文化。以开放包容的胸怀从不同文明中寻求智慧、汲取营养，可以为人们提供有益启发，激发文化创新创造灵感，推动携手解决人类共同面临的各种挑战，开创更加美好的未来。值得注意的是，开放包容不是邯郸学步，不是反客为主，更不是依附盲从。我们要虚心学习借鉴人类社会创造的一切优秀文明成果，但不能数典忘祖、照抄照搬。 科学有益的开放包容要有充分的精神主动，做好“化”的功夫。习近平总书记指出：“对丰富多彩的世界，我们应该秉持兼容并蓄的态度，虚心学习他人的好东西，在独立自主的立场上把他人的好东西加以消化吸收，化成我们自己的好东西，但决不能囫囵吞枣、决不能邯郸学步。”我们的文明是善于学习、勇于拿来的文明。历史上，我们把印度文明中的佛教“化”为了中国佛教。有了这种兼容并蓄、海纳百川的品格和以我为主、为我所用的立场，中华文化创新创造的活力就会竞相迸发、充分涌流。兼收并蓄需要坚定的自信，消化吸收需要创造的能力。我们要注重将人类文明的优秀成果进行“化育”，把他人的好东西变成我们的营养剂，滋养我们自己的文化，形成我们的民族特色，使我们的文明更具活力、更加强大。 坚持守正创新，为强国建设、民族复兴注入强大精神力量 推进文化建设，守正才能不迷失自我、不迷失方向，创新才能把握时代、引领时代。激发全民族文化创新创造活力，守正创新是必然要求，也是重要方法论。 我们要坚持马克思主义在意识形态领域指导地位的根本制度。坚持以什么思想理论为指导，是文化建设的首要问题，关系到政党的性质、国家的方向，关系到民族的命脉、人心的凝聚。社会主义先进文化之所以先进，就在于它坚持以马克思主义这一先进理论为指导。正是因为有马克思主义这个共同的思想基础，才能凝聚起全党全国各族人民的意志和力量，不断克服前进道路上各种艰难险阻，从胜利走向新的胜利。 我们要坚持“两个结合”的根本要求。习近平总书记指出：“在五千多年中华文明深厚基础上开辟和发展中国特色社会主义，把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际、同中华优秀传统文化相结合是必由之路。”这是我们在探索中国特色社会主义道路中得出的规律性认识。只有坚持“两个结合”，坚持运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，才能正确回答时代和实践提出的重大问题，才能始终保持马克思主义的蓬勃生机和旺盛活力。 我们要坚持党的文化领导权和中华民族的文化主体性。坚持党的文化领导权是事关党和国家前途命运的大事。习近平总书记深刻总结党的历史经验、洞察时代发展大势，提出坚持党的文化领导权，作出“必须把意识形态工作的领导权、管理权、话语权牢牢掌握在手中”“坚持政治家办报、办刊、办台、办新闻网站”等一系列重要论述，充分体现了对新时代文化地位作用的深刻认识，对党的意识形态工作的科学把握。我们的文化主体性是中国共产党带领中国人民在中国大地上建立起来的；是在创造性转化、创新性发展中华优秀传统文化，继承革命文化，发展社会主义先进文化的基础上，借鉴吸收人类一切优秀文明成果的基础上建立起来的；是通过把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际、同中华优秀传统文化相结合建立起来的。创立习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想就是这一文化主体性的最有力体现。我们要在巩固文化主体性中坚持和发展当代中国马克思主义、21世纪马克思主义，紧密结合时代条件和实践要求推进理论创新创造。 文化是最需要创新的领域，创新是文化的本质特征和生命力所在。文化创新创造不能停留在对具体文化内容的简单重复，而是要运用新思路、新话语、新机制、新形式，在马克思主义指导下真正做到古为今用、洋为中用、辩证取舍、推陈出新，实现传统与现代的有机衔接。要按照时代特点和要求，通过创造性转化，对那些至今仍有借鉴价值的内涵和陈旧的表现形式加以改造，赋予其新的时代内涵和现代表达形式以激活生命力；通过创新性发展，对中华优秀传统文化的内涵加以补充、拓展、完善，使中华民族最基本的文化基因与当代文化相适应、与现代社会相协调，努力在实践创造中进行文化创造，在历史进步中实现文化进步，让一切文化创造源泉充分涌流，让中国特色社会主义文化始终反映时代精神、引领时代潮流。 （作者为中央党校（国家行政学院）习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心研究员） 《 人民日报 》（ 2023年11月10日 13 版）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231112000347/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265949.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110092408/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265949.html,2023-11-12 0:00:00,Let all sources of cultural creativity fully flow Source: people.com.cn - People's Daily Author: Xin Ming Editor in Chief: Li Jiaqi 2023-11-10 17:03:11 0,"Culture is a vital part of a nation's prosperity, and culture is a vital part of a nation's strength. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""every leap forward in human society and every sublimation of human civilization is accompanied by a historic advance in culture."" Looking back at the history of modern times, we can see that the journey of the Chinese nation from life and death to revival and the journey of China from a traditional society to a modern society is also the journey of revitalizing Chinese culture and recreating its glory. General Secretary Xi Jinping, in his important instructions on propaganda, ideology and culture, emphasized, ""Fully stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation."" On the new journey of promoting Chinese-style modernization, we should adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Culture in depth, firmly grasp cultural self-confidence, uphold openness and inclusiveness, and insist on observing the correctness and innovation, so as to fully stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, and to infuse a powerful spiritual force into the construction of a strong country and the rejuvenation of the nation. Firmly grasp the direction of advanced socialist culture with cultural self-confidence General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Civilization, especially ideology and culture, is the soul of a country and a nation. Regardless of which country or nation, if it does not cherish its own ideology and culture and loses the soul of its ideology and culture, the country or nation will not be able to stand up."" To stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, firm cultural self-confidence is the prerequisite and foundation. Only when you are confident in your own cultural ideals and values, and confident in your own cultural vitality and creativity, can you have the determination to persevere, the courage to rise up, and the vigor to innovate and create. The reason for the firm cultural confidence is that the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics has accumulated the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese nation, represents the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation, and is a powerful spiritual force that inspires the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups to move forward. Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics originates from the excellent traditional Chinese culture nurtured by the 5,000 years of civilization of the Chinese nation, is fused with the revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture created by the Party under the leadership of the people in revolution, construction and reform, and is rooted in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our cultural self-confidence comes from historical inheritance, from revolutionary struggle, and from reform and innovation. Chinese culture is profound and far-reaching, and has produced great masters of thought such as Laozi, Confucius, Zhuangzi and Mencius, as well as literary classics such as the Classic of Poetry, the Han Fugue, Tang poems, Song lyrics, and Yuan operas, which provide spiritual nourishment for the Chinese nation to continue to live on and to pass on the flame. Revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture are cultural essences that have been continuously refined in the course of long and arduous struggles. The spirit of the Jinggang Mountains, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of the two bombs and one star, the spirit of the Lei Feng, the spirit of anti-earthquake and disaster relief, the spirit of human spaceflight, and the spirit of poverty alleviation and eradication are all valuable spiritual treasures that have contributed to the development of the revolution, the revolution and the socialist movement. Valuable spiritual wealth is a powerful spiritual impetus to promote the cause of revolution, construction and reform from victory to victory. It can be said that, firm cultural confidence, we have sufficient reasons, have a strong backbone. Especially since the new era, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has elevated cultural construction to a new historical level, taken cultural self-confidence as the most fundamental self-confidence in adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and as a powerful spiritual force to inspire all the people to move forward, established the system of adhering to the guiding position of Marxism in the field of ideology as one of the fundamental systems of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics , incorporating adherence to the socialist core value system into the basic strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and promoting China's cultural construction to rectify its origins and keep it on the right track. In the new era, the Party's innovative theories have taken root in people's hearts, socialist core values have been widely disseminated, the excellent traditional Chinese culture has been creatively transformed and innovatively developed, cultural undertakings have become increasingly prosperous, the network ecology has continued to improve, and the situation in the field of ideology has undergone an overall and fundamental transformation. The Chinese people's spirit of historical initiative has been greatly renewed, cultural self-confidence has been significantly strengthened, cultural subjectivity has been greatly consolidated, and the vigor of cultural innovation and creativity has competed and burst forth, providing a more proactive spiritual force for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and for opening up a new situation for the cause of the Party and the country. With firm cultural self-confidence, cultural subjectivity will be more consolidated, and there will be a firmer self in the cultural sense; the CPC will have a strong cultural power to lead the times, the Chinese nation and the Chinese people will have a solid cultural foundation for national identity, and the Chinese civilization will have a distinctive cultural identity for exchanges and mutual understanding with other civilizations in the world. By integrating cultural self-confidence into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the whole nation, and by cultivating a vigorous and upward-looking outlook and a rational and calm mindset, our cultural innovation and creation will have an incomparably deep historical background and an incomparably strong impetus to move forward. Adhering to openness and inclusiveness, learning from all the outstanding civilization achievements created by mankind Cultural innovation and creation is not to be appreciated in isolation, stagnation, and closed-door car-making, but rather, in the extensive and in-depth exchanges and mutual learning to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and complement each other, and the beauty of the commonwealth. One of the most important reasons why Chinese civilization has endured the vicissitudes of more than 5,000 years and continued to flourish is that it is open and tolerant. Historically, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and other foreign cultures have been introduced to China, exchanging, communicating and integrating with traditional Chinese culture represented by Confucianism. In modern times, Western astronomy, medicine, mathematics, geometry, geography, etc. began to stimulate the minds of the Chinese people, ""Western learning"" so that the Chinese culture is constantly absorbing fresh knowledge, fresh ideas, fresh perspectives and new vitality. In particular, Marxism from Europe has activated the great civilization created by the Chinese nation over thousands of years with the power of truth, making Chinese civilization once again burst with powerful spiritual strength. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""To uphold openness and inclusiveness means to more actively and proactively study and learn from all the outstanding civilization fruits created by mankind."" To stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, to enhance the cohesive appeal of culture, and to strengthen the spreading power and influence of Chinese civilization, it is indispensable to connect the ancient and the modern, and to integrate the Chinese and the foreign. After a long period of effort, we are in a better position than in any previous era to solve the ""ancient, modern, Chinese and Western controversy"", and there is an urgent need for a batch of cultural achievements that fuse the ancient and the modern and the Chinese and the Western, so as to continue to flourish and develop the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Seeking wisdom and drawing nourishment from different civilizations with an open and tolerant mind can provide people with useful inspiration, stimulate cultural innovation and creativity, and promote joint efforts to solve the challenges faced by mankind and create a better future. It is worth noting that openness and inclusiveness is not about learning from others, not about being the master of others, and not about adhering to others blindly. We should humbly learn from all the excellent civilization achievements created by human society, but we should not forget our ancestors and copy them. Scientific and beneficial openness and inclusiveness should have sufficient spiritual initiative, and do a good job of ""transformation"". General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: ""to the rich and colorful world, we should uphold the attitude of eclecticism, humility to learn the good things of others, in the independent position of the good things of others to be digested and assimilated into our own good things, but never swallowed in one gulp, and never learn from Handan."" Our civilization is a civilization that is good at learning and has the courage to bring in. Historically, we have ""transformed"" Buddhism from Indian civilization into Chinese Buddhism. With this kind of eclecticism, the character of the sea and the stance of our own, for my use, the vitality of Chinese cultural innovation and creativity will be competing, full flow. Inclusion requires firm self-confidence, and digestion and absorption require the ability to create. We should pay attention to the excellent achievements of human civilization, turn the good things of others into our nutrients, nourish our own culture, and form our national characteristics, so as to make our civilization more vigorous and stronger. Adhere to the right and innovation, for the construction of a strong country, national rejuvenation, injecting a strong spiritual force to promote the construction of culture, to keep the right in order not to lose themselves, not to lose their way, and innovation in order to grasp the times, leading the times. To stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, keeping the right and innovating is an inevitable requirement and an important methodology. We must adhere to the fundamental system of Marxism's guiding position in the ideological field. Adhering to what ideology and theory should guide us is the primary issue of cultural construction, which is related to the nature of political parties and the direction of the country, as well as the lifeblood of the nation and the cohesion of people's hearts. The advanced socialist culture is advanced because it insists on being guided by the advanced theory of Marxism. It is precisely because of the common ideological foundation of Marxism that we can unite the will and strength of the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups, constantly overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, and move from victory to new victory. We must adhere to the fundamental requirement of ""two combinations"". General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""to open up and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics on the basis of the profound foundation of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture is the way to go."" This is the regular understanding we have gained from exploring the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Only by adhering to the ""two combinations"" and the use of dialectical materialism and historical materialism can we correctly answer the major questions raised by the times and practice, and maintain the vitality and vigor of Marxism at all times. We must insist on the Party's cultural leadership and the cultural subjectivity of the Chinese nation. Insisting on the Party's cultural leadership is a major matter concerning the future destiny of the Party and the country. General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly summarized the Party's historical experience and gained insights into the development trend of the times, and put forward a series of important statements such as ""we must firmly grasp the leadership, management and discourse power of ideological work in our hands"" and ""we must insist that politicians run newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and news websites"". A series of important expositions, such as ""insisting that politicians run newspapers, magazines, radio stations and news websites"", have fully embodied a profound understanding of the status and role of culture in the new era and a scientific grasp of the Party's ideological work. Our cultural subjectivity was established by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of the Chinese people on the Chinese soil; it was established on the basis of creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, inheritance of the revolutionary culture, development of the advanced socialist culture, and borrowing and absorbing all the excellent civilization achievements of mankind; it was established by combining the basic principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China and with the excellent traditional Chinese culture. It is established by combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's excellent traditional culture. The creation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the strongest manifestation of this cultural subjectivity. We should adhere to and develop contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century Marxism in consolidating cultural subjectivity, and promote theoretical innovation and creation in close connection with the conditions of the times and the requirements of practice. Culture is the field that needs innovation the most, and innovation is the essential characteristic and vitality of culture. Cultural innovation and creation should not remain in the simple repetition of specific cultural contents, but should use new ideas, new words, new mechanisms and new forms, and under the guidance of Marxism, it should really make use of the past for the present and the foreign for the Chinese, and dialectically take and give, and push forward the new, so as to realize the organic convergence of tradition and modernity. In accordance with the characteristics and requirements of the times, through creative transformation, those connotations and obsolete forms of expression that are still of value today should be transformed and given new connotations for the times and modern forms of expression to activate their vitality; through innovative development, the connotations of the excellent traditional Chinese culture should be supplemented, expanded and perfected, so as to make the most basic cultural genes of the Chinese nation compatible with contemporary culture and harmonized with modern society. The Chinese government is also striving to create culture in the midst of practical creativity and to realize cultural progress in the midst of historical progress, so that all sources of cultural creativity can fully flow, and so that socialist culture with Chinese characteristics can always reflect the spirit of the times and lead the trend of the times. (The author is a researcher at the Xi Jinping Center for the Study of Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era at the Central Party School (National School of Administration)) The People's Daily (November 10, 2023, 13)","The article emphasizes the importance of stimulating the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity in the whole nation, in order to infuse a powerful spiritual force into the construction of a strong country and the rejuvenation of the nation. It highlights the need for a firm grasp of cultural self-confidence, openness and inclusiveness, as well as adhering to the right and innovation. The Chinese culture, with its deep and far-reaching spiritual pursuit, has produced great masters of thought, literature, and art, and the legacy of revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture is a valuable cultural treasure that has contributed to the development of the revolution, construction, and reform. By integrating cultural self-confidence into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the whole nation, and by cultivating a vigorous and upward-looking outlook, our cultural innovation and creation will have a solid cultural foundation, and the Chinese civilization will have a distinctive cultural identity for exchanges and mutual understanding with other civilizations in the world."
思想战线丨强固党指挥枪的根本之举 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：曹二刚 朱洪杰 车兴飞 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-10 06:06:16 0,强固党指挥枪的根本之举 ——怎么看深化军委主席负责制贯彻落实 回望新时代的时间航道，总有一些历史的关键瞬间，因为其具有的重大深远意义而成为永恒。2012年11月，在党的十八大后召开的第一次军委常务会议上，习主席亲自主持审议修订《中央军事委员会工作规则》，郑重写上中央军事委员会实行主席负责制。2017年10月，在党的十九大上，第一次将“中央军事委员会实行主席负责制”写入党章，这一制度在党的根本大法中确立下来，上升为全党必须共同遵守的根本行为规范。2022年10月，党的二十大明确提出“健全贯彻军委主席负责制体制机制”，这充分体现了党中央持续推进军委主席负责制贯彻落实的坚定意志。军委主席负责制是坚持党对军队绝对领导的根本制度和根本实现形式，确保枪杆子永远听党指挥，必须以更高标准、更严要求贯彻军委主席负责制。 为什么说党的十八大以来贯彻军委主席负责制严起来、实起来了？ 党的十八大以来，党中央和中央军委对贯彻军委主席负责制高度重视，作出一系列政治设计和制度安排，取得重大理论成果、实践成果、制度成果，为我军实现伟大变革提供了根本制度保障。 在重塑构建体制中严起来、实起来。2016年1月16日零时，沈阳、北京、兰州、济南、南京、广州、成都七大军区停止行使指挥权，东部、南部、西部、北部、中部五大战区开始运转。这对人民解放军来说是一个历史性时刻。这一轮国防和军队改革，重塑我军领导指挥体制，优化规模结构和力量编成，形成更加有利于贯彻军委主席负责制的全新体制架构。按照军委管总、战区主战、军种主建的总原则，构建中央军委—战区—部队的作战指挥体系，构建中央军委—军种—部队的领导管理体系，构建严密的权力运行制约和监督体系，实行中央军委—武警部队—部队领导指挥体制，预备役部队全面纳入军队领导指挥体系，强化军委集中统一领导，更好使军队最高领导权和指挥权集中于党中央和中央军委。 在完善政策制度中严起来、实起来。党的十八大以来，党中央、中央军委坚持以确保党对军队绝对领导为指向，深入推进军事政策制度改革，为全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制提供制度保证。党中央、中央军委批准颁布的《中国共产党军队党的建设条例》，明确了军委主席负责制的地位作用，明确了全面深入贯彻的内涵要求、工作机制和责任体系，使贯彻军委主席负责制的制度机制更加成熟完善。《军队政治工作条例》《中国共产党军队委员会（支部）工作规定》《中国人民解放军联合作战纲要（试行）》等重要法规，都将贯彻军委主席负责制的要求进一步固化下来。 在推进工作落实中严起来、实起来。2018年3月底至6月底，中央军委首次部署开展全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制专项巡视，紧盯自觉看齐追随、加强政治整训、落实中央八项规定精神和军委十项规定及其实施细则精神等方面存在的问题发力，推动军委主席负责制坚决、全面、具体、无条件贯彻落实。党的十八大以来，中央军委修订《中央军事委员会工作规则》，印发《关于全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制的意见》，建立和落实请示报告、督促检查、信息服务工作机制，出台批示指示督办落实、重大事项请示报告、监督问责等方面措施规定……一项项重大部署、一条条制度规范，形成“横向到边、纵向到底、左右衔接”的责任链条，推动军委主席负责制贯彻到国防和军队建设各方面全过程。 为什么说军委主席负责制是“两个确立”在人民军队落地生根的重要制度保证？ 全票当选！2023年3月10日上午，出席十四届全国人大一次会议第三次全体会议的2900多名代表以无记名投票方式，选举习近平总书记继续担任中华人民共和国主席、中华人民共和国中央军事委员会主席。这充分体现了党的意志、人民意志、国家意志的高度统一，充分反映了全党全军全国各族人民的共同心愿。 北京展览馆，新中国第一个大型综合性展馆。2022年10月，“奋进新时代”主题成就展在这里展出。6个展区，图片、实物、模型等6000多项展览要素，浓缩着新时代10年的伟大变革。一个个实物映照初心使命，一组组图表诉说神州巨变，一件件装备见证强军成就……这10年，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，根本在于党确立习近平总书记党中央的核心、全党的核心地位，确立习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的指导地位。“两个确立”是党在新时代取得的重大政治成果，是做好一切工作的信心之本，是战胜一切艰难险阻、应对一切不确定性的最大确定性、最大底气、最大保证，事关党的兴衰成败，事关中国特色社会主义前途命运，事关国家长治久安和中华民族伟大复兴。 党政军民学，东西南北中，党是领导一切的，是最高的政治领导力量。坚持党的领导，首先是做到“两个维护”。对人民军队来说，坚持党对军队的绝对领导，首要的是坚持我军最高领导权和指挥权属于党中央、中央军委。做到这一条，就必须全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制，由军委主席对我军重大问题最后拍板、一锤定音。从中我们可以看出，军队拥护“两个确立”与贯彻军委主席负责制是内在一致的，两者统一于坚持党中央集中统一领导这个最高政治原则，统一于坚决听从党中央、中央军委和习主席指挥。所以说，全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制，就能确保“两个确立”在部队固牢扎深，确保把习主席和中央军委决策部署落到实处。在强国建设、民族复兴的新征程上，我们必须把对“两个确立”决定性意义的深刻领悟转化为做到“两个维护”、贯彻军委主席负责制的高度自觉，更加坚定自觉地忠诚核心、拥戴核心、维护核心、捍卫核心，切实做到听习主席指挥、对习主席负责、让习主席放心。 如何认识健全贯彻军委主席负责制体制机制？ 党的二十大闭幕不久，中央军委印发《关于深化军委主席负责制贯彻落实的若干意见》《全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制的若干规定》。随后，中央军委办公厅印发军委主席负责制学习教育规划。出台这一系列重要法规文件，就是要着力破解在贯彻军委主席负责制方面存在的理解把握不够到位、执行相关制度机制不够严格、担当作为不够主动等问题。比如，在深入开展军委主席负责制学习教育上，明确总体要求、基本内容、重点任务和组织保障，要求分类分级开展针对性学习教育，强调准确掌握军委主席负责制的重大意义、重要内涵和实践要求，夯实贯彻执行的思想政治基础；在提高“三项机制”执行质量上，要求严格执行请示报告制度、加大督促检查力度、优化信息服务工作，明确有关内容、程序和要求，确保习主席牢牢掌握部队、高效指挥部队。 如果我们把一套制度比作一部复杂精密的机器，那么健全的体制就像完整的部件，完善的机制如同保障其高效运行的“润滑剂”。健全贯彻军委主席负责制体制机制，就是要将行之有效的经验成果固化下来，着力增强相关制度机制的系统性和操作性，不断推进贯彻军委主席负责制法治化、规范化、程序化。各级要把贯彻军委主席负责制作为最高政治要求来遵循，作为最高政治纪律来严守，加强组织领导，细化相关措施，提高贯彻质量，确保军委主席负责制各项要求一贯到底，确保习主席决策指示落到末端。 为什么说贯彻军委主席负责制要害在担当、关键靠实干？ 全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制，是严肃而重大的政治责任，是全军的共同责任，必须正确处理好集中统一领导和按级分工负责的关系，该请示报告的必须请示报告，该自己负责的必须真正负好责，既不超越权限，又不推诿责任。各级领导干部要发挥示范带头作用，提高政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力，把该担的责任担起来，敢于负责，大胆工作，锐意进取，确保军委主席负责制落到实处。 2023年5月，海军潜艇部队某艇员队全体官兵收到一封特殊的回信。习主席在信中勉励他们：牢记党和人民重托，不断提高履行使命任务能力，努力锻造全面过硬的水下尖兵，为实现建军一百年奋斗目标作出更大贡献。10年前，习主席来到该艇员队官兵中间，同他们共进午餐、深入交流，希望他们在大风大浪、远海大洋中磨炼意志、茁壮成长。10年来，该艇员队官兵牢记统帅嘱托，忠诚履职尽责，圆满完成战备远航、试验演训等多项重大任务，中央军委先后两次为他们记集体一等功。全面深入贯彻军委主席负责制，不是抽象的原则、空洞的口号，必须落实到行动上，坚持全部精力向打仗聚焦，全部工作向打仗用劲，不折不扣贯彻执行党中央、中央军委和习主席的决策指示，有效履行新时代我军使命任务。 （执笔：曹二刚、朱洪杰、车兴飞）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231112000347/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265912.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110094539/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16265912.html,2023-11-12 0:00:00,Ideological Front丨Strengthening the Party's fundamental move to command the gun Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Cao Ergang Zhu Hongjie Che Xingfei Editor-in-Chief：Yixi拉姆 2023-11-10 06:06:16 0,"The fundamental move of strengthening the Party's command of the gun - how to see deepening the implementation of the system of responsibility of the chairman of the military commission Looking back at the time course of the new era, there are always some key moments in history, because of their great far-reaching significance and become eternal.In November 2012, in the first executive meeting of the military commission after the 18th Party Congress, President Xi personally presided over the revision of the rules of work of the Central Military Commission, and solemnly wrote that the Central Military Commission implements the system of responsibility of the chairman.

In October 2022, the 20th Party Congress explicitly proposed to ""improve the institutional mechanism for the implementation of the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission"", which fully embodies the firm will of the Party Central Committee to continue to promote the implementation of the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission. The system of responsibility of the chairman of the military commission is to adhere to the fundamental system and fundamental form of realization of the absolute leadership of the party over the army, to ensure that the gun barrel will always listen to the party's command, it is necessary to carry out the system of responsibility of the chairman of the military commission to a higher standard and more stringent requirements. Why do you say that since the 18th CPC National Congress, the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission has been strict and practical? Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission have attached great importance to the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and have made a series of political designs and institutional arrangements, and have achieved significant theoretical, practical, and institutional achievements, which have provided fundamental institutional safeguards for the realization of the great changes in our military. Strict and practical in reshaping and building the system.At 00:00 on January 16, 2016, the seven military regions of Shenyang, Beijing, Lanzhou, Jinan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu ceased to exercise command, and the five major war zones in the east, south, west, north, and central China began to function. This is a historic moment for the People's Liberation Army. This round of national defense and military reform has reshaped the leadership and command system of the PLA, optimized the size and structure of its forces, and formed a brand new institutional structure that is more conducive to the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. In accordance with the general principle that the military commission is in charge of the general administration, the battle area is in charge of the war, and the military service is in charge of the construction, the operational command system of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the battle area - the troops is constructed, the leadership management system of the CMC - the military service - the troops is constructed, the tight system of constraints on the operation of power and supervision is constructed, and the system of The Central Military Commission-Armed Police Force-Force Leadership and Command System, the full integration of reserve forces into the military leadership and command system, the strengthening of the Centralized and Unified Leadership of the Military Commission, and the better centralization of the supreme leadership and command of the military in the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Strict and practical in improving the policy system. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission have insisted on ensuring the absolute leadership of the CPC over the military, and have pushed forward the reform of the military policy and system in depth, so as to provide a systematic guarantee for the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. The Regulations on Party Construction of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Army, approved and promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, clearly define the status and role of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and specify the connotation requirements, working mechanism and responsibility system for comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system, so as to make the system and mechanism for implementing the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission more mature and complete. Important regulations such as the Regulations on the Political Work of the Army, the Regulations on the Work of the Committees (Branches) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Army, and the Outline of the Joint Warfare of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (for Trial Implementation) have further solidified the requirements for the implementation of the system of chairmanship responsibility of the Military Commission. The Central Military Commission (CMC) deployed for the first time from the end of March to the end of June 2018 to carry out a special inspection for the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission (CMC), focusing on the problems that exist in the areas of conscientiously watching and following, strengthening political training, and implementing the spirit of the eight provisions of the Central Authorities and the spirit of the ten provisions of the CMC and its implementing rules, so as to promote the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the CMC to implement the system resolutely, comprehensively, concretely, and unconditionally.

Why is the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission an important system to ensure that the ""two establishments"" take root in the people's army? On the morning of March 10, 2023, more than 2,900 delegates attending the third plenary session of the First Session of the 14th National People's Congress voted by secret ballot to elect General Secretary Xi Jinping to continue to serve as President of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China. This fully embodies the high degree of unity among the will of the Party, the will of the people and the will of the State, and fully reflects the common aspiration of the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation of all ethnic groups. Beijing Exhibition Center, the first large-scale comprehensive exhibition hall in new China, where the theme of ""Advancing into the New Era"" was displayed in October 2022. 6 exhibition areas with more than 6,000 exhibition elements, such as pictures, objects, models, etc., condensed the great changes of the new era in the past 10 years. A physical object reflects the initial mission, a group of charts to tell the great changes in China, a piece of equipment to witness the achievements of the strong military ...... In these 10 years, the Party and the national cause of the Party has made historic achievements and historic changes, the fundamental lies in the Party to establish Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee of the core of the Party's central position, the establishment of Xi Jinping, socialist ideology of socialist characteristics of a new era of China, the guiding position. Socialist Thought for a New Era of Chinese Characteristics. The ""two establishments"" is a major political achievement of the Party in the new era, the basis of confidence in doing a good job, the greatest certainty, the greatest confidence and the greatest guarantee for overcoming all difficulties and obstacles and coping with all uncertainties, and it has a bearing on the rise and fall of the Party, the future and destiny of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the country's long-lasting peace and prosperity and the great revival of the Chinese nation. The future of socialism with Chinese characteristics is at stake. The Party, the government, the military, the people and the academia, east, west, south, north and south, the Party is the leader of everything, is the highest political leadership. Adhering to the Party's leadership is first and foremost a matter of ""two safeguards"". For the people's army, adhere to the party's absolute leadership of the army, the first is to adhere to the highest leadership and command of the army belongs to the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission. To do this, it is necessary to fully implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and the Chairman of the Military Commission will make the final decision on major issues of the military, and make the final decision. From this, we can see that the army supports the ""two establishments"" and the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission is inherently consistent, the two are united in adhering to the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee as the supreme political principle, and are united in resolutely obeying the command of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi. Therefore, the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission will ensure that the ""two establishments"" are firmly entrenched in the army, and ensure that the decisions and deployments of President Xi and the Central Military Commission are put into practice. In the construction of a strong country, national rejuvenation of the new journey, we must ""two established"" decisive significance of the profound understanding of the transformation of the ""two safeguard"", the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission of a high degree of self-consciousness, more resolute and consciously loyal to the core, embracing the core, To uphold the core, safeguard the core, defend the core, and effectively listen to President Xi's command, be responsible to President Xi, and let President Xi rest assured. How to recognize and improve the institutional mechanism for the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission? Shortly after the conclusion of the 20th Party Congress, the Central Military Commission issued several opinions on deepening the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and several provisions on the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. Subsequently, the General Office of the Central Military Commission issued a study and education plan for the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. The introduction of this series of important regulations and documents is to focus on cracking the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission in the implementation of the understanding of the grasp is not in place, the implementation of the relevant system and mechanism is not strict enough, not enough to take the initiative to act and other issues. For example, in-depth study and education on the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, to clarify the overall requirements, basic content, key tasks and organizational safeguards, and to require the classification of targeted study and education at different levels, emphasizing the importance of accurately grasping the significance of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, the important connotations and practical requirements, and to consolidate the ideological and political basis for the implementation of the implementation of the system; in order to improve the quality of the implementation of the ""Three Mechanisms In terms of improving the quality of the implementation of the ""three mechanisms"", it is required to strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reports, increase supervision and inspection, optimize information services, and clarify the relevant content, procedures and requirements, so as to ensure that President Xi has a firm grasp of the troops and efficiently commands them. If we compare a system to a complex and sophisticated machine, then a sound system is like a complete set of components, and a perfect mechanism is like a ""lubricant"" to ensure its efficient operation. To improve the system and mechanism for implementing the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission is to solidify the results of proven experience, focus on enhancing the systematic and operational nature of the relevant system and mechanism, and continuously promote the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission in accordance with the rule of law, standardization, and proceduralization. At all levels, we should take the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission as the highest political requirement to follow, as the highest political discipline to strictly abide by, strengthen the organizational leadership, refine the relevant measures, improve the quality of implementation, to ensure that the requirements of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission consistently to the end to ensure that the decision-making instructions of President Xi to the end. Why is it that the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission hinges on taking responsibility and relying on practical work? Comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission is a serious and significant political responsibility, is the common responsibility of the entire army, must correctly handle the centralized and unified leadership and the division of responsibilities at all levels of the relationship between the report must be reported to the report must be reported to the report, the responsibility of their own must be truly responsible for the good, neither exceeding the authority, but also do not shirk their responsibilities. Leaders and cadres at all levels should play a leading role in demonstrating and improving their political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, and shouldering their responsibilities, daring to take responsibility, working boldly, and forging ahead to ensure that the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission is put into practice. In May 2023, all officers and men of a naval submarine force crew received a special letter of reply. In the letter, President Xi encouraged them to bear in mind the heavy trust of the Party and the people, constantly improve the ability to fulfill their mission, and strive to forge a comprehensive and tough underwater troops, and to make greater contributions to the realization of the goal of building the army for 100 years. 10 years ago, President Xi came to the crew of the crew of the team officers and men, and had lunch with them, in-depth exchanges, and hoped that they in the wind and waves, the ocean and the ocean to sharpen their will, and thrive. 10 years, the crew of the team officers and men to bear in mind that they will be able to fulfill their mission, and to make greater contribution to the realization of the military 100 years. In the past 10 years, the officers and men of the crew team, bearing in mind the commander-in-chief's wishes, have faithfully performed their duties and responsibilities, successfully completed many major tasks such as war voyages, tests and drills, etc., and have been awarded collective first-class merit by the Central Military Commission on two successive occasions. The comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission is not an abstract principle or an empty slogan, but must be put into action, insisting that all energy is focused on the war, all work is directed to the war, and the implementation of the decisions and instructions of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi, and the effective fulfillment of the mission and tasks of the army in the new era.

发挥好院校教育人才培养主渠道作用 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：印祺 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-14 06:29:37 0,发挥好院校教育人才培养主渠道作用 ■印祺 院校教育是我军人才培养的主渠道，具有基础性、先导性、全局性作用。新时代军队院校教育要瞄准服务强国兴军，坚持用改革创新的思路和办法解决发展中的矛盾和问题，加快建设一流军事院校、培养一流军事人才，通过推动高质量发展更好地发挥人才培养主渠道作用。 进一步深化战教耦合。战教耦合是指人才培养供给侧与未来战场需求侧之间响应联动、相互作用形成的关联状态，是战训耦合要求在院校教育领域的体现和落实。院校推进战教深度耦合，本质是归正为战育人指向，解决战教脱节问题；关键是研透“耦合”的内在机理，找准“耦合”的发力重点。首先，培训需求论证要向实战聚焦。建立健全院校和部队定期会商机制、各类人才素质模型联合制定机制、毕业学员跟踪调查机制，减少人才“二次加工”，提高备战打仗人才供给的精准度。其次，课程内容设置要向实战贴近。通过解构岗位能力、映射战教关系、聚优配置课程，将部队练兵备战最新成果引入课堂，打通从院校到部队、从课堂到战场的链路。再次，组训施教方式要向实战转变。将练指挥与练技术、练“钢”与练“气”结合起来，加强技战术融合训练和实际运用，实现能力素质、武器装备与战斗精神的融合贯通。最后，保障条件建设要向实战靠拢。通过科技赋能加快发展模拟化、网络化、对抗性教学训练手段，创设实战化教学训练场景，重视教学训练数据的挖掘、积累、维护，实现演训场与未来战场有机衔接。 进一步加快“双一流”建设。军队院校要主动融入国家“双一流”建设体系，进行前瞻性、战略性、系统性思考和谋划，有组织地加强短期内有可能达到世界先进水平的一流军队院校和一流学科建设，牵引带动办学育人水平跃升。首先，要建一流学科专业。加大传统学科“军事+”“科技+”改造，重构以新兴交叉学科专业为引领、以军事应用学科专业为主干、以理工类学科专业为基础的新型学科专业体系。其次，要育一流师资队伍。下大力打造一批科学家、领军拔尖人才和创新团队，扩大选拔教员的视野、拓宽锤炼教员的路子，以懂打仗的名师带出会打仗的高徒。再次，要揽一流培养生源。将院校教育纳入军官职业化发展路径一体设计，实施刚性的院校教育培养使用制度，真正实现优秀人才优先送学、优学优用、训用一致。最后，要出一流科研成果。聚焦为人才培养和战斗力建设服务，加强有组织的科研工作，攻关一批具有标志性的军事理论成果，研发一批自主可控的先进科技成果。 进一步推进开放办学。推进开放办学，本质上是通过打造视野开阔、富有特色的开放平台，调动一切可以调动的宝贵资源、利用一切可以利用的优秀成果为人才培养服务。首先，要用好联教联训平台。盘活院校与院校、院校与部队育人资源，以教员流动实现集优培训，以学员流动实现素质全训。其次，要用好职业教育平台。全面推行院校教育预备培训制度，创新院校教育培训预备课程的内容形式，推出学习激励的管用措施，调动官兵学习内生动力。再次，要用好军地合作平台。积极融入国家教育体系“借力搭车”，拓展与地方“双一流”高校合作育人的渠道规模，遴选优秀学员到地方知名高校交流培养。 进一步创新治理模式。作为军事治理的重要组成部分，军队院校教育科学推进军事治理，要以创新治理模式、提高治理效能为切入点，把院校教育治理的目标任务、思路举措搞清楚，把院校教育治理的制度体系、运行机制搞顺畅。首先，要强化“制度之治”。统筹推进院校教育领域政策法规“立改废释”，健全以《军队院校教育条例（试行）》为总揽、规范性文件为主干、军兵种教育规章为支撑、院校实施细则为补充的法规体系。其次，要强化“专家之治”。进一步规范院校教育指导委员会以及院校各类专家组织的工作程序、内容和运行机制，统筹用好军队院校、作战部队、科研机构和训练机构等专家力量，不断提升院校教育治理的科学化专业化水平。再次，要强化“主体之治”。深化军队院校“放、管、服”改革，不断优化管理权责，扩大军种办学、院校治学自主权。健全“督导、监察、评价”体系，常态开展院校教育督导监察评价。 （作者单位：国防大学政治学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115000424/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266711.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114093825/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266711.html,2023-11-15 0:00:00,Playing the role of the main channel of education and talent cultivation in institutions Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Yinqi Editor in Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-14 06:29:37 0,"The role of the main channel of talent cultivation ■ Yinqi Institutional education is the main channel of talent cultivation in the army, with a fundamental, pioneering and overall role. In the new era, the military academy education should aim to serve the strong country and the military, adhere to the reform and innovation ideas and methods to solve the contradictions and problems in the development, accelerate the construction of first-class military academies, training first-class military talents, and better play the role of the main channel of talent training by promoting high-quality development. Further deepen the coupling of war and education. War education coupling refers to the supply side of talent training and the future battlefield demand side of the response linkage, interaction between the formation of the associated state, is the war training coupling requirements in the field of institutional education embodiment and implementation. Institutions to promote the depth of the coupling of war education, the essence of the war is to normalize the point of training for the war, to solve the problem of the disconnect between war education; the key is to study the ""coupling"" of the internal mechanism, to find the ""coupling"" of the focus of the force. First of all, the training demand argumentation to the actual combat focus. Establish and improve the institutions and troops regular consultation mechanism, various types of talent quality model joint development mechanism, graduate trainee tracking and investigation mechanism, to reduce the talent ""secondary processing"", to improve the readiness to fight the precision of the supply of talent. Secondly, the course content should be close to the actual battle. By deconstructing the post capacity, mapping the relationship between war and education, and gathering and optimizing the configuration of the curriculum, the latest achievements of troop training and preparation for war will be introduced into the classroom, opening up the chain from the institution to the troop, and from the classroom to the battlefield. Once again, the way of organizing training and teaching should be changed to actual combat. Combine the practice of command with the practice of technology, the practice of ""steel"" with the practice of ""gas"", to strengthen the integration of technical and tactical training and practical application, to achieve the integration of competence, weapons and equipment and the spirit of combat. Finally, the construction of security conditions should be close to the actual combat. Through the science and technology empowerment to accelerate the development of simulation, network, confrontational teaching and training means, the creation of real-world teaching and training scenarios, pay attention to the teaching and training data mining, accumulation, maintenance, to achieve the organic convergence of the training ground and the future battlefield. Further accelerate the ""double first-class"" construction. Military colleges and universities should take the initiative to integrate into the national ""double first-class"" construction system, forward-looking, strategic, systematic thinking and planning, organized to strengthen the short-term possibility of reaching the world's advanced level of first-class military colleges and universities and first-class disciplines construction, traction driven by the level of education and training leap. First of all, to build first-class disciplines and specialties. Increase the traditional disciplines ""military +"" ""science and technology +"" transformation, reconstruction of emerging cross-disciplinary specialties as a leader, military application of disciplines and specialties as the main backbone, based on the scientific and technological disciplines and specialties of the new disciplines and specialties system. Secondly, we should educate first-class faculty. Make great efforts to build a number of scientists, leading and outstanding talents and innovation team, expand the vision of the selection of faculty, broaden the way to refine the faculty, to understand the war master teacher to bring out the high disciples who will fight the war. Once again, it is necessary to take the first-class training source. Institutional education will be integrated into the officer's career development path as a whole design, the implementation of rigid institutional education training and use of the system, to truly realize the priority of excellent talent to send to school, excellent learning and use, training and use of the same. Finally, to produce first-class scientific research results. Focusing on the service of talent training and combat capability construction, strengthening organized scientific research, tackling a number of landmark military theoretical achievements, and developing a number of independently controllable advanced scientific and technological achievements. Further promote open schooling. To promote open schooling is essentially to mobilize all the valuable resources that can be mobilized and make use of all the excellent achievements that can be utilized to serve talent cultivation by creating an open platform with a broad vision and rich characteristics. First of all, use the platform of joint teaching and training. Institutions and colleges, institutions and troops to activate the resources of training, to mobility of instructors to achieve the set of excellent training, to mobility of students to achieve the quality of the whole training. Secondly, we should use the vocational education platform. Comprehensive implementation of institutional education and preparatory training system, innovative institutional education and training preparatory courses in the form of content, the introduction of learning incentives for the use of measures to mobilize officers and men to learn endogenous motivation. Again, to use a good military cooperation platform. Actively integrate into the national education system, ""borrowing power"", expanding the scale of channels for cooperation with local ""double first-class"" colleges and universities to educate people, and selecting outstanding students to local well-known universities for exchange and training. Further innovate the governance model. As an important part of military governance, the military colleges and universities to promote scientific military governance, to innovate the governance model, improve the effectiveness of governance as an entry point, the institutions of education and governance of the objectives and tasks, ideas and initiatives clear, the institutions of education and governance of the institutional system, the operating mechanism to get smooth. First of all, to strengthen the ""system of governance"". Coordinate the promotion of institutional education policies and regulations in the field of education ""to establish, change, abolish and interpret"", and improve the ""military colleges and universities education regulations (for trial implementation)"" as a general overview, normative documents as the main trunk, military and military education regulations as the support of the implementation of the rules of the institutions as a supplement to the regulatory system. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the ""rule of experts"". Further standardize the work procedures, contents and operation mechanism of the education steering committee and various expert organizations of institutions, make good use of the expert power of military colleges and universities, combat troops, scientific research institutes and training institutes, and continuously improve the scientific and professional level of education governance of institutions. Again, to strengthen the ""main body of governance"". Deepen the ""release, management, service"" reform of military colleges and universities, constantly optimize the management authority and responsibility, and expand the autonomy of the military branches to run schools and institutions to govern. Improve the ""supervision, monitoring and evaluation"" system, and carry out regular supervision and evaluation of institutional education. (Author's unit: School of Political Science, National Defense University)","In the military academy education, the role of the main channel of talent cultivation is to serve the strong country and the military, adhere to the reform and innovation ideas and methods to solve the contradictions and problems in the development, accelerate the construction of first-class military academies, training first-class military talents, and better play the role of the main channel of talent training by promoting high-quality development.

严肃认真对待和准备战争，防止陷入“达克效应”而难以自知 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：西成  闻洛屏 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-14 06:28:11 0,警惕军事上的“达克效应” ■张西成  闻洛屏 简单而言，“达克效应”是一种认知偏差，指的是能力不足的人在自己欠考虑的情况下得出错误的结论，却无法正确认识到自身的不足，导致他们往往无法客观评价自己和他人的能力水平。 “达克效应”在现实中普遍存在。有一组统计数据说，无论大学教授还是一般产业工人，绝大部分人都认为自己的能力和表现要超过同行业的平均水平。而且，如果让公司里每个人谈一谈自己对公司成功所作贡献的占比，加起来会超过300%。这种自我高估的“达克效应”，在军事领域也不乏其例。 滑铁卢之战前夕，拿破仑一度自信满满。在一次早餐会上，他兴高采烈地对部属讲：“我们获胜的机会至少是90%，而失败的可能性不到10%。”在拿破仑眼里，威灵顿的杂牌军队不堪一击，一拳就可以将其打翻在地。结果滑铁卢之战，拿破仑不仅输掉了战役，也输掉了整个帝国。 解放前，国民党发动内战时，曾做过战略评估。在对双方军队规模、装备水平、经济基础等方面进行比较后，陈诚给出的判断是国民党军占据绝对优势，3~6个月即可解决内战问题，而何应钦的评估是需要2~3年。蒋介石选择了陈诚的判断。3年之后，国民党军被赶到了台湾。 历史事实就是这样：战争，往往在你猝不及防的时候突然爆发；失败，常常在你自我感觉很好的时候突然降临。“达克效应”提醒人们，永远不要过高估计自己的能力，永远不要过低估计对手的智商，永远不要产生那种一切尽在掌控之中的幻觉。 孙子曰：“不尽知用兵之害者，则不能尽知用兵之利也。”过于乐观是人类的通病，认知偏差是人性的弱点。二者叠加起来的结果，往往会让人首先看到有利的、可行的方面，因而被貌似辉煌的前景所吸引，却忽略了那些被动的、不可行的因素。 毛泽东同志曾说过：“必须预计到最困难最危险最黑暗的种种可能情况，并从这点出发去克服困难，争取光明与胜利的局面。”与过去相比，将来与强敌对手过招，其残酷性、复杂性、不可预见性愈发突出，尤其需要我们更加严肃认真地对待和准备战争，尤其需要防止陷入“达克效应”而难以自知。 要牢记“骄兵必败，忘战必危”的古训。始终谨记“山外有山、人外有人”，少自满、勿懈怠。要知道，操场上同自己人比武与战场上同敌人比拼不是一回事，要清醒看到对手的强项和弱点，既不能畏战怯敌，也不能骄傲轻敌。 要汲取“知人者智，自知者明”的智慧。俗话说，人贵有自知之明。自知之明之所以贵，贵在其难。知己不深、知己不全、知己不准，乃用兵之大忌。未来战场上最可怕的，不是对手有多强大，而是对手比你还了解你自己。 要保持“不怕一万，就怕万一”的警醒。“夫惟无虑而易敌者，必擒于人。”将来走上战场和对手较量，越是不可想象之事越有可能发生，因而要强化底线思维、极限思维，力求把制敌的“绝招”与“备招”设足，把防范的“一万”与“万一”想全。切莫因自己的颟顸自大、粗心疏忽，而给对手以可乘之机。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115000424/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266710.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114094016/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266710.html,2023-11-15 0:00:00,"Treating and Preparing for War Seriously, Preventing the ""Ducker Effect"" and Being Unaware of It Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Xicheng Wen Luoping Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-14 06:28:11 0","■Watch out for the ""Ducker Effect"" in the military ■ Zhang Xicheng Wen Luoping Simply put, the ""Ducker Effect"" is a kind of cognitive bias, which refers to the fact that people with insufficient ability come to wrong conclusions in their own poorly thought-out situations, but are unable to correctly recognize their own inadequacies, resulting in the fact that they are often unable to objectively evaluate their own and others' ability levels. They are often unable to objectively assess their own level of competence and that of others. The ""Ducker effect"" is prevalent in reality. There is a set of statistics which says that no matter whether they are university professors or general industrial workers, the vast majority of them think that their ability and performance are above the average level of their industry. Moreover, if you ask each person in a company to talk about his or her contribution to the company's success, it adds up to more than 300%. This self-overestimation of the ""Ducker effect"" is not uncommon in the military field. On the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon was confident. At a breakfast meeting, he cheerfully told his subordinates: ""Our chances of winning are at least 90%, while the possibility of failure is less than 10%."" In Napoleon's eyes, Wellington's motley army was unbeatable and could be knocked to the ground with a single punch. As a result of the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon not only lost the battle, but also the whole empire. Before liberation, when the Kuomintang started the civil war, it had made a strategic assessment. After comparing the size of the armies of both sides, the level of equipment, and the economic base, Chen Cheng gave the judgment that the Kuomintang army had an absolute advantage and the civil war could be resolved in 3 to 6 months, while He Yingqin's assessment was that it would take 2 to 3 years. Chiang Kai-shek chose Chen Cheng's judgment. 3 years later, the Kuomintang army was driven to Taiwan. This is the fact of history: war often breaks out when you are caught off guard; failure often comes when you feel good about yourself. The ""Dak effect"" reminds people to never overestimate their own ability, never underestimate the opponent's IQ, and never create the illusion that everything is under control. Sun Tzu said: ""If you don't know the harm of using military force, you can't know the benefit of using military force."" Over-optimism is a common human problem, and cognitive bias is a human weakness. The result of the two superimposed on each other tends to make people first see the favorable and feasible aspects, and thus be attracted by the seemingly brilliant prospects, while ignoring the passive and unfeasible factors. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, ""One must anticipate the most difficult, the most dangerous and the darkest of all possible scenarios, and from that point go on to overcome the difficulties and strive for a bright and victorious situation."" Compared with the past, in the future with strong opponents, the cruelty, complexity, unpredictability is more and more prominent, especially need to treat and prepare for war more seriously, especially need to prevent falling into the ""Dak effect"" and difficult to know. We must remember the old adage that ""arrogance will lead to defeat and forgetting war will lead to danger"". Always keep in mind that ""there are mountains beyond the mountains, people beyond people"", less complacent, do not slack off. We must know that the playground with their own people and the battlefield with the enemy is not the same thing, we must be clear to see the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, neither fear of war and cowardice, but also can not be proud of the enemy. To draw on the wisdom of ""knowing others, self-knowledge"". As the saying goes, it is important to have self-knowledge. The reason why self-knowledge is expensive is that it is difficult. Know yourself is not deep, know yourself is not complete, know yourself is not allowed, is the army of the taboo. The most frightening thing on the future battlefield is not how powerful the opponent is, but the opponent knows you better than you know yourself. To maintain ""not afraid of 10,000, just afraid of what if"" vigilance. ""The one who is not afraid of the enemy will be captured."" In the future on the battlefield and rivalry, the more unimaginable things are more likely to happen, and therefore to strengthen the bottom line thinking, limit thinking, and strive to check the enemy's ""masterstroke"" and ""preparedness"" to set up enough to guard against the ""10,000 ""and"" in case ""to think of all. Do not because of their own dawdling arrogance, careless negligence, and give the opponent to take advantage of the opportunity.","The article discusses the ""Ducker Effect"", a cognitive bias that prevents people from objectively assessing their own abilities or the abilities of others. It warns against the dangers of self-overestimation, particularly in the military field. The article uses historical examples to illustrate how misjudgments can lead to disastrous outcomes, such as Napoleon's underestimation of Wellington's army and the Kuomintang's overestimation of its own abilities during the civil war. The article emphasizes the importance of being aware of the ""Ducker Effect"", self-knowledge, and vigilance in preparing for and treating war seriously, as well as the need to anticipate and prepare for the unpredictable and difficult aspects of warfare."
探寻中国兵法致胜之道丨中国传统战略的精髓要义 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：吴如嵩  郝敬东 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-14 06:24:58 0,中国传统战略的精髓要义 ■吴如嵩  郝敬东 编者按 中国传统战略是几千年来军事实践经验的规律性总结和兵家群体智慧的结晶。它是中华优秀传统文化的重要组成部分，是中国历代军事思想的主体和精华，也是人类社会璀璨的文化瑰宝。今天，认真回顾中国传统战略的精髓要义，更好地发掘蕴含其中的时代价值，推动其创造性转化、创新性发展，对于丰富发展我们党军事斗争指挥艺术具有重要的借鉴启示。 深刻认识中国传统战略的价值意义 中国传统战略，源自于中华优秀传统文化，根植于几千年来军事实践经验，是时代精华和民族瑰宝，对于军事斗争战略指导具有重要价值意义。 源自于中华优秀传统文化，是人类社会璀璨的文化瑰宝。中国传统战略的发展不是孤立的社会现象，而是根植于深厚的历史文化沃土；反过来，中华传统文化也对军事战略产生深刻影响，给其打上了独特的文化烙印。如中国历史上长期占主导地位的农耕自然经济社会结构，形成了安土重迁、追求稳定的文化心理和热爱和平、内向持重的民族性格。在这种文化氛围中形成的军事战略，自然是防御先于进攻、守土重于拓疆、同化优于分异、重谋贵于尚战。可以说，中国传统战略具有历史文化的延续性和传承性，是中国乃至世界文明宝库中的珍贵遗产。 根植于几千年军事实践经验，是中国兵家群体智慧的结晶。战争实践是影响军事战略形成和发展的最为重要的条件。中国历史上谋求中华民族统一、农民起义、抗击外敌入侵等战争，次数频繁、规模巨大，斗争激烈、形式多样，是中国传统战略形成的源泉和发展的动力。同时，中国古代兵家又将这些经验教训上升到理论高度，形成了具有独特优势的中国传统战略思想。可以说，中国传统战略是在几千年来军事实践经验的基础上产生并且只能在这个基础上产生，是当时兵家正确反映战争运动的知识经验的结晶，曾对各个时期的军事实践起过重要指导作用，而且成为今天中国战略家的大智慧，体现了中华民族强大的思维能力和精神力量。虽然它们属于过去，但是其中饱含智慧的闪光点也同样属于现在和未来。 发展于中国革命战争，对军事斗争具有重要启迪和借鉴。我党我军在长期革命战争中，根据需要，不断汲取中国历代军事战略精华；反过来，中国传统战略也获得丰富和发展，二者浑然一体，别具特色。如十大军事原则中先打分散和孤立之敌、每战集中绝对优势兵力、不打无准备无把握之仗等，都体现了我国古代兵法中“避实击虚”“我专敌分”“先胜后战”等优秀的传统战略思想。可以说，我党我军的战略思想继承了中华民族军事战略的优秀遗产，与源远流长的中国传统战略一脉相承。今天，国家安全面临的威胁挑战不容忽视，战争风险仍然存在，应该从中国传统战略这份极为宝贵的历史遗产中汲取精华，为丰富发展我们党军事斗争指挥艺术提供有益启示。 区别于侵略他人、称霸世界，有利于促进世界和平与发展。中国传统战略强调防御、自卫、后发制人，崇尚的是道胜、义胜、谋胜，反对的是以大欺小、恃强凌弱、武力称霸。和平、和睦、和谐的追求深深根植于中华民族的精神世界之中，融入了中国人民的血脉之中。中国在15世纪就拥有了先进的航海技术，郑和下西洋却没有像西方国家那样依靠坚船利炮四处掠夺。可以说，中华民族的血液里没有侵略他人、称霸世界的基因。中国决不走西方一些国家追逐霸权、“国强必霸”的老路，相反，中国已成为促进世界和平与发展不可或缺的重要力量。正如习主席向世界宣告的，“中国这头狮子已经醒了，但这是一只和平的、可亲的、文明的狮子”。 准确把握中国传统战略的核心精神 中国传统战略，几千年来并不是一成不变的，它总是随着时代发展而不断地被人们扬弃和传承。但是，它那占主导地位的军事战略主旨自古至今并没有太多变化，它集中体现为以柔克刚、自卫后发的积极防御战略。 后发制人。严守自卫立场、坚持后发制人，而不是为了挑起战争、侵略扩张的积极防御战略，一直是中国几千年来传统战略的核心。如《老子》说“吾不敢为主，而为客；不敢进寸，而退尺”，《孙子兵法》讲“先为不可胜，以待敌之可胜”。历史上的齐鲁长勺之战，鲁庄公采取曹刿“彼竭我盈，故克之”的建议，大败齐军；晋楚城濮之战，晋文公“退避三舍”，避强楚锋芒，大败楚军，都是先让一步、后发制人，因而取胜的。当然，后发制人并不排斥先机制敌，一旦受到侵犯，将迅速反应、反击制胜。如同水一样，表面上温和、平缓，但需要时，可以变成无比坚硬的冰山、千里冰封的雪海，所谓“激水之疾，至于漂石者”，能柔能刚、能屈能伸。可以说，后发制人是中华民族几千年来的哲学根基。这就是毛泽东同志所说的：“人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。” 守柔韬晦。中国历史上弱者同强者的斗争，开始阶段都柔如春草，为保存实力，待机胜敌，往往采取守柔、韬晦之策，这是中国传统战略的要求。如《老子》说“守柔曰强”“圣人终不为大，故能成其大”，《列子》讲“天下有常胜之道，有不常胜之道。常胜之道曰柔，常不胜之道曰强”，成为一条以弱胜强、以柔克刚的规律性认识和战略性策略。吕尚辅佐周族灭商，对文王说：“鸷鸟将击，卑飞敛翼；猛兽将搏，弭耳俯伏；圣人将动，必有愚色”；范蠡协助越王勾践灭吴，“十年生聚，十年教训”，终于以一个弱国打败了强大的吴国，都充分体现了隐忍静柔的战略策略思想，成为中国传统战略的基本原则。 富国强兵。“犁与剑”是一个古老命题，“犁”象征经济建设，“剑”象征军事发展。对一个国家而言，二者如车之两轮、鸟之双翼，地位不言而喻。立足于富国与强兵相统一，凝聚着中华民族的风雨沧桑和智慧力量，这是中国传统战略的基础。如《论语》讲“足食，足兵，民信之矣”，《管子》说“甲兵之本，必先于田宅”。即在重农的基础上富国，在富国的基础上强兵，这一传统历经数千年，是一以贯之的军事战略，也是努力追求的目标。需要指出的是，中国传统战略虽然是防御的，但防御要以军事力量为基础。这种战略思想具有鲜明的中华民族特色。总之，高超的战略艺术和坚实的综合国力，构成了中国传统战略的两翼，二者缺一不可。 因敌制胜。中国历代军事战略要求一切从实际出发，以时间、地点、兵力和条件为转移，扬长避短、趋利避害，灵活用兵、因敌制胜，这是中国传统战略的关键。如《尉缭子》说“正兵贵先，奇兵贵后，或先或后，制敌者也”，《孙子兵法》讲“兵无常势，水无常形，能因敌变化而取胜者，谓之神”。楚汉之争时，韩信三次江河作战，用了三个不同战法：第一次，针对魏王豹兵力过于集中，声东击西、攻其不守；第二次，针对赵将陈余轻敌心理，奇正并用、反常用兵；第三次，针对楚将龙且急于求战，诱敌追击、半渡阻击，真正做到了“践墨随敌，以决战事”。可以说，“兵因敌而制胜”的灵活自主作战，是中国传统战略实用理性的集中体现。 推动中国传统战略的创造性转化、创新性发展 继承和弘扬中国传统战略，要按照时代特点和要求，把握科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，赋予其新的时代内涵和表达形式，推动转化发展，激发其生命力，增强其影响力和感召力。 坚持和运用辩证唯物主义世界观和方法论。学好用好马克思主义哲学，一直是我党的优秀传统，是中国共产党的思想优势和政治优势。未来战争智能化程度不断提高，制胜观念、制胜要素、制胜方式发生重大变化，使战略认识领域充满了迷雾。而要穿透战争迷雾，从中国传统战略中汲取智慧和养分，仅靠我们平常的眼力是不够的，必须借助唯物辩证法这个“望远镜”和“显微镜”。坚持发展地而不是静止地、全面地而不是片面地、系统地而不是零散地、普遍联系地而不是单一孤立地挖掘和汲取中国传统战略精华，处理好古与今、史与略、条与块、研与用的关系。这就是习主席指出的：“坚持古为今用、推陈出新，把马克思主义思想精髓同中华优秀传统文化精华贯通起来”。 坚持兵民是胜利之本。人民是历史的创造者，是历史发展的真正推动力。人民战争是推动中国传统战略转化发展的坚实基础。要把握新的时代条件下中国传统战略和人民战争的新特点，找准契合点，探索新方法、运用新方式、创新新途径，为更好继承和弘扬中国传统战略发挥好人民战争的整体威力。江山就是人民，人民就是江山。只要充分地动员人民、依靠人民，创新发展中国传统战略就有了无穷无尽的力量源泉；如果离开了人民，就成了无源之水、无本之木。这就是习主席强调的：“只要始终站在人民立场上，赢得最广大人民衷心拥护，就能构筑起众志成城的铜墙铁壁。” 坚持自信自立。鞋子合不合脚，只有穿的人才知道。中国传统战略开拓于几千年的军事实践经验，深深扎根于中华大地，具有无比深厚的历史底蕴，好不好、行不行，中国人民最清楚，也最有发言权。可以说，独特的文化传统，独特的历史命运，独特的基本国情，形成了具有独特优势的中国传统战略，注定了我们必然要坚定不移坚持适合自己特点的战略。无论遇到什么风浪，都要有定力、有主见，真正做到“千磨万击还坚劲，任尔东西南北风”。这就是习主席指出的：“坚持积极防御，是总结历史经验、科学判断现实和未来得出来的结论，决不是权宜之计，要牢牢坚持住。” 坚持守正创新。世界上没有放之四海而皆准的战略，也没有一成不变的战略。历史传统是一把双刃剑，既有精华也有糟粕，不是“照搬”就行，也不是略加“现代化”的解释就成了强军胜战的良方。历史提供给我们的只是启迪和借鉴，而不是现成的答案。守正，就是运用马克思主义立场观点方法，挖掘和汲取中国传统战略精华，守住本和源、根和魂；创新，就是根据时代条件、立足中国国情，在这个基础上发展中国传统战略，与时俱进，推陈出新。守正是创新的前提和基础，创新是守正的目的和路径。这就是习主席强调的：“我们从事的是前无古人的伟大事业，守正才能不迷失方向、不犯颠覆性错误，创新才能把握时代、引领时代。”,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115000424/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266709.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114094157/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266709.html,2023-11-15 0:00:00,Exploring the Way to Victory in Chinese Art of War丨The Essence of Traditional Chinese Strategy Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Wu Rusong Hao Jingdong Responsibility: Yixi Ram 2023-11-14 06:24:58 0,"The Essence of Chinese Traditional Strategy ■ Wu Rusong Hao Jingdong Editor's Note Chinese traditional strategy is a regular summary of thousands of years of military practical experience and the crystallization of the wisdom of the military community. It is an important part of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, is the main body and essence of Chinese military thought of all times, and is also a bright cultural treasure of human society. Today, seriously reviewing the essence of traditional Chinese strategy, better exploring the value of the times contained therein, and promoting its creative transformation and innovative development, is an important source of inspiration for enriching the development of our Party's art of commanding military struggles. A deep understanding of the value and significance of traditional Chinese strategy Traditional Chinese strategy, originating from the excellent traditional Chinese culture, rooted in thousands of years of military practical experience, is the essence of the times and national treasure, for the strategic guidance of the military struggle has an important value and significance. Chinese traditional strategy, which originates from the excellent traditional Chinese culture, is a bright cultural treasure of human society. The development of Chinese traditional strategy is not an isolated social phenomenon, but is rooted in the deep historical and cultural fertile ground; in turn, Chinese traditional culture also has a profound impact on military strategy, giving it a unique cultural imprint. For example, China's long history of dominant natural economic and social structure of farming, the formation of a peaceful, the pursuit of stability in the cultural psychology and love of peace, introverted national character. The military strategy formed in this cultural atmosphere is naturally more defensive than offensive, more important than expanding the territory, better than assimilating the differences, and more strategic than the war. It can be said that traditional Chinese strategy has historical and cultural continuity and inheritance, and is a precious heritage in the treasury of Chinese and even world civilization. Rooted in thousands of years of practical military experience, it is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese military community. War practice is the most important condition affecting the formation and development of military strategy. Chinese history, seeking unity of the Chinese nation, peasant uprisings, resistance to foreign invasions and other wars, the number of frequent, large-scale, intense struggle, a variety of forms, is the source of the formation of traditional Chinese strategy and the development of the driving force. At the same time, ancient Chinese military scientists raised these lessons to a theoretical level, forming the traditional Chinese strategic thought with unique advantages. It can be said that the traditional Chinese strategy is produced and can only be produced on the basis of thousands of years of practical military experience, and is the crystallization of the knowledge and experience of the soldiers of that time which correctly reflects the war movement, and has played an important guiding role in the military practice of each period, and has become the great wisdom of today's Chinese strategists, which embodies the powerful thinking ability and spiritual strength of the Chinese nation. Although they belong to the past, the flashes of wisdom in them also belong to the present and the future. Developed in the Chinese Revolutionary War, it is an important inspiration and reference for the military struggle. Our Party and our army in the long-term revolutionary war, according to the need, and constantly draw on the essence of the Chinese military strategy of the past generations; in turn, the Chinese traditional strategy has been enriched and developed, the two are a blend of one, distinctive. For example, the ten military principles of fighting the scattered and isolated enemy first, concentrating the absolute superiority of forces in every battle, and not fighting unprepared and unsure battles, etc., all reflect China's ancient art of war, ""avoiding the real and striking at the virtual,"" ""I specialize in the enemy's division,"" ""win first and then fight. ""and other excellent traditional strategic thinking. It can be said that the strategic thinking of our Party and our army has inherited the excellent legacy of Chinese military strategy, and is in line with the traditional Chinese strategy that has a long history. Today, the threats and challenges to national security cannot be ignored, and the risk of war still exists, so we should draw on the essence of this extremely valuable historical heritage of traditional Chinese strategy to provide useful insights for the rich development of the Party's art of commanding military struggles. It is distinguished from aggression against others and world domination, and is conducive to the promotion of world peace and development. Traditional Chinese strategy emphasizes defense, self-defense, and pre-emptive action, and advocates victory in the way, righteousness, and strategy, while opposing bullying the small, bullying the weak, and dominating the world by force. The pursuit of peace, harmony and concord is deeply rooted in the spiritual world of the Chinese nation and has been integrated into the bloodline of the Chinese people. China in the 15th century has advanced navigation technology, Zheng He went to the West, but did not rely on the Western countries like the sharpshooters around the plunder. It can be said that the Chinese people do not have the gene of aggression and world domination in their blood. China will never follow the old path of some Western countries pursuing hegemony and ""a strong country must be hegemonic""; on the contrary, China has become an indispensable and important force for world peace and development. As President Xi has declared to the world, ""The lion of China has awakened, but it is a peaceful, friendly and civilized lion"". Accurately Grasp the Core Spirit of China's Traditional Strategy China's traditional strategy, which has not remained unchanged for thousands of years, has always been discarded and inherited with the development of the times. However, it is that the dominant military strategic thrust since ancient times has not changed much, it is concentrated in the soft to overcome the hard, self-defense after the active defense strategy. Post-emptive. The active defense strategy of strictly adhering to the position of self-defense and insisting on the latter, rather than provoking war and aggression, has been the core of China's traditional strategy for thousands of years. For example, Lao Tzu says, ""I dare not be a host, but a guest; I dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot"", and Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" says, ""The first to be invincible, in order to wait for the enemy's winnability"". Historically, the battle of Qilu long spoon, Lu Zhuang Gong to take Cao Yu ""exhaustion of my surplus, so K's"" proposal, defeated the Qi army; Jin Chu Cheng Pu battle, Jin Wengong ""retreat three sheds"", to avoid the strong Chu sharpness, defeated the Chu army, are the first step to let a step, and thus win! The first step was to give way first, and the latter was to win. Of course, the latter does not exclude the first mechanism of the enemy, once violated, will quickly react and counterattack to win. Like water, on the surface of the mild, gentle, but when needed, can become an incomparable hard icebergs, thousands of miles of frozen snow sea, the so-called ""water of the fast, to the drifting stone"", can be soft, can be rigid, can bend and can stretch. It can be said that the latter is the philosophical foundation of the Chinese nation for thousands of years. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong said: ""If people don't offend me, I won't offend them; if people offend me, I will offend them."" Keep soft and bide your time. In the struggle between the weak and the strong in Chinese history, the beginning stage is as soft as spring grass, in order to save strength and wait for the opportunity to win the enemy, they often adopt the strategy of keeping soft and biding their time, which is the requirement of the traditional Chinese strategy. Such as ""Laozi"" said ""keep soft said strong"" ""the saint is not big, so can become its big"", ""Liezi"" said ""the world has the way to always win, there is not always win the way. The way of constant victory is said to be soft, often do not win the way is said to be strong"", become a weak to win strong, soft to overcome the regularity of understanding and strategic strategy. Lu Shang assisted the Zhou tribe to destroy the Shang, said to the king of Wen: ""birds of prey will strike, mean fly convergence wing; beasts will fight, repress the ear and crouch down; saints will move, there will be stupid color""; Fan Li assisted King Goujian to destroy the Wu, ""ten years of life gathered, ten years of lessons"", finally a weak country to defeat the powerful Wu, all fully embodied the strategic strategy of patience, quietness and softness, which has become the basic principle of traditional Chinese strategy. The idea of a rich state and a strong army is fully embodied in the traditional Chinese strategy. The ""plow and the sword"" is an ancient proposition, with the ""plow"" symbolizing economic construction and the ""sword"" symbolizing military development. For a country, they are like the two wheels of a car and the two wings of a bird, and their status is self-evident. Based on the unity of the rich country and strong military, cohesion of the Chinese nation's wind and rain and wisdom and strength, which is the basis of the traditional Chinese strategy. Such as the Analects of Confucius, ""enough food, enough soldiers, the people believe that carry on"", ""Guanzi"" said ""armor and soldiers of this, must be preceded by the field and house"". That is, on the basis of heavy agriculture on the basis of rich country, on the basis of rich country strong military, this tradition has been thousands of years, is a consistent military strategy, but also efforts to pursue the goal. It should be pointed out that although the traditional Chinese strategy is defensive, the defense should be based on military power. This kind of strategic thinking has distinctive characteristics of the Chinese nation. In short, superior strategic art and solid comprehensive national strength constitute the two wings of traditional Chinese strategy, and one cannot be achieved without the other. Winning because of the enemy. Chinese military strategy through the ages requires that everything from the actual start, to time, place, strength and conditions for the transfer, to avoid the shortcomings of the strengths, tend to benefit and avoid harm, flexible use of force, due to the enemy to win, which is the key to the traditional Chinese strategy. For example, ""Yuliao Zi"" said that ""the correct military first, the odd military after the first or second, the enemy is also"", ""Sun Tzu The Art of War"" said that ""the military is not always, the water is not always shape, can win because of changes in the enemy, is called God"". During the battle of Chu and Han, Han Xin fought three times on the river, using three different methods of warfare: the first time, against the Wei King Pao's troops were too concentrated, east to west, attacking his non-defense; the second time, against the Zhao General Chen Yu's gullible mentality, odd and positive and counter-intuitive use of force; the third time, against the Chu General Long and anxious to fight, luring the enemy to chase, half of the ferry to block the attack, and truly ""trample the ink to follow the enemy to determine the matter of the war! ""The third time, in response to the Chu general Long and's eagerness to fight, he induced the enemy to pursue him and blocked his attack. It can be said that the flexible and autonomous combat of ""soldiers winning because of the enemy"" is a concentrated manifestation of the practical rationality of traditional Chinese strategy. Promote the Creative Transformation and Innovative Development of Traditional Chinese Strategy To inherit and carry forward traditional Chinese strategy, it is necessary to grasp the changes in science and technology, war, and opponents in accordance with the characteristics and requirements of the times, to give it new connotations and forms of expression, to promote the transformation and development, to stimulate its vitality, and to enhance its influence and appeal. Adhere to and utilize the worldview and methodology of dialectical materialism. Learning and utilizing Marxist philosophy has always been the excellent tradition of our party, and is the ideological and political advantage of the CPC. The increasing degree of intelligence in future wars and the significant changes in the concept of victory, elements of victory, and ways of victory have made the field of strategic understanding full of fog. To penetrate the fog of war and draw wisdom and nutrients from traditional Chinese strategy, it is not enough to rely on our ordinary eyesight, but we must make use of the ""telescope"" and ""microscope"" of materialistic dialectics. We must use the ""telescope"" and ""microscope"" of materialistic dialectics to dig out and learn the essence of traditional Chinese strategies in a developmental rather than static, comprehensive rather than one-sided, systematic rather than fragmented, and universally related rather than single and isolated way, and to deal with the relationship between the ancient and the modern, the historical and the sketchy, the stripes and the blocks, and the research and the use. This is what President Xi pointed out: ""Adhere to the use of the past for the present, promote innovation, and connect the essence of Marxist thought with the essence of excellent traditional Chinese culture."" Insist that the people and the army are the basis of victory. The people are the creators of history and the real driving force of historical development. People's war is a solid foundation for promoting the transformation and development of traditional Chinese strategy. We should grasp the new characteristics of Chinese traditional strategy and people's war under the new conditions of the times, identify the point of convergence, explore new methods, apply new ways, and innovate new ways, in order to better inherit and carry forward the Chinese traditional strategy and give full play to the overall power of people's war. The river and the mountain are the people, and the people are the river and the mountain. As long as the people are fully mobilized and relied upon, the innovation and development of traditional Chinese strategy will have an endless source of strength; if it leaves the people, it will become water without a source and wood without a root. This is what President Xi emphasized, ""As long as we always stand on the people's side and win the heartfelt support of the broadest number of people, we can build a bronze wall of unity."" Insist on self-confidence and self-reliance. Only the person who wears the shoes knows whether they fit or not. Chinese traditional strategy pioneered in thousands of years of practical military experience, deeply rooted in the Chinese earth, with an incomparably deep historical heritage, good or bad, whether it works or not, the Chinese people are the most clear, but also the most right to speak. It can be said that the unique cultural tradition, unique historical destiny, unique basic national conditions, formed a unique advantage of the Chinese traditional strategy, destined to unswervingly adhere to our own characteristics of the strategy. No matter what storms and waves we encounter, we must be determined and assertive, and truly realize that ""a thousand blows are still strong, and the winds blow from east to west and from south to north"". This is what President Xi pointed out: ""adhere to the active defense, is to sum up the historical experience, scientific judgment of reality and the future of the conclusion reached, is never an expedient, to firmly adhere to."" Insist on guarding positive innovation. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy in the world, nor is there a strategy that remains unchanged. Historical tradition is a double-edged sword, both the essence and the dregs, not ""copy"" on the line, not a little ""modernized"" interpretation has become a strong military victory recipe. History provides us with inspiration and reference, not ready-made answers. To keep the correctness is to use Marxist position and viewpoints to dig out and learn the essence of traditional Chinese strategy, and to keep the origin, root and soul; to innovate is to develop traditional Chinese strategy on the basis of the conditions of the times and China's national conditions, and to keep abreast of the times and to push forward with new ideas. Conservation is the premise and foundation of innovation, and innovation is the purpose and path of conservation. This is what President Xi emphasized: ""We are engaged in a great cause that no one has ever done before; it is only by keeping the right course that we will not lose our way or make subversive mistakes, and it is only by innovating that we will be able to grasp the times and lead the way.""","The article explores the essence of traditional Chinese strategy and its relevance in the current era.

在新的历史起点上担负起新的文化使命 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：彭春淋 王强 刘光明 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-13 06:08:49 0,在新的历史起点上担负起新的文化使命 ■国防大学习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心 国家之魂，文以化之，文以铸之。习主席对全国宣传思想文化工作作出重要指示强调，围绕在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明这一新的文化使命，坚定文化自信，秉持开放包容，坚持守正创新。这一重要指示，明确了担负起新的文化使命的原则要求和实践路径，为我们做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作提供了根本遵循。 一 宣传思想文化工作事关党的前途命运，事关国家长治久安，事关民族凝聚力和向心力，是一项极端重要的工作。习主席提出并明确“新的文化使命”这一重大命题，必将从精神文化上凝聚起全党全军全国各族人民的磅礴力量，为全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴提供坚强思想保证、强大精神力量、有利文化条件。 唯有在精神上站得住、站得稳，一个民族才能在历史洪流中屹立不倒、挺立潮头。共同的思想基础、精神意志和文化追求，是一个党、一个国家、一个民族赖以存在和发展的文化基石和精神纽带。那些走向动荡、趋于分裂，乃至最终分崩离析的政党、社会和国家，大都有着缺乏共同文化基石的深刻教训。在几千年的历史流变中，中华民族遇到了无数艰难困苦，但都挺过来、走过来了，其中一个很重要的原因就是培育和发展了独具特色、博大精深的中华文化，为中华民族克服困难、生生不息提供了强大精神支撑。用“新的文化使命”为国家立心、为民族立魂，就能使全体人民在理想信念、价值理念、道德观念上紧紧团结在一起，成为推进强国建设、民族复兴的思想共同体、情感共同体，凝聚起团结奋斗、自强不息的精神力量。 党的二十大擘画了全面建设社会主义现代化国家、以中国式现代化全面推进中华民族伟大复兴的宏伟蓝图。中国式现代化是物质文明和精神文明相协调的现代化，深深植根于中华优秀传统文化，是一种全新的人类文明形态。中华民族现代文明是在推进中国式现代化的过程中形成的，是中国式现代化的文化形态，是经由“两个结合”特别是第二个结合形成的有机统一的新的文化生命体。用“新的文化使命”引领中国精神、汇聚中国力量，就能进一步推动伟大社会革命，筑牢“中国式现代化赋予中华文明以现代力量，中华文明赋予中国式现代化以深厚底蕴”的道路根基。 二 党的十八大以来，习主席反复强调坚定文化自信，指出“坚定文化自信，就是坚持走自己的路”，特别是把文化自信与道路自信、理论自信、制度自信并列起来，把全党全军全国各族人民对中国特色社会主义的自信提升到前所未有的高度，极大增强了做中国人的志气、骨气、底气。 文化兴则国运兴，文化强则民族强。没有高度的文化自信，不可能有中华民族伟大复兴。我们今天所走的中国特色社会主义道路，是与五千多年中华文明分不开的。中华文明是世界上唯一绵延不断并以国家形态发展至今的伟大文明，中华优秀传统文化的丰富宇宙观、天下观、社会观、道德观等，已经内化在中国特色社会主义的道路、理论和制度之中，并焕发出持久的精神魅力与文化光辉。坚定文化自信，就能进一步坚持中国人民在创造中国历史中的主体地位，就能坚持中华民族的文化主体性，就有了无比广阔的舞台、无比深厚的历史底蕴、无比强大的前进定力。 贯穿我们党百余年奋斗历程的一个基本点，就是中国的问题必须从中国基本国情出发，由中国人自己来解答。坚定文化自信，就是要立足中华民族伟大历史实践和当代实践，用中国道理总结好中国经验，把中国经验提升为中国理论，既不盲从各种教条，也不照搬外国理论，实现精神上的独立自主。要善于从中华民族世世代代形成和积累的优秀传统文化中汲取营养和智慧，延续文化基因，萃取思想精华，展现精神魅力，保持对自身文化理想、文化价值的高度信心，保持对自身文化生命力、创造力的高度信心。要把文化自信融入全民族的精神气质与文化品格中，不崇洋媚外也不极端排外，养成昂扬向上的风貌和理性平和的心态，以崭新的面貌、自信的步伐迈向未来。 三 进入新时代，习主席就秉持开放包容作出一系列重要论断，提出“对待不同文明，我们需要比天空更宽阔的胸怀”，强调“更加广泛地开展同各国的文化交流，更加积极主动地学习借鉴世界一切优秀文明成果”，真诚呼吁世界各国“践行全球文明倡议，为推动构建人类命运共同体注入深厚持久的文化力量”。这些精辟论述，为我们深化交流互鉴、讲好中国故事、传播好中国声音明晰了方向。 中华文明的博大气象，得益于中华文化自古以来开放的姿态、包容的胸怀。在文化传承发展座谈会上，习主席深刻指出：“中华文明具有突出的包容性，从根本上决定了中华民族交往交流交融的历史取向，决定了中国各宗教信仰多元并存的和谐格局，决定了中华文化对世界文明兼收并蓄的开放胸怀。”从物种、技术，到资源、人群，再到思想、文化，中华文明正是在不断传播、交流、互动中得以发展、得以进步的。秉持开放包容，以文明交流超越文明隔阂、文明互鉴超越文明冲突、文明共存超越文明优越，我们就能在开放包容中涵养中华文明，不断铸就中华文化新辉煌。 世界文明历史揭示了一个规律：任何一种文明都要与时偕行，不断吸纳时代精华。新时代新征程，我们要积极主动学习借鉴人类创造的一切优秀成果，以海纳百川的胸怀打破文化交往的壁垒，以兼收并蓄的态度汲取各国文明的养分，以自信开放的姿态更好推动中华文化走出去。要进一步推动马克思主义同中华优秀传统文化相结合，使其从“彼此契合”到“互相成就”，让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的。要不断培育和创造中国特色社会主义文化，坚持不忘本来、吸收外来、面向未来，传承发展中华优秀传统文化，促进外来文化本土化，推动中华文化更好走向世界。 四 知常明变者赢，守正创新者进。对文化建设来说，坚持守正创新是遵循文化发展规律的必然选择，也是掌握思想和文化主动的根本要求。守正与创新相辅相成，体现了思想文化工作“变”与“不变”、继承与发展、原则性与创造性的辩证统一，蕴含了中华文明绵延不绝、经久不衰、繁荣兴盛的“基因密码”，彰显了中华民族守正不守旧、尊古不复古的进取精神和民族智慧。 “本根不摇则枝叶茂荣”。中华文明的连续性，从根本上决定了中华民族必然走自己的路，走中国特色社会主义文化发展道路。守正，守的是马克思主义在意识形态领域指导地位的根本制度，守的是“两个结合”的根本要求，守的是中国共产党的文化领导权和中华民族的文化主体性。要坚持中国特色社会主义文化发展道路，着力加强党对宣传思想文化工作的领导，着力建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态，着力培育和践行社会主义核心价值观，着力提升新闻舆论传播力引导力影响力公信力，着力赓续中华文脉、推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化和创新性发展，着力推动文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展，着力加强国际传播能力建设、促进文明交流互鉴，不断以“两个结合”巩固文化主体性，巩固全党全军全国各族人民团结奋斗的共同思想基础。 “不日新者必日退”。文明永续发展，既需要薪火相传、代代守护，更需要顺时应势、推陈出新。创新创造是文化的生命所在，也是文化的本质特征，为建设中华民族现代文明提供强大动力和广阔空间。创新，创的是新思路、新话语、新机制、新形式，要在马克思主义指导下真正做到古为今用、洋为中用、辩证取舍、推陈出新，实现传统与现代的有机衔接，努力创造属于我们这个时代的新文化，建设中华民族现代文明。 （执笔：彭春淋、王强、刘光明）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115000424/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266414.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231113072032/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16266414.html,2023-11-15 0:00:00,Taking up a new cultural mission at a new historical starting point Source: china military net - liberation army news Author: peng chunlin Wang Qiang Liu Guangming Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-13 06:08:49 0,"Taking up a new cultural mission at a new historical starting point ■ Center for the Study of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era at National Defense University The soul of the nation is to be transformed by culture and forged by culture. President Xi has given important instructions on national propaganda and ideological and cultural work, emphasizing the new cultural mission of continuing to promote cultural prosperity, building a cultural powerhouse, and constructing a modern civilization for the Chinese nation from a new historical starting point, firming up cultural self-confidence, upholding openness and inclusiveness, and insisting on observing righteousness and innovation. This important instruction clearly defines the principle requirements and practical path to take up the new cultural mission, and provides a fundamental guideline for us to do a good job in propaganda, ideology and culture in the new era and new journey. Propaganda, ideological and cultural work has a bearing on the future destiny of the party, the long-term stability of the country, and the cohesion and centripetal force of the nation, and is an extremely important task. President Xi put forward and clear ""new cultural mission"" this major proposition, will be from the spirit of cultural cohesion of the whole party, the whole army, the whole country people of all ethnic groups, for the comprehensive construction of a modernized socialist country, comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to provide a strong ideological guarantee, a strong spiritual force, favorable cultural conditions. Only by standing up and standing firm spiritually can a nation stand tall and stand up to the tide in the torrent of history. The common ideological foundation, spiritual will and cultural pursuit is the cultural cornerstone and spiritual bond on which a party, a country and a nation depend for their existence and development. Most of the political parties, societies and countries that have gone into turmoil, tended to split up, and even eventually fell apart, have learned a profound lesson from the lack of a common cultural cornerstone. In the course of thousands of years of history, the Chinese nation has encountered countless difficulties and hardships, but they have survived and come through, and one of the important reasons for this is the cultivation and development of a unique and profound Chinese culture, which has provided a strong spiritual support for the Chinese nation to overcome difficulties and live on. With the ""new cultural mission"" to establish the heart of the country and the soul of the nation, the people will be united in ideals, values and morals, and will become a community of thought and emotion to promote the construction of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the nation, and will unite the spiritual strength to strive for unity and self-improvement. The 20th CPC National Congress has drawn a grand blueprint for the comprehensive construction of a modernized socialist country and the comprehensive promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization. Chinese-style modernization is a modernization that harmonizes material civilization and spiritual civilization, deeply rooted in the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and a brand-new form of human civilization. The modern civilization of the Chinese nation is formed in the process of promoting Chinese-style modernization, and is the cultural form of Chinese-style modernization, a new organically unified cultural life form formed through the ""two combinations"", especially the second combination. By leading the Chinese spirit and gathering Chinese power with the ""new cultural mission"", we can further promote the great social revolution and build the foundation of ""Chinese modernization endows Chinese civilization with modern strength, and Chinese civilization endows Chinese modernization with deep content"". Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the importance of firm cultural self-confidence, pointing out that ""to be firm in cultural self-confidence is to insist on walking on one's own path"", and in particular, juxtaposing cultural self-confidence with confidence in roads, theories and systems, elevating the self-confidence of the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation in socialism with Chinese characteristics to an unprecedented high level, and greatly enhancing the confidence of Chinese people in being Chinese. This has greatly strengthened the will, backbone, and spirit of being Chinese. The rise of culture is the rise of the nation, and the strength of culture is the strength of the nation. Without a high degree of cultural confidence, it is impossible to have a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics that we are following today is inseparable from the Chinese civilization of more than 5,000 years. Chinese civilization is the only great civilization in the world that has continued and developed in the form of a nation to this day. The rich cosmic, universal, social and moral values of the excellent traditional Chinese culture have been internalized in the road, theories and systems of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and have been glowing with enduring spiritual charisma and cultural radiance. With firm cultural self-confidence, we can further insist on the main position of the Chinese people in the creation of China's history, and on the cultural subjectivity of the Chinese nation, and we will have an incomparably broad stage, an incomparably deep historical background, and an incomparably strong determination to move forward. One of the basic points running through our party's struggle for more than a hundred years is that China's problems must be answered from China's basic national conditions and by the Chinese themselves. Firm cultural self-confidence is to be based on the great historical practice of the Chinese nation and contemporary practice, summarize the Chinese experience with Chinese reasoning, upgrade the Chinese experience into Chinese theory, neither blindly follow all kinds of dogma, nor copy foreign theories, and realize the spirit of independence and autonomy. We should be good at drawing nourishment and wisdom from the excellent traditional culture of the Chinese nation, which has been formed and accumulated for generations, continuing the cultural genes, extracting the essence of ideas, displaying the spiritual charms, and maintaining a high degree of confidence in our own cultural ideals and values, as well as in the vitality and creativity of our own culture. We should integrate cultural confidence into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the whole nation, not revere foreign countries or be extremely xenophobic, and cultivate a vigorous and upward-looking outlook and a rational and calm mindset, so that we can move into the future with a new outlook and a confident pace. As we enter a new era, President Xi has made a series of important assertions about openness and tolerance, proposing that ""we need a broader mind than the sky when dealing with different civilizations"", stressing ""to carry out cultural exchanges with other countries more extensively, and to study and learn from the achievements of all the world's excellent civilizations more proactively. He emphasized ""more extensive cultural exchanges with other countries and more proactive learning from the fruits of all the world's excellent civilizations"", and sincerely called on all countries in the world to ""put into practice the Global Civilization Initiative, so as to inject deep and lasting cultural strength into the promotion of the building of a community of shared destiny for humankind. These insightful remarks have clarified the direction for us to deepen exchanges and mutual learning, tell a good Chinese story, and disseminate a good Chinese voice. The vastness of Chinese civilization is attributed to the openness and tolerance of Chinese culture since ancient times. At the Symposium on Cultural Inheritance and Development, President Xi profoundly pointed out, ""Chinese civilization has an outstanding inclusiveness, which fundamentally determines the historical orientation of the Chinese nation to interact, exchange and mingle, the harmonious pattern of pluralism and coexistence of various religious beliefs in China, and the openness of Chinese culture to the world's civilizations."" From species and technology, to resources and people, to ideas and culture, Chinese civilization has developed and progressed precisely through continuous dissemination, exchange and interaction. With openness and tolerance, we will be able to transcend civilizational barriers through civilizational exchanges, transcend civilizational conflicts through mutual understanding, and transcend civilizational superiority through civilizational coexistence, so that we can nourish Chinese civilization in openness and tolerance and continue to forge a new glory of Chinese culture. The history of world civilization reveals a law: any civilization has to keep pace with the times and continuously absorb the essence of the times. In this new era and new journey, we should proactively learn from all the excellent achievements created by mankind, break down the barriers of cultural exchanges with an open mind, draw on the sustenance of civilizations of different countries with an eclectic attitude, and promote Chinese culture to go out with a confident and open attitude. We should further promote the combination of Marxism and Chinese excellent traditional culture, so that they can move from ""matching each other"" to ""accomplishing each other"", making Marxism Chinese and Chinese excellent traditional culture modern. We should continue to cultivate and create a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the principle of not forgetting the past, absorbing the present and facing the future, inherit and develop the excellent traditional Chinese culture, promote the localization of foreign cultures, and promote the betterment of Chinese culture to the world. Fourth, those who know how to change will win, and those who abide by the right and innovate will advance. For the construction of culture, adhering to the right and innovation is the inevitable choice of following the law of cultural development, and is also the fundamental requirement of mastering the initiative of thought and culture. Keeping the right and innovation complement each other, embodying the dialectical unity of ""change"" and ""no change"", inheritance and development, principle and creativity in ideological and cultural work, and implying the ""genetic code"" of Chinese civilization that is unceasing, enduring, and prosperous, and manifesting the ""genetic code"" of Chinese civilization. It contains the ""genetic code"" of Chinese civilization that has endured, prospered and prospered, and demonstrates the enterprising spirit and national wisdom of the Chinese nation to keep the right but not the old, and to respect the ancient but not the retroactive. ""If the root is not shaken, the branches and leaves will flourish"". The continuity of Chinese civilization fundamentally determines that the Chinese nation is bound to follow its own path, the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics. The fundamental system of the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field, the fundamental requirement of the ""two combinations"", the cultural leadership of the CPC and the cultural subjectivity of the Chinese nation are all to be observed. We should adhere to the road of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, focus on strengthening the Party's leadership of propaganda and ideological and cultural work, focus on building a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leadership, focus on cultivating and practicing socialist core values, focus on enhancing the power of news and public opinion to disseminate, guide and influence, enhance the credibility of news and public opinion, and focus on the continuation of the Chinese cultural lineage and promoting the creative transformation and innovative development of the Chinese outstanding traditional culture. Efforts are being made to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings and cultural industries, to strengthen the building of international communication capacity, to promote exchanges and mutual understanding of civilizations, and to consolidate the main body of culture and the common ideological foundation for the unity of the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation by ""two combinations"". ""Those who do not innovate daily will retreat daily"". The sustainable development of civilization requires not only passing on the flame and guarding it from one generation to the next, but also adapting to the times and pushing forward with new ideas. Innovation and creativity is the life of culture and its essential characteristic, providing a strong impetus and a broad space for the construction of the modern civilization of the Chinese nation. Innovation is the creation of new ideas, new words, new mechanisms and new forms. Under the guidance of Marxism, we should truly use the past for the present and the foreign for the Chinese, make dialectical choices, push forward the new, realize the organic convergence of the traditional and the modern, and strive to create a new culture belonging to our era, and build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation.

推动新时代爱国主义教育深入人心 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李琦 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-17 06:50:39 0,推动新时代爱国主义教育深入人心 ■李琦 爱国主义是中华民族的民族心、民族魂，是中华儿女最自然、最朴素的情感，是中华民族精神的核心。《新时代爱国主义教育实施纲要》提出要“坚持以立为本、重在建设”，指出“爱国主义教育是全民教育”“推动爱国主义教育融入贯穿国民教育和精神文明建设全过程”。新时代大力弘扬爱国主义精神，必须把爱国主义教育作为永恒主题，融入国民教育全过程。 强化教育引导，准确把握当代中国爱国主义的鲜明主题和本质特征。爱国主义是一个历史范畴，在社会发展的不同阶段、不同时期有不同的具体内涵。习近平总书记指出：“实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，是当代中国爱国主义的鲜明主题。”中华民族伟大复兴是中华民族近代以来最伟大的梦想，凝聚了几代中国人的夙愿，是新时代弘扬爱国主义的主旋律。习近平总书记将中华民族伟大复兴的奋斗目标以“中国梦”作形象化、大众化表达，强调“中国梦”的基本内涵是实现国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福，把国家、民族和个人作为一个“命运共同体”，体现了国家追求、民族向往、人民期盼的有机统一，成为民族复兴征程上的一面精神旗帜。需要强调的是，爱国不是抽象的，而是具体的、历史的，祖国的命运和党的命运、社会主义的命运密不可分，“只有坚持爱国和爱党、爱社会主义相统一，爱国主义才是鲜活的、真实的，这是当代中国爱国主义精神最重要的体现”。中华人民共和国是中国共产党领导的社会主义国家，爱国和爱党、爱社会主义的统一是历史形成的、现实存在的，集中体现在中国特色社会主义事业中。当代中国，爱国主义首先体现在对中国共产党的热爱和对社会主义中国的热爱，爱国主义的本质就是坚持爱国和爱党、爱社会主义的高度统一。 突出实践养成，把爱国主义精神内化于心、外化于行。“对每一个中国人来说，爱国是本分，也是职责，是心之所系、情之所归。”爱国主义是一堂人生必修课，要面向全体人民、聚焦青少年进行爱国主义教育，着力培养爱国之情、砥砺强国之志、实践报国之行，使爱国主义成为全体中国人民的坚定信念、精神力量和自觉行动。爱国主义作为一种道德规范和政治原则，既需要深厚的情感，还需要从思想到行动的升华。习近平总书记指出：“爱国，不能停留在口号上，而是要把自己的理想同祖国的前途、把自己的人生同民族的命运紧密联系在一起，扎根人民，奉献国家。”教育是永恒主题，践行是根本目的。爱国主义教育的成效如何，归根结底要落实在行动上、体现在实践中，关键在于能否引导全体人民把爱国热情转化为实际的报国行动。新时代要大力推进爱国主义教育，引导广大人民特别是青年一代立足本职、拼搏奋斗、创新创造，把爱国之情、报国之志融入祖国改革发展的伟大事业之中、融入人民创造历史的伟大奋斗之中，从自己做起，从本职岗位做起，在新时代作出应有的贡献，在推进中华民族伟大复兴中实现人生价值。 落实制度保障，切实加强对爱国主义教育的组织领导。制度具有根本性、全局性、稳定性、长期性。将爱国主义教育写入法律、形成制度，有利于推动和保障新时代爱国主义教育持续健康发展。我国宪法明确规定，国家要在人民中进行爱国主义教育。近年来，爱国主义相关的各类法律法规、市民公约、村规民约、学生守则、行业规范、团体章程等逐步得到完善。2019年11月，中共中央、国务院印发《新时代爱国主义教育实施纲要》，深入阐明新时代爱国主义教育的总体要求、基本内容。党的二十大报告提出，“深化爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育，着力培养担当民族复兴大任的时代新人”。十四届全国人大常委会第六次会议表决通过《中华人民共和国爱国主义教育法》，自2024年1月1日起施行。制定爱国主义教育法，旨在加强爱国主义教育、传承和弘扬爱国主义精神，以法治手段保障爱国主义教育常态化，把爱国主义教育融入国民教育和精神文明建设全过程、各环节。各级党委和政府要负起政治责任和领导责任，进一步健全党委统一领导、党政齐抓共管、宣传部门统筹协调、有关部门各负其责的工作格局，建立爱国主义教育联席会议制度，确保爱国主义教育各项任务要求落到实处，推动新时代爱国主义教育深入人心，为强国建设、民族复兴凝聚起磅礴力量。 （作者单位：四川大学马克思主义学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118000346/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267480.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231117075803/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267480.html,2023-11-18 0:00:00,Promoting Patriotism Education in the New Era Source: china military net - liberation army newspaper Author: Li Qi Editor-in-chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-17 06:50:39 0,"Promoting patriotic education in the new era ■ Li Qi Patriotism is the national heart and soul of the Chinese nation, is the most natural and simple feelings of Chinese children, is the core of the spirit of the Chinese nation. The Outline for the Implementation of Patriotism Education in the New Era proposes to ""adhere to the principle of establishing patriotism as the foundation and emphasize its construction"", and points out that ""patriotism education is the education of all people"" and ""promote the integration of patriotism education into the whole process of national education and the construction of spiritual civilization"". The new era vigorously promotes patriotism as an integral part of education for all. To vigorously promote the spirit of patriotism in the new era, it is necessary to make patriotic education an eternal theme and integrate it into the entire process of national education. Strengthen education and guidance, and accurately grasp the distinctive theme and essential features of patriotism in contemporary China. Patriotism is a historical category with different specific connotations at different stages of social development and different periods. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the distinctive theme of contemporary Chinese patriotism."" The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation since modern times, unites the long-cherished wishes of several generations of Chinese people, and is the main theme of the new era to promote patriotism. General Secretary Xi Jinping has visualized and popularized the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the form of the ""Chinese Dream"", stressing that the basic connotation of the ""Chinese Dream"" is to realize the wealth and strength of the country, the revitalization of the nation, and the happiness of the people, and treating the country, the nation, and the individual as a ""community of destiny"". The ""community of destiny"" embodies the organic unity of the country's pursuit, the nation's aspirations and the people's expectations, and has become a spiritual banner on the journey of national rejuvenation. It should be emphasized that patriotism is not abstract, but concrete and historical, and that the destiny of the motherland is inextricably linked to the destiny of the Party and socialism, and that ""only by insisting on the unity of patriotism and love of the Party and socialism is patriotism alive and real, which is the most important manifestation of the spirit of patriotism in contemporary China."" The People's Republic of China is a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the unity of patriotism and love of the Party and socialism is historically formed and real, and is centrally embodied in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In contemporary China, patriotism is first and foremost embodied in the love of the CPC and the love of socialist China, and the essence of patriotism is to adhere to the high degree of unity of patriotism and love of the Party and socialism. Highlighting the practice of formation, the spirit of patriotism is internalized in the heart and externalized in behavior. ""For every Chinese person, patriotism is a duty and a responsibility, and it is the heart of the heart and the love of the heart."" Patriotism is a compulsory life lesson, patriotism education for all people, focusing on young people, focusing on cultivating patriotic feelings, sharpening the will to strengthen the country, and practicing the act of serving the country, so that patriotism has become the firm conviction, spiritual strength and conscious action of all Chinese people. Patriotism, as a moral code and political principle, requires both deep emotion and sublimation from thought to action. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Patriotism should not remain on slogans, but should closely link one's ideals with the future of the motherland and one's life with the destiny of the nation, rooted in the people and dedicated to the country."" Education is an eternal theme, and practicing it is the fundamental purpose. How effective patriotic education is, in the final analysis, should be realized in action, embodied in practice, the key lies in whether it can guide all the people to turn patriotic fervor into practical actions to serve the country. In the new era, we should vigorously promote patriotic education, guide the people, especially the young generation, to base on their own duties, struggle, innovation and creativity, and integrate the love of the country, the will to serve the country into the great cause of the motherland's reform and development, and into the people's great struggle to create history, starting from their own, starting from their own positions, to make their due contribution to the new era, and to realize the value of their lives in the advancement of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Implement institutional safeguards and effectively strengthen the organizational leadership of patriotic education. The system is fundamental, global, stable and long-term. Writing patriotism education into law and forming an institution is conducive to promoting and guaranteeing the sustained and healthy development of patriotism education in the new era. Our Constitution clearly stipulates that the state shall carry out patriotic education among the people. In recent years, various laws and regulations related to patriotism, civic conventions, village rules and regulations, student codes, industry norms, and group bylaws have been gradually improved.In November 2019, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the Outline for the Implementation of Patriotism Education in the New Era, which thoroughly clarifies the general requirements and basic contents of patriotism education in the new era. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress proposed to ""deepen education on patriotism, collectivism and socialism, and strive to cultivate new men of the times who will take up the big responsibility of national rejuvenation."" The Patriotic Education Law of the People's Republic of China was voted on and passed at the Sixth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fourteenth National People's Congress, to come into effect from January 1, 2024 onwards. The enactment of the Patriotism Education Law is aimed at strengthening patriotism education, passing on and carrying forward the spirit of patriotism, guaranteeing the normalization of patriotism education by means of the rule of law, and integrating patriotism education into the whole process and all aspects of national education and spiritual civilization construction. Party committees and governments at all levels should take up the political and leadership responsibilities, further improve the working pattern of unified leadership of the Party committee, joint management by the Party and government, overall coordination by the propaganda department, and responsibility of relevant departments, establish a joint meeting system for patriotism education, ensure that the requirements of the tasks of patriotism education are put into practice, and push the patriotism education of the new era into the hearts of the people to unite the mighty forces for the construction of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the nation. (Author's unit: School of Marxism, Sichuan University)","The article discusses the promotion of patriotism education in the new era. It emphasizes the importance of patriotism as a fundamental aspect of Chinese culture and the core of the spirit of the Chinese nation. In contemporary China, patriotism is embodied in the love of the CPC and the love of socialist China, and its essence is the high degree of unity of patriotism and love of the Party and socialism.

加强联合作战体系和能力建设丨把“硬指头”攥成“铁拳头” 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：肖学祥 刘杨钺 申红心 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-17 06:46:01 0,把“硬指头”攥成“铁拳头” ——怎么看加强联合作战体系和能力建设 “东部”“南部”“西部”“北部”“中部”系列联合实兵演习，陆海空天电网等作战单元无缝链接，情报信息、指挥控制、火力打击等作战要素有机融合……一场场联合作战演练，铺陈出一幅幅联合赋能的强军画卷。现代战争，无战不联，无联不胜。只有着眼联合一体、同步释能，把每个节点、每个要素都建强练硬，通过整体联动、高效聚合实现攥指成拳，才能把握战争大势，掌控战场大局，谋取联合制胜主动权。 为什么要优化联合作战指挥体系？ 冰山运动，是自然界的一种奇观，它的巨大力量不仅来自于水面上的八分之一，更蕴藏在水下的八分之七。现代战争，如果说火力、机动力等是水面上的“八分之一”，那么水面下起支撑作用的“八分之七”则是体系能力。 当前，战争形态加速向信息化智能化战争演变，一体化联合作战成为基本作战形式，平台作战、体系支撑，战术行动、战略保障成为现代战争的显著特点。可以说，现代战争拼的是体系、打的是联合，从来没有一个时代像今天这样，如此需要各种作战力量的整体联动、高效聚合。战场上，飞机看似还是那架飞机，大炮看似还是那个大炮，但“机”自为战、“炮”自为战已成为历史，如果不能融入体系、形成联合，再先进的武器装备也难以高效发挥作用。这就要求改变以往“各自为战”的思维，各作战力量、要素、单元主动融入联合作战体系，依托体系聚合，实现统一意图、共享信息、协同行动，达到1+1>2的联合效益。 现代战争作战指挥战略性、联合性、时效性、专业性、精确性要求越来越高。如果没有先进作战指挥体系，在敌方强力干扰和猛烈打击下，很可能一打起来就同自己的部队“失联”，无法联络，也无法指挥，更谈不上消灭敌人。 2022年9月的一天，时针跳过“零点”，东部战区联指中心大厅内依然充满着浓浓的“战味儿”，大屏上的态势图实时更新，各军兵种信息在这里融合流转，各席位值班人员有条不紊分析、研判、处理……近年来，随着任务区域情况越来越复杂，处置要求越来越高，战区不断加强联合作战指挥运行机制建设，情况处置更加灵活高效，联合指挥能力得到明显提升。党的十八大以来，在习主席亲自决策领导下，健全军委联合作战指挥机构、创设军委联指中心，划设五大战区、组建战区联合作战指挥机构，构建起平战一体、常态运行、专司主营、精干高效的战略战役指挥体系。 联合作战指挥体系应战而生，也必将因战而变、向战而优。经过改革，我军领导指挥体制“联”的壁垒已被打破，“联”的机制已经建立，但联合作战指挥体系的构建绝非一劳永逸。我们要打赢未来战争，必须持续优化联合作战指挥体系这个“大脑”和“中枢”，有效协调控制力量聚合和能量释放，让各种作战力量、作战单元、作战要素配合起来，打通联合作战全系统全流程指挥链路，使部队行动如臂使指、如虎添翼，真正形成强大整体威力。 为什么要深化联合训练、对抗训练？ 朱日和，原本一个名不见经传的塞北小镇，今天却广为人知。10多年来，朱日和训练基地先后导调、保障上百场陆空联合演习和网上对抗演习，参训部队越来越全、演练强度越来越大、演练科目越来越多，一支支部队在联合对抗中加快战斗力生成。放眼今天的演兵场，体系、联合、对抗成为部队训练的高频词。党的二十大报告强调，深入推进实战化军事训练，深化联合训练、对抗训练、科技练兵。这对我们抓好新时代军事训练提出了更高标准和要求，要聚焦“深化”用劲，瞄准“深化”发力，坚持以联合训练为牵引、对抗训练为核心、科技练兵为支撑，不断提高练兵备战质效和水平。 现代战争对联合训练提出强制性要求，不开展体系训练、不深化联合训练，打赢未来战争就是一句空话。“多军兵种联合时的‘分界线’和‘结合部’由谁负责、由谁保障？”“地面分队如何利用空军无人机进行战场侦察？”“医疗保障分队怎样预判战局、对接任务？”这是2022年7月陆军某师携手12家军兵种单位开展复盘检讨时的场景。一场联演联训刷新多项纪录，军兵种单位共研联训之道，推动联合训练不断向深处走、往实里落。平时多磨合，战时才能实现联合制胜，让部队从“积木组合”走向“血脉相通”，增加打赢明天战争的砝码。联合训练服务联合作战需求，催生联合作战能力，必须不断实起来、联起来。要坚持以联为纲，强化体系训练思想，抓好全系统、全要素、全流程训练，破解联合训练、联合行动、联合保障方面的重点问题，加速提升一体化联合作战能力。 刘伯承元帅在指导一次演习时指出：“对抗就要互为敌人。敌人会对你仁慈吗？你会对敌人手软吗？平时多搞强一些的对抗，上了战场才打得了硬仗。”对抗训练是强化实战练兵最有效的练兵方式之一，对于摸清能力底数、提高实战本领具有重要作用。实践证明，敌情设得越“像”，环境设得越“真”，态势设得越“活”，越能发现自己的“长”和“短”。深化对抗训练，要创新对抗训练模式，瞄准强敌对手、围绕关键任务、着眼能力检验，创新管用实用的战法训法；优化对抗训练条件，体系推进实战化训练环境和对抗条件建设，构建规模适度、要素齐全、合成高效的蓝军力量体系；完善对抗训练机制，建立健全组织实施、过程监管、裁决评判、运行保障等制度规范，确保对抗训练在近似实战的环境中真正抗起来、严起来。 为什么要提高备战打仗人才供给能力和水平？ 近年来，面对我国经济发展中供给与需求的深层次结构性矛盾和问题，党中央作出推进供给侧结构性改革重大战略决策。供给和需求作为市场经济内在关系的两个方面，二者相互依存、互为条件，没有需求，供给就无从实现；没有供给，需求就无法满足。军队为打仗而存在，军队建设必须服从备战打仗根本需要。人才是推动我军高质量发展、赢得军事竞争和未来战争主动的关键因素，必须着力提高备战打仗人才供给能力和水平。 东北老航校被誉为“中国人民航空事业的摇篮”。为培养人民空军的“种子”，他们发扬“团结奋斗、艰苦创业、勇于献身、开拓新路”的精神，创造了人推火车、马拉飞机、酒精代汽油、直上高教机等奇迹，在1946年3月创办后的3年多时间里，就培养出126名飞行员、24名领航员和410名航空工程、通信、气象等各类航空技术人才，造就了一大批懂航空技术业务的军事、政治、后勤、技术管理干部。他们有的一毕业就走上了抗美援朝战场，涌现出王海、张积慧、刘玉堤等众多空战英雄。正是依靠无数当兵打仗、带兵打仗、练兵打仗的军事人才，人民军队在党的旗帜下锻造成攻无不克、战无不胜的钢铁雄师。无论形势任务怎么变化、战争形态怎么演变，备战打仗人才方阵强了，制胜战场就有了坚实的支撑保障。 我军人才工作说到底是为战争准备人才。解析现代战争，无论是作战概念开发还是武器装备操作，无论是战争筹划设计还是作战计划实施，都要靠人才。我军人才队伍整体水平滞后于强军实践发展，还存在不少短板弱项，说到底是人才队伍实战能力素养不强。必须贯彻新时代人才强军战略，坚持以作战需求牵引人才需求，按照能打仗、打胜仗的要求，集中更多资源，构建新型军事人才体系，建强联合作战指挥人才、新型作战力量人才、高层次科技创新人才、高水平战略管理人才等各方面人才队伍，推动人才建设水平整体跃升，确保以人才优势支撑我军不断从胜利走向胜利。 （执笔：肖学祥、刘杨钺、申红心）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118000346/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267479.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231117075704/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267479.html,2023-11-18 0:00:00,"Strengthening the Joint Warfare System and Capacity Building 丨clenching the ""hard fingers"" into an ""iron fist"" Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Xiao Xuexiang Liu Yangyue Shen Hongxin Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-17 06:46:01 0","Clenching ""hard fingers"" into ""iron fists"" - how to see the strengthening of the joint operation system and capacity building ""East"", ""South"", ""West"", ""North"" and ""Central"" series of joint operations ""South, West, North, Central"" series of joint maneuvers. Practical exercises, land, sea, air and sky power grid and other combat units seamlessly linked, intelligence information, command and control, fire strikes and other combat elements organically integrated ...... a joint combat exercises, spread out a picture of a joint empowerment of the strong military scroll. Modern warfare, no war, no link, no link can not win. Only focusing on the joint one, synchronized release of energy, each node, each element are built strong practice hard, through the overall linkage, efficient aggregation to achieve the clenched fingers into a fist, in order to grasp the war situation, control the battlefield situation, and seek the initiative of the joint victory. Why optimize the joint combat command system? Iceberg movement, a spectacle of nature, its enormous power not only from the water surface of one-eighth, more hidden in the underwater seven-eighths. Modern war, if the firepower, mechanical power, etc. is the surface of the ""one-eighth"", then under the water to play a supporting role in the ""seven-eighths"" is the system capacity. At present, the war form accelerated to the informationization of intelligent war evolution, integration of joint operations has become the basic form of combat, platform combat, system support, tactical action, strategic security has become a significant feature of modern war. It can be said that modern war is a system, fighting is a joint, there has never been an era like today, so much need for a variety of combat forces of the overall linkage, efficient aggregation. On the battlefield, the aircraft seems to be the same aircraft, artillery seems to be the same artillery, but the ""machine"" for the war, ""gun"" for the war has become history, if you can not be integrated into the system, the formation of the joint, and then the advanced weaponry is difficult to play a role in the high efficiency. This calls for a change in the previous ""separate war"" thinking, the combat forces, elements, units take the initiative to integrate into the joint combat system, relying on the system aggregation, to achieve a unified intent, sharing information, coordinated action, to achieve 1 +1 > 2 joint benefit. Modern war combat command strategic, joint, timeliness, professionalism, precision requirements are increasingly high. If there is no advanced combat command system, in the enemy's strong interference and fierce blows, it is likely to fight with their own troops ""lost contact"", can not contact, can not command, let alone eliminate the enemy. One day in September 2022, the clock hand jumped over ""zero point"", the eastern theater joint command center hall is still full of strong ""war flavor"", the big screen on the situation map real-time updates, the military services information in the fusion of the flow here, the seat of the duty officer methodically! Analyze, study, deal with ...... In recent years, with the task of the regional situation is more and more complex, the disposal of more and more high requirements, the war zone continue to strengthen the joint operation of the operational mechanism of the construction of the situation is more flexible and efficient, the joint command capacity has been significantly improved. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, under the leadership of President Xi's personal decision-making, the military commission has improved the joint combat command structure, created the military commission's joint fingerprint center, set up five major war zones, and formed the joint combat command structure of the war zones, and constructed a strategic combat command system that is integrated with the war, operates on a regular basis, and specializes in the main camp, which is competent and efficient. The joint operation command system was born in response to the war, and will certainly be changed and optimized for the war. After the reform, our military leadership and command system ""joint"" barriers have been broken, ""joint"" mechanism has been established, but the construction of the joint operational command system is by no means permanent. We want to win the future war, we must continue to optimize the joint operation command system this ""brain"" and ""center"", effective coordination and control of power aggregation and energy release, so that a variety of combat forces, combat units, combat elements with the joint operation of the whole process of command link. The whole system and process of the command link, so that the troops act like an arm, like a tiger to add wings, and really form a strong overall power. Why deepen joint training, confrontation training? Zhu Rihe, originally a little-known town in the north of Serbia, today is widely known. 10 years, Zhu Rihe training base has guided, safeguarded hundreds of land and air joint exercises and online confrontation exercises, participating in the training forces more and more full, more and more intensity of exercises, more and more subjects, a unit in the joint confrontation to speed up the generation of combat power. Looking at today's drill ground, the system, joint, confrontation has become a high-frequency word for the training of troops. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress emphasizes that it will further promote combat-oriented military training, deepen joint training, confrontation training, and scientific and technological training. This puts forward higher standards and requirements for us to grasp the new era of military training, we should focus on ""deepening"" vigorously, aiming at ""deepening"" force, adhere to the joint training as the traction, confrontation training as the core, scientific and technological training as a support, and constantly improve the quality of training and preparation for war and the level. The level of training and preparation for war has been continuously improved. Modern war puts forward mandatory requirements for joint training, do not carry out systematic training, do not deepen the joint training, win the future war is an empty word. ""Who is responsible for the 'demarcation line' and the 'combined area' in the case of multi-military and military jointness, and by whom is it guaranteed?"" ""How do ground detachments utilize Air Force drones for battlefield reconnaissance?"" ""How does a medical support detachment anticipate the battlefield and buttress the mission?"" This was the scene in July 2022 when an Army division joined hands with 12 military units to conduct a review. A joint exercise and training to refresh a number of records, military units to study the way of joint training, to promote joint training to the depths, to the actual fall. More integration in peacetime, wartime to achieve joint victory, so that the troops from the ""combination of building blocks"" to ""bloodline"", increasing the weight of winning tomorrow's war. Joint training service joint combat demand, give birth to joint combat capability, must continue to real up, joint up. To adhere to the United as a program, strengthen the system training ideas, grasp the whole system, the whole element, the whole process of training, to crack the joint training, joint operations, joint security aspects of the key issues, to accelerate the enhancement of the integration of the joint combat capability. Marshal Liu Bocheng pointed out in the guidance of an exercise: ""Confrontation should be mutual enemies. Will the enemy be kind to you? Will you be soft on the enemy? Usually more strong confrontation, on the battlefield to fight a hard battle."" Confrontation training is one of the most effective ways to strengthen the practice of actual combat practice, and it plays an important role in figuring out the bottom of the capacity and improving the actual combat skills. Practice has proved that the more ""like"" the enemy set up, the more ""real"" the environment set up, the more ""live"" the situation set up, the more you can find their ""long"" and ""short"". ""and"" short "". Deepen the confrontation training, to innovate the confrontation training mode, aiming at the strong enemy opponents, around the key tasks, focusing on the ability to test, innovative and practical methods of warfare training method; optimize the confrontation training conditions, the system to promote the combat training environment and confrontation conditions, build the scale of the appropriate, complete elements, synthesis of efficient blue force system; improve the confrontation training mechanism, to establish and improve the implementation of the organization, the process of supervision, adjudication and judging, The company will also improve the mechanism of confrontation training, establish and improve the organization and implementation, process supervision, adjudication and evaluation, operation and security systems and norms to ensure that the confrontation training in the near real-world environment is really resistant to, strict. Why is it necessary to improve the ability and level of supplying talents for war preparation and fighting? In recent years, in the face of the deep-rooted structural contradictions and problems of supply and demand in China's economic development, the CPC Central Committee has made a major strategic decision to promote supply-side structural reform. Supply and demand as two aspects of the intrinsic relationship of the market economy, the two are interdependent and mutually conditional, without demand, supply can not be realized; without supply, demand can not be met. Without supply, demand cannot be met. The army exists for the purpose of fighting wars, and army construction must be subject to the fundamental need of preparing for and fighting wars. Talent is a key factor in promoting the high-quality development of our army and winning the initiative in military competition and future wars, and we must focus on improving the ability and level of supplying talents for war preparation and fighting. The old Northeast Aviation School is known as the ""cradle of Chinese people's aviation"". In order to cultivate the ""seeds"" of the People's Air Force, they carried forward the spirit of ""unity and hard work, dedication and pioneering a new way"", and created miracles such as pushing trains, pulling airplanes, substituting alcohol for gasoline, and going straight up to the high school plane, etc., and in the more than three years after the founding of the school in March 1946, the school had cultivated a lot of talents for war preparation. In more than 3 years after its establishment in March 1946, the school has trained 126 pilots, 24 navigators and 410 aviation engineering, communications, meteorology and other types of aviation technical personnel, and created a large number of military, political, logistical and technical management cadres who understand the technical business of aviation. Some of them went to the battlefields of anti-U.S.A.R. Korea as soon as they graduated, and many air war heroes such as Wang Hai, Zhang Jihui and Liu Yuti emerged. It is by relying on countless military talents who fight in wars, lead wars, and practice wars that the People's Army has been forged into an invincible, battle-undefeatable iron and steel division under the banner of the Party. Regardless of how the situation and mission change, how the war pattern evolves, the preparation for war talent square strong, winning the battlefield will have a solid support guarantee. In the final analysis, our military talent work is to prepare talent for war. Analysis of modern war, whether it is the development of operational concepts or weapons and equipment operation, whether it is war planning and design or operational program implementation, all rely on talent. The overall level of our army talent team lags behind the development of strong military practice, there are still many shortcomings and weaknesses, in the final analysis, the talent team is not strong in combat capability. We must implement the strategy of strengthening the army with talents in the new era, adhere to the demand for talents by operational needs, focus more resources on building a new type of military talent system in accordance with the requirements of being able to fight and win battles, and build a strong talent team in various aspects, such as talents for joint operational command, new types of operational forces, high-level scientific and technological innovation talents, high-level strategic management talents, etc., so as to push the overall level of talent construction to leap forward, and to ensure that our army continues to move from victory to victory by taking the advantage of talents. Our army is constantly moving from victory to victory.

党员干部要当好“排头兵”，抓实学风强本领 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：魏顺庆 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-16 06:59:40 0,抓实学风强本领 ■魏顺庆 ●弘扬优良学风，党员干部要当好“排头兵”，以崇实、唯实、务实态度抓学习，常思虚浮、粗浅、无术之害，认真向书本学习、向实践学习、向人民群众学习 知然后行，行起于知。学习是增长知识、增加智慧、提高本领的重要途径。当前，全党正在开展学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育，对党员干部来说，如何弘扬优良学风、抓实理论武装，是党性修养的基本要求，也是责无旁贷的政治责任。只有把学风问题摆在前面，自觉“以学铸魂、以学增智、以学正风、以学促干”，做到真学真研、真懂真信、真用真做，才能推动主题教育不断往深里走、往实里走。 重视学风建设，是我党我军的鲜明特质和光荣传统。学习不仅是个人成长成才之基，更是党和国家事业发展之要。党的十八大以来，广大党员干部以强国建设、民族复兴为己任，勤奋学习、勇于钻研，发现、分析和解决实际问题的能力不断提高。但从现实情况看，仍有少数人存在学风不够端正的问题。有的认为掌握的东西足够了，不学习照样能干好工作，看不到差距，盲目自满“厌烦学”；有的把学习视为负担，心不甘、情不愿，得过且过“被动学”；有的把学习当成软指标，蜻蜓点水、浅尝辄止“肤浅学”；有的把学习与实践割裂开来，不辨菽粟、脱离实际“应付学”；有的把学习当作装点门面的工具，摆花架子、做表面文章，装模作样“虚假学”……问题虽然出现在少数党员干部身上，但其危害不容小觑。倘若任其滋长蔓延，不仅会阻碍个人成长进步，还会影响单位学风建设，必须引起我们的高度重视，不能等闲视之。 学风问题是关系党风政风和党的事业的一个重大政治问题。可以说，学风正，事业兴旺；学风不正，事业受损。学者非必为仕，而仕者必为学。学风是一名党员干部思想作风和工作作风的重要表现，学不学习、学得到不到位不仅仅是自己的事情，也是关乎党和国家事业发展的大事情。“根底浅”不能成栋梁，“腹中空”难以担重任，党员干部必须自觉把学习作为一种追求、一种责任、一种健康的生活方式，做到好学、乐学，善学，让学习成为扬帆远航的动力源，让本领成为践行使命的“压舱石”。 真学真悟才能真武装。学习真不真，骗不了人。每名党员干部都应以对党、对人民、对历史高度负责的态度，坚持真学真悟，切实做到自觉学习、刻苦学习、积极学习，不断学习新知识、增长新本领。对于党员干部来说，如果不抓紧学习、不抓好学习，不在真学真悟中提高自己，就难以履行好肩负的职责使命。真学真悟，需要我们发扬“挤”和“钻”的精神。当年，毛泽东同志在延安在职干部教育动员大会上说，工作再忙，时间也可以“挤”出来，“好比木匠师傅钉一个钉子到木头上，就可以挂衣裳了”，这其中就是一个“挤”的功夫。基础差，看不懂，也有一个办法，叫作“钻”，如同木匠钻木头一样地“钻”进去，多看看，不懂的东西就懂了。党员干部须学习弘扬革命先辈的优良学风，用好“挤”和“钻”的方法，付出充足的时间和精力，扎扎实实学习，下足苦功夫、笨功夫，深钻细研、学深悟透，如此才能使自己的思想和能力跟上事业发展需要、跟上时代前进步伐，更好肩负起自身的使命。 绳短不能汲深井，浅水难以负大舟。学习是一项长期的任务，是一个日积月累的工程，没有“休止符”，只有“进行时”，决不能有任何松劲懈怠的想法，否则就会思想落伍，被时代所淘汰。“我们的干部要上进，我们的党要上进，我们的国家要上进，我们的民族要上进，就必须大兴学习之风，坚持学习、学习、再学习”， 只有一刻不停地学习提高，加快知识更新、优化知识结构，才能赢得主动、赢得优势、赢得未来。面对世界百年未有之大变局，面对伟大斗争、伟大工程、伟大事业、伟大梦想的波澜壮阔实践，我们的学习任务不是轻了，而是更重了。唯有以“时不我待、只争朝夕”的劲头笃学不怠，补足精神之“钙”，及时“充电蓄能”，方能求得真学问，练强真本领，使自身能力素质与时代发展要求相匹配，在日新月异、纷繁变化的世界中不懈前行，不断取得新成绩。 在长期的革命、建设和改革征程中，我们党坚持理论联系实际的学风，将马克思主义基本原理与中国具体实际相结合，形成了符合我国国情的理论成果，从而战胜了一个又一个困难，赢得了一个又一个胜利。中国共产党人依靠学习走到今天，也必然依靠学习走向未来。弘扬优良学风，党员干部要当好“排头兵”，以崇实、唯实、务实态度抓学习，常思虚浮、粗浅、无术之害，认真向书本学习、向实践学习、向人民群众学习。学习要坚持一切从实际出发，坚持学以致用、学用结合，反对主观主义、教条主义、形式主义，防止空对空、两张皮。既读无字之书，又学无字之技，在增智强能上下真功夫、苦功夫、细功夫，着力锤炼走在前、勇担当、善作为的硬实力，练就乘风破浪、踔厉前行的真本领，在新征程上作出不负时代、不负人民的业绩，为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦贡献力量。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118000346/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267142.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231116082256/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267142.html,2023-11-18 0:00:00,"Party members and cadres should be a good ""vanguard"", grasp the actual learning style and strong skills Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Wei Shunqing Responsibility: Sun Yue 2023-11-16 06:59:40 0","Grasp the learning style strong skills ■ Wei Shunqing ● carry forward the excellent learning style, party cadres should be a good ""vanguard"", to respect the real, only real, pragmatic attitude to grasp the learning, and often think of vain, shallow, no art of harm, seriously to the book learning, learning from the practice, learning from the people Know and then line, line from the knowledge. Learning is an important way to increase knowledge, increase wisdom and improve skills. At present, the whole party is carrying out the study and implementation of Xi Jinping new era of socialist thought with Chinese characteristics theme of education, party members and cadres, how to carry forward the excellent style of learning, grasp the theoretical armament, is the basic requirements of the party cultivation, but also the responsibility of the political responsibility. Only to put the learning style in front of the issue, consciously ""to learn to cast soul, to learn to increase wisdom, to learn to learn the wind, to learn to promote dry"", so that the real learning and research, really understand the real letter, really use the real, in order to promote the theme of education continue to go deeper and deeper, to the real go. Attaching importance to the construction of learning style, is the distinctive qualities of our party and our military and glorious tradition. Learning is not only the foundation of personal growth and success, but also the development of the Party and the country's cause. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the majority of Party members and cadres to build a strong country, national rejuvenation as their own responsibility, study diligently, the courage to study, find, analyze and solve practical problems continue to improve the ability. However, from the reality, there are still a few people who have the problem of insufficient learning style. Some think that the mastery of things enough, do not learn as well as to do a good job, do not see the gap, blind complacency ""boredom learning""; some regard learning as a burden, unwilling, reluctant, passive, ""passive learning""; some take learning as a soft indicator. Dragonfly water, shallow ""superficial learning""; some of the learning and practice cut off, do not distinguish between beans and vegetables, detached from the actual ""cope with learning""; some of the learning as a tool for window dressing, put on flowery airs, do superficial articles, pretense ""False learning""...... problem although appeared in a few party members and cadres, but its harm should not be underestimated. If you let it grow and spread, not only will hinder personal growth and progress, but also affect the unit of academic style construction, must cause us to pay great attention, can not be taken lightly. Academic style is a major political issue related to the party's political style and the party's cause. It can be said that the academic style is, the cause of prosperity; academic style is not correct, the cause of damage. Scholars are not necessarily for the service, and the service must be learned. Learning style is a party member and cadre thinking style and work style is an important manifestation of learning, learning is not learning, learning is not in place is not only their own thing, is also related to the development of the party and the country's cause of the big things. ""Roots shallow"" can not become a pillar, ""empty"" difficult to carry heavy responsibility, party members and cadres must consciously take learning as a pursuit, a responsibility, a healthy lifestyle, to do good learning, learning, learning, learning, so that learning to become a power source to sail away, so that the ability to fulfill the mission. Competence to become the mission of the ""ballast stone"". Real learning and real understanding can be really armed. Learning really not really, can not deceive people. Every party member and cadres should be to the party, to the people, to the history of the highly responsible attitude, adhere to the true learning and real understanding, and effectively do consciously learn, study hard, actively learn, and constantly learn new knowledge, grow new skills. For party members and cadres, if they do not grasp the study, do not grasp the study, do not improve themselves in the true learning, it will be difficult to fulfill the responsibilities and missions. True learning, we need to carry forward the ""squeeze"" and ""drill"" spirit. Back then, Comrade Mao Zedong in Yan'an on-the-job cadres education mobilization meeting, said that the work is busy, time can also be ""squeezed"" out, ""as if the master carpenter nailed a nail to the wood, you can hang the clothes"", which is a This is a ""squeeze"" effort. The foundation is poor, do not understand, there is a way, called ""drill"", as the carpenter drilling wood like ""drilling"" into it, and more to see, do not understand something to understand. Party members and cadres must learn to carry forward the fine learning style of the revolutionary forefathers, with a good ""squeeze"" and ""drill"" method, pay enough time and energy, solid learning, put enough hard work, stupid work, deep drilling, learning and understanding, so as to make their own thinking and This is the only way to keep up with the development of their own thinking and ability to keep up with the needs of the cause, keep pace with the times, and better shoulder their own mission. A short rope cannot draw a deep well, and shallow water is difficult to carry a big boat. Learning is a long-term task, is a cumulative project, there is no ""stop"", only ""in progress"", there must not be any slack slack idea, otherwise it will be outdated thinking, eliminated by the times. ""Our cadres to advance, our party to advance, our country to advance, our nation to advance, we must develop the wind of learning, adhere to the learning, learning, learning, and then learning"", only non-stop learning to improve, accelerate the update of knowledge, optimize the knowledge structure, in order to win the initiative, win the advantage, win the future.

打造符合军队院校自身实际的自评模式 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：余国强  任风超 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-16 06:38:07 0,探索院校教学自评模式创新 ■余国强  任风超 自评模式是军队院校科学开展自评的有力杠杆。军队院校应结合自身空间形态、功能布局、特色培育、自评队伍构成等因素，打造符合自身实际的自评模式，以更好地推动自评工作简约高效开展。 “橄榄球”式自评模式 部分院校机关与系室等基层单位在空间形态、功能布局上集中分布，中心主导作用突出。但自评模式如果选择不合理，容易出现统得过细、基层难展“拳脚”等问题。 该类型院校在组织自评时，可借鉴“橄榄球”式自评模式。即初期以院校机关为主体统纲立框，中期以基层单位为主力分类定标，后期以自评专家为骨干查评督导。该模式两端统中间分、上下协力、导疏并举，能够较好地调动人员积极性、主动性和创造性。具体实施过程中，一要聚焦主责，分段用力。院校机关在统纲立框时，重在找方向、把定位、统思路，切忌“一竿子到底”；基层在分类定标时，重在把意图搞准、把框目细化、把标准立实，切忌“上下一般粗”；专家组在查评督导时，要查到关键处、督到问题上、导到建设中，切忌“治标不治本”。二要突出重心，协同用力。自评各阶段力量应区分主次，围绕自评主体推开，确保中心分明；各阶段自评计划应把好节点，聚焦自评总案统筹，确保有序推进；各阶段自评行动应突出重点，坚持问题指向，确保有效纠偏。三要常态闭合，全程用力。自评过程中，应注重发挥行政机关“随时在场和持续监督”的作用，常态自评、全程用力、持续抓好。 “示范区”式自评模式 部分院校机关与系室等基层单位在空间形态、功能布局上呈离散分布状态。如果自评模式选择不合理，容易造成标准不一、进度各异等局面。 该类型院校在组织自评时，可借鉴“示范区”式自评模式。即总校区以先行“示范区”为标杆，立点推面，规范自评方法路子，引领各分校独立开展自评。该模式集中优势力量打造“样板”，辐射带动整体自评展开。具体实施过程中，一要重视“示范区”选取的代表性。“示范区”在功能构成方面应尽量齐全，在学科布局方面应较为完善，在组织架构方面应相对完整，从而体现较强的代表性，能够以点带面，辐射推开。二要确定不同自评主体的关注重点。在打造“示范区”时，院校机关重在结合院校实际，关注自评流程的规范和标准的制定；示范单位重在结合自身实际，关注具体内容数据的确立与评估；其他分院重在以“示范区”为靶标，关注自评工作的组织与实施。三要做好自评关键环节的经验转化。抓好院校机关自评意图向“示范区”的转化，便于理解呈现；抓好“示范区”经验向各分校的转化，达成分区同频；抓好各分校自评问题向院校机关重点纠偏的转化，实现提质增效。 “聚光灯”式自评模式 不同类别的军队院校在办学思想、学科布局、教学方法、培育条件等方面有其专属特色，如果自评模式选择不合理，容易出现特色不鲜明、亮点不突出等问题。 面对这种情况，可借鉴“聚光灯”式自评模式。即以院校特色优势为“聚光点”，用特色之“线”牵引自评之“面”，达成强内涵、砺特色、促发展的目的。具体实施过程中，一要构设场景凝练特色优势。院校机关集聚全院专家开展“头脑风暴”，将教学建设与改革创新、质量保证与教学效果、跟踪机制与分析改进等共性指标，置于自身特色发展环境中予以再定义、再提炼、再充实，形成特色化评价体系框架。二要预设指标强化特色支撑。以“特色显示度、特色贡献度、特色支撑度、特色引领度、特色认可度”等为指标，细化框架纲目，实现特色优势由定性到定量的表达。三要组织自评突出特色衡量。采取“基本评价+特色评价”方式，基本评价围绕院校通用项目展开，重点评价特色支撑作用；特色评价围绕院校独有项目展开，重点评价独特性、创新性、发展性。 “第三方”式自评模式 部分军队院校之间以及军队院校与地方院校之间在学科设置、功能布局等方面，具有一定对应性、相近性和可借鉴性，如果自评模式选择不合理，容易出现责任主体既当“裁判员”又当“运动员”的现象，影响评估的权威性和客观性。 在这种情况下组织自评时，可借鉴“第三方”式自评模式。即按照“军队主导、地方参加”或“院内主导、院外参加”的原则，组建和依托独立于被评估对象之外的第三方组织实施评估。该模式集评价、监管、组织于一体，具有独立性、专业性、权威性等优势。具体实施过程中，一要突破思路，大胆创新。“第三方”式自评模式在军队院校实践较少，理论研究不够充分。参评院校要敢于尝试与突破，从实践中发展理论，用理论指导实践，推进“第三方”式自评健康发展。二要完善机制，激发动力。评估前建立“动力—保障”机制，评估中完善“沟通—协调”机制，评估后走通“应用—反馈—整改”机制，做实自评的“上篇文章”和“下篇文章”。三要借鉴经验，突出特点。军队院校借鉴引入“第三方”式自评模式时，要注重基于自身实际，确保自评的针对性。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118000346/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267141.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231116073628/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267141.html,2023-11-18 0:00:00,Creating a Self-Assessment Model that Meets the Practices of Military Colleges and Universities Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Yu Guoqiang Ren Fengchao Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-16 06:38:07 0,"Explore the innovation of self-evaluation mode of teaching ■ Yu Guoqiang Ren Fengchao Self-evaluation mode is a powerful lever for military colleges to carry out self-evaluation scientifically. Military colleges and universities should combine their own spatial patterns, functional layouts, specialty cultivation, and self-assessment team composition to create a self-assessment model that meets their own realities, in order to better promote the simplicity and efficiency of the self-assessment work. ""Rugby"" Self-Assessment Mode The organs and departments of some colleges and universities are centrally distributed in terms of spatial pattern and functional layout, and the dominant role of the center is prominent. However, if the self-assessment model is not reasonably chosen, it is easy to be too detailed and difficult for the grassroots to show their ""strengths"" and so on. This type of institutions in the organization of self-evaluation, can draw on the ""rugby"" self-evaluation mode. That is, at the beginning of the institutional organs as the main body of the outline of the framework, in the middle of the grass-roots units as the main force of classification and standardization, and in the latter part of the self-assessment experts as the backbone of the investigation, evaluation and supervision. The model of the two ends of the unity of the middle points, up and down the concerted efforts, guide and ease and to better mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the staff. Specific implementation process, a focus on the main responsibility, segmented force. Institutions in the unified outline of the framework, focus on finding the direction, positioning, unified ideas, avoid ""a pole in the end""; grass-roots level in the classification of standardization, focus on the intention to get accurate, the framework of the refinement of the standard, the standard to set up a real, avoid ""up and down the general thick""; expert group in the investigation and evaluation supervision When the expert group in the checking and evaluation supervision, to check to the key place, supervise to the problem, guide to the construction, avoid ""treating the symptoms but not the root cause"". Secondly, we should highlight the center of gravity and make concerted efforts. Self-assessment of the various stages of the force should be distinguished from the main and secondary, around the self-assessment of the main push to ensure that the center is clear; stages of self-assessment plan should be a good node, focusing on self-assessment of the overall case of integration to ensure that the orderly advancement of the stages of self-assessment action should be focused, adhere to the problem of pointing to ensure that the effective correction of bias. Thirdly, the normal closure, the whole force. Self-assessment process, should pay attention to play the role of administrative organs ""at any time present and continuous supervision"", regular self-assessment, the whole process of force, continue to grasp. Self-assessment mode of ""demonstration area"" Some institutions and departments and other grassroots units in the spatial form, functional layout of the discrete distribution state. If the self-assessment mode is not reasonably chosen, it will easily result in different standards and progress. When organizing self-evaluation, this type of institution can learn from the ""demonstration area"" self-evaluation mode. That is, the main campus to the first ""demonstration area"" as a benchmark, standing point to push the surface, standardize the self-assessment methodology, leading the branch campuses to carry out self-assessment independently. The model focuses on advantageous strength to create a ""model"", radiation drive the overall self-assessment unfolding. In the specific implementation process, we should pay attention to the representativeness of the ""model district"" selection. The ""demonstration area"" should be as complete as possible in terms of functional composition, should be more complete in terms of disciplinary layout, and should be relatively complete in terms of organizational structure, so as to reflect strong representativeness, and to be able to take the lead and spread the radiation. Second, to determine the focus of different self-assessment of the main body. In building the ""model district"", the institutional organs focus on combining the actual institutions, focusing on the standardization of the self-assessment process and the development of standards; the model unit focuses on combining its own actuality, focusing on the establishment and assessment of specific content data; other branches focus on the ""model district"" as the target Other branches focus on the ""model district"" as a target, focusing on the organization and implementation of the self-assessment work. Third, we should do a good job of self-evaluation of the key aspects of the transformation of experience. Grasp the self-evaluation intention of the institution to the ""model district"" transformation, easy to understand the presentation; grasp the ""model district"" experience to the transformation of the branch campuses, to achieve the same frequency in the sub-district; grasp the self-evaluation of the branch campuses to the institution to focus on correcting the transformation of the institution to improve the quality of the efficiency. ""Spotlight"" Self-Assessment Mode Different types of military colleges and universities have their own unique characteristics in terms of schooling ideology, discipline layout, teaching methods, and cultivation conditions, etc. If the self-assessment mode is not reasonably selected, it is easy to appear that the characteristics are not distinctive, and the highlights are not outstanding, and so on. In the face of this situation, we can learn from the ""spotlight"" self-assessment mode. That is, the characteristics of the institution's advantages as a ""spotlight"", with the characteristics of the ""line"" traction self-assessment of the ""surface"", to achieve a strong connotation, sharpening the characteristics, and promote the development of the purpose. In the specific implementation process, a scene should be set up to condense the characteristic advantages. Institutions gather experts to carry out ""brainstorming"", teaching construction and reform and innovation, quality assurance and teaching effectiveness, tracking mechanism and analysis and improvement of common indicators, placed in their own characteristics of the development of the environment to be redefined, re-refined, re-filled, the formation of the characteristics of the evaluation system framework. Second, we should preset indicators to strengthen the support of characteristics. Taking ""characteristic display degree, characteristic contribution degree, characteristic support degree, characteristic leading degree, characteristic recognition degree"" as indicators, we will refine the framework outline and realize the expression of characteristic advantages from qualitative to quantitative. Third, the organization should organize self-assessment to highlight the characteristics of measurement. Adopting the ""basic evaluation + feature evaluation"" approach, the basic evaluation around the institution's general projects, focusing on the evaluation of the characteristics of the support role; feature evaluation around the institution's unique projects, focusing on the evaluation of uniqueness, innovation, development. Third-party"" Self-evaluation Mode Some of the military colleges and universities, as well as military colleges and local colleges and universities, have a certain degree of correspondence, proximity, and reference in terms of discipline settings and functional layouts, etc. If the self-evaluation mode is not reasonably selected, it is easy for the responsible body to act as a ""referee"" and as a ""referee"". If the self-assessment mode is not chosen properly, it is easy to see the phenomenon that the responsible body acts as both ""referee"" and ""athlete"", which affects the authority and objectivity of the assessment. When organizing the self-assessment in this case, the ""third-party"" self-assessment model can be drawn upon. That is, in accordance with the principle of ""military-led, local participation"" or ""hospital-led, hospital participation"", the formation of and reliance on a third-party organization independent of the subject of the assessment to implement the assessment. This model integrates evaluation, supervision and organization, and has the advantages of independence, professionalism and authority. In the specific implementation process, a breakthrough idea, bold innovation. The ""third party"" self-assessment model is less practiced in military colleges and universities, and the theoretical research is not sufficient. Participating colleges and universities should dare to try and make breakthroughs, develop theories from practice, use theories to guide practice, and promote the healthy development of ""third-party"" self-assessment. Secondly, we should improve the mechanism to stimulate motivation. Before the assessment to establish a ""power - guarantee"" mechanism, the assessment to improve the ""communication - coordination"" mechanism, after the assessment to go through the ""application - feedback - rectification"" mechanism. Feedback - rectification"" mechanism, to do a solid self-assessment of the ""previous article"" and ""next article"". Third, we should learn from experience and highlight the characteristics. Military colleges and universities to draw on the introduction of ""third-party"" self-assessment mode, we should focus on their own reality, to ensure the relevance of self-assessment.","The article discusses the importance of creating a self-assessment model that meets the practices of military colleges and universities. It suggests using different self-assessment models such as the ""rugby,"" ""demonstration area,"" and ""third-party"" models to cater to the unique needs of each institution. The article also emphasizes the need to highlight the center of gravity, normalize the whole force, and do a good job of self-evaluation of the key aspects of the transformation of experience. Finally, it encourages military colleges and universities to learn from experience and create a self-assessment model that is relevant to their own realities."

As the decision-making and command center of the troops, the party committees at all levels should unswervingly lead the preparation for war as the first priority, focusing on the mission, targeting the strong enemy opponents to study the military to seek to win and grasp the preparation for war to train the elite, and to effectively promote the party's political advantage and organizational advantage into a winning advantage. Standing up the preparation for war and war command stick. Party committees at all levels are in a leading position in the construction of the army, playing a key role, has a comprehensive responsibility, and can not wait to promote the preparation for war is the mission of the system, the duty. The primary responsibility of the Party committee is to correct the center of gravity of the work, the direction of preparation for war, the overall situation and the major events, to ensure that all the energy to the war focus, all the work to the war effort, can not be distracted. The party committee's work guidance is to set up a clear direction, in the selection of personnel, incentives, rewards and punishments, resource allocation, publicity and public opinion to set up the wind vane to the war. The exemplary role of the party committee is to set up a demonstration benchmark, forge a war-type party committee team, cultivate war-type leading cadres, improve the preparation for war and war ""five capabilities"", crack the ""two capabilities are not enough"", ""five will not ""The problem of their own exemplary role to drive the officers and men to practice strong command ability, fighting skills, fighting style.

To actively adapt to the transformation of the base point of preparation for the military struggle, targeting the strong enemy opponents, from passive adaptation to the war to actively design the war transformation, shaping the security posture, curbing and controlling the crisis and conflict, and winning local wars. At present, the war form is accelerating to information technology intelligent evolution, war confrontation from the traditional physical domain development into a full-dimensional all-domain scramble, front and rear boundaries are broken, tangible and intangible battlefield full coverage. To keep an eye on the changes in science and technology, the changes in the war, the changes in the opponent, in-depth study of the trend of military change and the mechanism of war victory, to grasp the initiative of the war.

Practice good preparation for war, the key in the usual system to promote combat effectiveness construction, give play to the unique strengths of our army, make up the bottlenecks and short boards. To consolidate the basic combat power.

认真研究并加以把握运用，战争复杂系统的涌现性 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：刘海业  张阳  张德锋 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-16 06:32:49 0,涌现性：战争难以捉摸的一面 ■刘海业  张阳  张德锋 引 言 涌现性是复杂系统的基本特征之一。战争作为典型的复杂系统，其涌现性是战争各个要素不断自适应、交互、对抗和自组织的结果。战争复杂系统的涌现性，既能够让战争的进程难以掌控，又能够让战争的结局扑朔迷离，需要认真研究并加以把握运用。 认清战争复杂系统的涌现性 战争复杂系统的涌现性源自战争各要素的自适应和海量交互。根据复杂性科学理论，复杂系统内部的个体具有自适应、交互和自组织能力。正是通过不断的自适应和交互，大量个体的集体行为自组织演化出复杂、不断变化且难以预测的行为模式，并涌现出整体性质。 简单如动物界蜂群、蚁群的觅食等行为，再复杂一些如人类社会的战争活动，都遵从涌现性的基本模式，如同被一双看不见的手所支配。生物学中，当蜜蜂发现了一大片可以采蜜的花丛时会返回蜂巢跳一段“八字舞”，它的同伴能够根据舞蹈非常准确地获得花丛方向和距离，从而从整体上涌现出统一的蜂群觅食行为。人类的大脑可以看作是上千亿个神经元相互连接形成的网络，各个神经元虽然大小不等但是功能类似，使人类从整体上涌现出了高超的智慧和自我意识。未来联合作战，参与的要素将越来越丰富、多样和复杂。随着作战进程演进，各要素之间的交互将不是线性的规律性递增，极有可能是非线性的指数爆炸式增长。这将导致战争复杂系统的涌现更加频繁、更加出人意料。 战争复杂系统的涌现性随时随地可能发生且难以预测。“随时”是指涌现发生的时机难以预测，可能出现“意料之外、情理之中”的“黑天鹅”现象；“随地”则是指涌现发生的作战域难以控制，可能出现“力量整合、效果融合”的“跨域效应”。由于战争复杂系统的演化过程是一个各类因素海量交互、从高维向低维转变的过程，并且具有很强的随机性、不确定性，各类因素既会改变自己、也会改变环境。战场上“量变”何时何地转化为“质变”，绝非指挥员能够在战前“一厢情愿”地精准预测的。 科索沃战争中的“马桶效应”，非常值得世人从战争复杂系统涌现性的角度进行分析。1999年3月，科索沃战争爆发后，北约重点空袭了南联盟指挥中心、防空系统等重要军事目标，但收效甚微，南联盟民众抵抗意志并未减弱。自4月中旬开始，北约改变作战策略，将电力系统、供水系统等民用基础设施列入空袭范围。之后，南联盟普通民众抵抗意志开始变弱，甚至频频上街游行抗议执政当局。南联盟民众抵抗意志由强到弱的转变，一度让外界百思不得其解。后来，一位经济学教授分析得出其中一个重要原因：由于供水系统被北约摧毁，抽水马桶无法使用，习惯了现代文明的民众无法忍受臭气熏天的家居环境以及其他生活不便，抵抗意志逐渐削弱并最终被瓦解。战争复杂系统是一个规模庞大、关联紧密、交互频繁的整体，如同“马桶效应”一般，由于连锁反应引发的体系崩溃就是战场上常见的涌现性现象，并且随时随地可能出现。指挥员可以在战前确定作战目标，但“真枪实弹”的战局却难以被指挥员决定，其往往是在战争进程中通过敌我双方的激烈博弈演化出来的。 战争复杂系统的涌现性导致的结果具有非线性特征。涌现是战争复杂系统不断演化的结果，具有非线性特征。就像“蝴蝶效应”那样，南美洲亚马孙河流域热带雨林中的蝴蝶偶尔扇动几下翅膀，可以在两周以后引起美国得克萨斯州的一场龙卷风。在战争系统中，轻微的变化也可能会给战争进程和结局带来巨大影响，并且这些影响并非总是符合指挥员的主观意愿。特别是当战争复杂系统处于临界状态时，例如敌我双方战局错综复杂、态势攻守均衡、力量不相上下时，即使是随机、微小的突发扰动和事件，也往往对战局起到决定性作用。 英国有首著名的民谣：“少了一枚铁钉，掉了一只马掌；掉了一只马掌，丢了一匹战马；丢了一匹战马，败了一场战役；败了一场战役，丢了一个国家。”描述的就是在波斯沃斯战役中，国王理查三世的马掌少钉了一个铁钉，致使在冲锋时坠马被俘，进而招致军队失败的战例。这一战例充分体现了战争中敌我双方的某一行动、变化甚至疏忽，都可能经过逐级放大传导，涌现出严重影响战局的效果。信息化智能化作战，网络信息体系是联合作战体系的“黏合剂”“催化剂”，但并不是说只要有网络信息体系，就自然地让整个联合作战体系发挥出更好的效能。网络信息体系既能够将广域分布、功能形态异构的作战力量由松散个体聚合为整体，发挥“1+1>2”的“倍增器”作用；又可能由于网络信息体系关键节点遭到破坏、摧毁或控制，导致作战力量变成一盘散沙并被各个击破，产生“100-1=0”的“倍减器”恶果。 用好战争复杂系统的涌现性 近年来，随着建模仿真、人工智能、大数据等技术的不断进步，为指挥员把握控制战争复杂系统的涌现性提供了新的支撑。如果指挥员能够充分把握战争复杂系统的涌现性，就有可能先于对手感知、预见、利用甚至创造战争涌现的“点”，从而更加主动地塑造战争态势、创造制胜战机。 提前洞见涌现，先敌施变。战争复杂系统的涌现一旦发生，就可能使得整个战场全局或局部发生重大变化。“凡事预则立，不预则废”。只有先于对手感知、预见到可能发生涌现的战争体系关键节点、作战进程关键拐点，才能先敌施变，打乱对手的作战节奏。这就要求各级指挥员强化复杂系统思维，扎实落实战争准备的各项应对之策，提高练兵备战的针对性和预见性，才能有备无患。应积极应用建模仿真等能够洞见战争复杂系统涌现的方法，通过在虚拟战争空间中构建、还原与模拟真实作战环境、作战对手、作战行动与作战效果，更准确全面地感知未来战争战场态势，更高效更深刻地理解未来战争演变趋势。 顺势利用涌现，把握战机。成功洞见战争复杂系统的涌现之后，高明的指挥员会善于利用变幻莫测又转瞬即逝的涌现“点”，也就是作战中通常所说的“战机”，以雷霆万钧之势给对手以措手不及的打击。辽沈战役中，我东北野战军为聚歼廖耀湘20余万人的机械化重兵集团，在敌我兵力犬牙交错、战场态势瞬息万变的情况下，果断下达了“哪里有敌人就往哪里打”的命令，彻底打乱了敌人的防御部署，最终全歼该敌。在未来联合作战中，战机的出现将是秒级甚至毫秒级的，对于感知、决策和行动的速度要求，已经远远超过了人类的认知和反应极限。外军认为，人工智能技术将是辅助指挥员争夺电磁、网络等作战域的“力量倍增器”和“效能放大器”，能够实现战场态势动态感知、决策方案自主优化、对抗行动自动开展以及作战效果快速评估，极大提升指挥员组织指挥的精确性、实时性和针对性。 大胆创造涌现，以弱胜强。马克思主义战争观认为，战场上的“弱”和“强”是相对的。战场上兵力兵器处于弱势的一方，如若出奇招，照样可以战胜强手。这些招数将可能创造出强手难以预见又难以应对的战争复杂系统的涌现“点”，从而彻底地扭转战局。面对未来战争，必须充分发挥主观能动性，主动塑造有利态势，创造非对称的战机。一方面，从技术维度看，要充分认识到基础科学对于先进技术和装备研发的引领性、基础性作用，下大力气突破无形和有形的“壁垒”，在基础科学和先进技术领域铸造克敌制胜的“重剑”。另一方面，从作战维度看，剑胜于人，剑法更要高于人。要发挥在战略谋划、战略博弈方面的优势，研究创新适应未来战争的作战概念和战术战法，引领作战理念的发展方向和潮流，并大力提升战术和技术的结合度。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118000346/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267139.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231116073331/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267139.html,2023-11-18 0:00:00,Seriously study and grasp the use of the emergent nature of the complex system of war Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Liu Haiye Zhang Yang Zhang De Feng Responsibility: Yixi Ram 2023-11-16 06:32:49 0,"Emergence: The Elusive Side of War ■ Liu Haiye Zhang Yang Zhang De Feng Introduction Emergence is one of the basic characteristics of complex systems. As a typical complex system, the emergent nature of war is the result of continuous self-adaptation, interaction, confrontation and self-organization of various elements of war. The emergence of war complex system can make the process of war difficult to control, but also can make the end of war confusing, need to be carefully studied and grasp the use. Recognize the emergence of war complex system The emergence of war complex system comes from the self-adaptation and massive interaction of all elements of war. According to the theory of complexity science, the individuals within the complex system have the ability of self-adaptation, interaction and self-organization. It is through continuous self-adaptation and interaction that the collective behavior of a large number of individuals self-organizes to evolve complex, ever-changing and unpredictable behavioral patterns and emerges as a whole. Behaviors as simple as the foraging behavior of bee colonies and ant colonies in the animal kingdom, and as complex as the war activities of human societies, all follow the basic pattern of emergence, as if governed by a pair of invisible hands. In biology, when a bee discovers a large area of flowers where it can collect nectar, it will return to the hive and perform a ""figure of eight dance"", and its companions will be able to accurately obtain the direction and distance of the flowers according to the dance, thus creating a unified swarming foraging behavior from the overall emergence of the bee colony. The human brain can be regarded as a network of hundreds of billions of interconnected neurons, each of which is of different sizes but with similar functions, resulting in the emergence of a high level of intelligence and self-awareness of human beings as a whole. In future joint operations, the elements involved will be increasingly rich, diverse and complex. As the combat process evolves, the interaction between the elements will not be a linear regular increment, but most likely a non-linear exponential explosion. This will lead to more frequent and unexpected emergence of complex systems of war. The emergence of complex systems of war can happen anywhere, anytime and is difficult to predict. ""At any time"" refers to the emergence of the timing is difficult to predict, there may be ""unexpected, reasonable"" of the ""black swan"" phenomenon; ""anywhere The ""anywhere"" refers to the emergence of the operational domain is difficult to control, there may be ""integration of forces, the effect of integration"" of the ""cross-domain effect"". As the evolution of the complex system of war is a process of massive interaction of various types of factors, from high-dimensional to low-dimensional transformation process, and has a strong degree of randomness, uncertainty, various types of factors will change themselves, but also change the environment. The battlefield ""quantitative change"" when and where to transform into ""qualitative change"", by no means the commander can be in the pre-war ""wishful thinking"" to accurately predict. The ""toilet effect"" in the Kosovo war is very worthwhile for the world to analyze from the perspective of the emergence of the complex system of war. 1999 March, after the outbreak of the Kosovo war, NATO focused on air strikes on the command center of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the air defense system and other important military targets, but the results were very little, and the will of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia people to resist did not diminish. Since mid-April, NATO has changed its operational strategy to include power systems, water supply systems and other civilian infrastructure in the scope of air strikes. After that, the will of resistance of the general public of the FRY began to weaken, and even frequently took to the streets to protest against the ruling authorities. The change from strong to weak will of resistance of the people of the FRY was once puzzling to the outside world. Later, a professor of economics analyzed and came up with one of the important reasons: due to the destruction of the water supply system by NATO, flush toilets could not be used, and the people accustomed to the modern civilization could not tolerate the smelly home environment and other inconveniences of life, and the will of resistance was gradually weakened and finally disintegrated. The complex system of war is a large-scale, closely related, frequently interacting whole, like the ""toilet effect"", the system collapse due to chain reaction is a common emergent phenomenon on the battlefield, and may occur at any time and any place. Commanders can determine the combat objectives before the war, but the ""real"" battlefield is difficult to be decided by the commanders, which is often in the process of the war through the fierce game of the enemy and our evolution. The emergence of the complex system of war leads to the results of non-linear characteristics. Emergence is the result of the continuous evolution of the complex system of war, with non-linear characteristics. Just like the ""butterfly effect"", a butterfly in the rainforest of the Amazon River basin in South America occasionally flaps its wings a few times, which can cause a tornado in Texas in the United States two weeks later. In war systems, slight changes can also have a huge impact on the course and outcome of a war, and these impacts are not always in line with the subjective wishes of the commanders. Especially when the complex system of war is in a critical state, for example, when the battlefield between the enemy and us is intricate and complex, the posture is balanced between offense and defense, and the forces are not comparable, even random and tiny sudden disturbances and events often play a decisive role in the battlefield. There is a famous ballad in England: ""A nail is missing, a horse's paw is lost; a horse's paw is lost, a war horse is lost; a war horse is lost, a battle is lost; a battle is lost, a country is lost."" The description is in the Battle of Bosworth, King Richard III's horse paw missing a nail, resulting in the charge fell off the horse was captured, and then incurred the defeat of the army's war case. This example fully embodies the war on both sides of the enemy, a certain action, change or even negligence, may be amplified through the level by level conduction, emergence of a serious impact on the battlefield effect. Informatization intelligent combat, network information system is the joint operation system ""adhesive"" ""catalyst"", but not that as long as there is a network information system, naturally let the whole joint operation system to play a better performance. Network information system can not only the wide distribution, functional form of heterogeneous combat forces by the loose individual aggregation as a whole, play ""1 +1 > 2"" of the ""multiplier"" role; but also may be due to the network information system key nodes have been damaged, destroyed or control, resulting in the combat forces into a scattered plate. Lead to combat forces into a scattered and broken, resulting in ""100-1 = 0"" ""multiplier and reducer"" of the bad results. Use the emergence of war complex system In recent years, with the modeling simulation, artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies continue to progress, for the commander to grasp the control of war complex system emergence provides new support. If the commander can fully grasp the emergence of the complex system of war, it is possible to perceive, foresee, utilize and even create the emergence of the war ""point"" before the opponent, so as to more proactively shape the war situation and create a winning opportunity. Early insight into the emergence of the first enemy to apply changes. Once the emergence of the complex system of war occurs, it may make the whole battlefield global or local major changes. ""Everything in advance is established, not in advance is abolished."" Only by perceiving and foreseeing the key nodes of the war system and key inflection points of the combat process that may occur before the opponent, can the enemy apply changes first and disrupt the opponent's combat rhythm. This requires commanders at all levels to strengthen the complex system thinking, the solid implementation of the war preparations for the response to the measures to improve the relevance and predictability of training and preparation for war, in order to be prepared for any problems. Should actively apply modeling simulation and other methods that can see the emergence of complex systems of war, through the virtual war space to build, restore and simulate the real combat environment, combat opponents, combat operations and combat effects, a more accurate and comprehensive perception of the future war battlefield situation, a more efficient and deeper understanding of the future evolution of the trend of war. Utilize the emergence of the trend to grasp the war opportunities. After successful insight into the emergence of the complex system of war, smart commanders will make good use of the unpredictable and fleeting emergence of the ""point"", which is also commonly referred to as ""war opportunities"" in the operation, to give the opponent a thunderous momentum to the surprise of the blow. In the Liao-Shen Battle, my Northeast Field Army, in order to annihilate Liao Yaoxiang's mechanized heavy group of more than 200,000 people, decisively issued the order of ""where there is an enemy, where to fight"" in the face of the rapidly changing battlefield situation, completely disrupting the enemy's defense deployment, and ultimately annihilating the enemy. In the future joint operation, the emergence of warplanes will be seconds or even milliseconds, for the perception, decision-making and action speed requirements, has far exceeded the limits of human cognition and reaction. Foreign forces believe that artificial intelligence technology will be a ""force multiplier"" and ""performance amplifier"" to assist commanders to compete in electromagnetic, network and other combat domains, which can realize dynamic perception of the battlefield situation, autonomous optimization of decision-making programs, automatic development of confrontation operations and rapid assessment of combat effects, and greatly enhance the commander's organizational and operational capabilities. It can realize dynamic perception of battlefield situation, autonomous optimization of decision-making scheme, automatic development of confrontation operation, and rapid assessment of combat effect, and greatly enhance the accuracy, real-time and pertinence of commanders' organization and command. Bold creativity emerges to win with weakness. According to the Marxist view of war, ""weak"" and ""strong"" on the battlefield are relative. Battlefield force weapons in the weaker party, such as if out of the strange tricks, but also can win over the strong hand. These tricks will be able to create a strong hand is difficult to foresee and difficult to deal with the emergence of the complex system of war ""point"", so as to completely reverse the war situation. In the face of future war, we must give full play to subjective initiative, take the initiative to shape a favorable situation, creating asymmetric war opportunities. On the one hand, from the technical dimension, to fully recognize the basic science for advanced technology and equipment development of the leading, fundamental role, make great efforts to break through the intangible and tangible ""barriers"" in the field of basic science and advanced technology casting victory over the enemy's ""heavy sword! ""On the other hand, from the perspective of combat dimension, we should make great efforts to break through invisible and tangible barriers. On the other hand, from the dimension of combat, the sword is better than people, the sword should be higher than people. We should give full play to our strengths in strategic planning and strategic gaming, research and innovate operational concepts and tactics to adapt to future wars, lead the development of operational concepts and trends, and vigorously enhance the combination of tactics and technology.","The complex system of war is an emergent characteristic of complex systems. The article discusses the importance of understanding and utilizing the emergence of the war system, as it can make the process of war unpredictable and difficult to control.

学习有理丨“第二个结合”的思想内涵和时代意义 来源：潮新闻 作者：浙江省习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-20 17:13:46 0,6月2日，中共中央总书记、国家主席、中央军委主席习近平在北京出席文化传承发展座谈会并发表重要讲话。新华社记者 王晔 摄 习近平文化思想是新时代党领导文化建设实践经验的理论总结，其中关于“第二个结合”的观点，既具有深刻的思想内涵，又具有伟大的时代意义，既具有深厚的历史渊源，又是巨大的理论创新，推动了马克思主义中国化时代化的新发展，是对中华文明发展规律的深刻把握。 马克思主义和中华优秀传统文化高度契合 习近平总书记在庆祝中国共产党成立100周年大会上的讲话中，首次提出“两个结合”的概念。他强调，新的征程上，我们必须“坚持把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合，用马克思主义观察时代、把握时代、引领时代，继续发展当代中国马克思主义、21世纪马克思主义”。这意味着，中国共产党在长期坚持的“把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合”的基础上，又提出“第二个结合”，即“同中华优秀传统文化相结合”。 “结合”的前提是彼此契合，马克思主义和中华优秀传统文化来源不同，但彼此存在高度的契合性。习近平总书记指出，马克思主义传入中国后，科学社会主义的主张受到中国人民热烈欢迎，并最终扎根中国大地、开花结果，决不是偶然的，而是同我国传承了几千年的优秀历史文化和广大人民日用而不觉的价值观念融通的。马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》德文版序言中申明，这些原理的实际运用，正如《宣言》中所说的，随时随地都要以当时的历史条件为转移。“当时的历史条件”除国情世情之外，也包括不同民族文化的各自特征。制度理论的选择一定要考虑到不同文化的内在差异，才能最大限度地展示出真理的力量。要将马克思主义理论成果聚变为现实优势，融入人民日用而不觉的思想观念，就要与本国优秀传统文化有机结合。 中华优秀传统文化强调“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”“修身齐家治国平天下”等等，主张追求天下为公、天下大同的社会理想，推行民为邦本、为政以德的治理观念，高度契合中国共产党人强烈的时代担当、为民谋福祉的家国情怀和敢教日月换新天的政治自觉。这同科学社会主义基本原则内在一致——力求建立没有剥削压迫，各尽所能，按需分配的理想共同体。中华优秀传统文化充实了马克思主义的文化生命，赋予中国特色社会主义以深厚的文化底蕴和理论内涵。 在民本关系上，中华优秀传统文化体现富民厚生、义利兼顾的人本思想，主张“以民为本、厚民之本、固国之宁”“视民为重、国之社稷次之、君之位次之”，强调治国的基础是“以民为本”。中国共产党继承了传统民本思想的精华，并对传统民本思想进行了创造性转化和创新性发展，树立了“全心全意为人民服务”的根本宗旨、“以人民为中心”的发展思想。正因为中国共产党在执政实践中始终坚持以民为本，才得到了人民群众的坚定支持和衷心拥护，才汇聚起全国各族人民的力量，取得了社会主义现代化建设的伟大成就。 在自我修养上，中华优秀传统文化主张追求厚德载物、明德弘道的高尚品格，秉承讲信修睦、亲仁善邻的处世之道。追求“厚德者不孤，必有其邻”的和气，“天行健，君子以自强不息”的骨气，“和而不同”“君子喻义”的义气等等。这些传统美德和人格修养与马克思主义关于人的全面发展思想存在契合之处，在社会主义核心价值观中得到充分体现，成为武装全党、教育人民的重要原则。 中国特色社会主义道路，是在马克思主义指导下走出来的，也是从五千多年中华文明史中走出来的。中华优秀传统文化对社会主义道路的选择起到重要影响，如“故人不独亲其亲，不独子其子。使老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者终有所养，男有分，女有归”的目标理想与共产主义社会特征高度契合，决定中国必然选择走社会主义道路。中国共产党以马克思主义为指导对中华五千多年文明宝库进行全面挖掘，用马克思主义激活中华优秀传统文化中富有生命力的优秀因子并赋予新的时代内涵，将“民为邦本”升华为“以人民为中心”，将“不患寡而患不均”凝练为共同富裕的发展思想等。 党对“第二个结合”认识的不断深化 习近平总书记指出，回顾党的百年奋斗史，我们党之所以能够在革命、建设、改革各个历史时期取得重大成就，能够领导人民完成中国其他政治力量不可能完成的艰巨任务，根本在于掌握了马克思主义科学理论，并不断结合新的实际推进理论创新，使党掌握了强大的真理力量。中国共产党是马克思主义的坚定信仰者和实践者，也是中华优秀传统文化的忠实传承者和弘扬者，始终决不抛弃马克思主义这个魂脉，决不抛弃中华优秀传统文化这个根脉，把坚守好这个魂和根作为理论创新的基础和前提，始终将中华民族的伟大精神和丰富智慧更深层次地注入马克思主义，有效地把马克思主义思想精髓同中华优秀传统文化精华贯通起来，以中华优秀传统文化为依托不断开辟马克思主义中国化时代化新境界。 早在新民主主义革命时期，毛泽东就深刻认识到“必须将马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践完全恰当地统一起来，就是说，和民族的特点相结合，经过一定的民族形式，才有用处”。要取得革命的胜利，就要推进马克思主义的中国化，“使之在其每一表现中带着中国的特性，即是说，按照中国的特点去应用它”。民族的文化传统是现实社会的一部分，是时代现状在观念上的隐性表达，这里的“民族形式”“中国的特点”内在包含中华民族的精神特质与文化理念。因而，毛泽东将知行合一同马克思主义的实践取向概括为实事求是，将万物相生相克思想同对立统一规律有机结合，将大同社会与共产主义理想主张价值融通，实现了马克思主义中国化的第一次飞跃。 党的十一届三中全会以后，中国共产党继续深化对马克思主义中国化的正确认识，在党的十二大提出要“把马克思主义的普遍真理同我国的具体实际结合起来，走自己的道路”，并不断从中华优秀传统文化中汲取智慧力量。例如“小康社会”的提出，取自“民亦劳止，汔可小康”，以古代人民对美好社会的愿景理想作为社会主义建设的阶段性目标；“以人为本”取自“民为邦本，本固邦宁”，以传统理念作为党执政为民的核心指向，在改革开放与社会主义现代化建设时期实现马克思主义中国化的第二次飞跃。 进入新时代，以习近平同志为核心的党中央总结历史经验，更加充分认识到“第二个结合”是从深厚的历史逻辑中得出的历史应然。在庆祝中国共产党成立100周年大会上，习近平总书记首次明确提出“坚持把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合”。在文化传承发展座谈会上，习近平总书记指出：“在五千多年中华文明深厚基础上开辟和发展中国特色社会主义，把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际、同中华优秀传统文化相结合是必由之路”，“是我们在探索中国特色社会主义道路中得出的规律性的认识，是我们取得成功的最大法宝。”随后的全国宣传思想文化工作会议正式提出习近平文化思想。习近平文化思想以“第二个结合”为重要方法之一，在文化理论观点与文化工作布局上做到了明体达用、体用贯通，标志着党对马克思主义与中华优秀传统文化关系的理解达到新境界，对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的认识达到新高度。 “第二个结合”助力建设中华民族现代文明 习近平总书记指出“第二个结合”，是我们党对马克思主义中国化时代化历史经验的深刻总结，是对中华文明发展规律的深刻把握，表明我们党对中国道路、理论、制度的认识达到了新高度，表明我们党的历史自信、文化自信达到了新高度，表明我们党在传承中华优秀传统文化中推进文化创新的自觉性达到了新高度。“第二个结合”对推动中华优秀传统文化实现创造性转化、创新性发展，建设中华民族现代文明起到重要作用。 “第二个结合”能够巩固文化主体，打开创新空间。近代中国国家蒙辱、人民蒙难、文明蒙尘，社会上历史虚无主义、文化虚无主义盛行。应当承认数千年的文明发展史，不可避免会受到当时人们认识水平、时代条件、社会制度等的局限性的制约和影响，因而不可避免地会存在陈旧过时的东西。这就要求人们在学习、研究、运用传统文化时要结合新的实践和时代要求进行正确取舍，在继承中发展，在发展中继承。实现民族独立、国家富强的基本前提是坚定文化自信。正如习近平总书记所说，文化自信是更基本、更深沉、更持久的力量。历史和现实都表明，一个抛弃了或者背叛了自己历史文化的民族，不仅不可能发展起来，而且很可能上演一场历史悲剧。“第二个结合”坚定了文化自信，巩固了文化主体，打开了创新空间，让我们能够在更广阔的文化空间中，充分运用中华优秀传统文化的宝贵资源，探索面向未来的理论和制度创新。 “第二个结合”让中华文明与马克思主义相互成就，共同焕发出新的时代光彩。马克思主义以真理之光激活了中华文明的基因，让中华民族实现从传统到现代的飞跃，推动中华文明实现发展更新与文化转型，形成既具备马克思主义科学内涵的理论体系，又拥有中华文明丰厚底蕴的新的文化生命体。同时，中华优秀传统文化为马克思主义提供丰厚文化滋养，充实了马克思主义的文化生命，让中国化时代化的马克思主义彰显出鲜明的中国风格与中国气派，成为中华文化和中国精神的时代精华与改变世界的理论武器。此外，“第二个结合”有助于推动中国式现代化，为建设中华民族现代文明提供方法指引。中华文明赋予中国式现代化以深厚的文化底蕴与价值积淀，中国式现代化赋予中华文明以旺盛生命力，让中华文明在21世纪成为中国式现代化的文化形态。 “第二个结合”是马克思主义中国化时代化的伟大成果，表明我们党对在传承中华优秀传统文化中推进理论创新的自觉性达到了新高度，同时也是又一次的思想解放，对全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴具有深远的指导意义，是建设中华民族现代文明的重要路径之一。深入学习习近平文化思想，就要深刻理解“第二个结合”的思想内涵和时代意义，在着力赓续中华文脉、推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化和创新性发展的基础上，不断开辟马克思主义中国化时代化新境界。 【执笔人：韩喜平、杨羽川，特约研究员，分别为吉林大学党委副书记、吉林大学马克思主义学院东北民族研究中心研究员】,https://web.archive.org/web/20231120235713/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267955.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231120134810/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16267955.html,2023-11-21 0:00:00,"Learning is reasonable丨The ideological connotation and contemporary significance of the ""second combination"" Source: Chao News Author: Zhejiang Xi Jinping Research Center for Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era Responsibility: Li Jiaqi 2023-11-20 17:13:46 0","On June 2, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, president of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), attended a symposium on the development of cultural heritage in Beijing and delivered an important speech. Xi Jinping's cultural thought is a theoretical summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction in the new era, in which the idea of ""the second combination"" has both profound ideological connotations and great significance for the times, and has both deep historical origins and great theoretical innovations, which has pushed forward the new development of the Chineseization of Marxism and the modernization of Chinese civilization. The new development of epochalization is a profound grasp of the law of development of Chinese civilization. Marxism and Chinese traditional culture are highly compatible with each other. In his speech at the 100th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward the concept of ""two combinations"" for the first time. He emphasized that on the new journey, we must ""insist on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture, use Marxism to observe the times, grasp the times, and lead the times, and continue to develop contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century Marxism"". This means that on the basis of the CPC's long-held principle of ""combining the basic principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China"", the CPC has put forward a ""second combination"", i.e., ""combining it with the excellent traditional Chinese culture"". The second combination is ""combining with the excellent traditional Chinese culture"". The prerequisite for ""combination"" is mutual compatibility. Marxism and Chinese traditional culture have different origins, but they are highly compatible with each other. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that after Marxism was introduced to China, the idea of scientific socialism was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and eventually took root and blossomed on the Chinese soil, not by chance, but by integration with the excellent historical culture inherited by our country for thousands of years and the values that the general public uses daily without realizing it. In the preface to the German edition of the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels affirmed that the practical application of these principles, as stated in the Manifesto, is at all times subject to the historical conditions of the time. The ""prevailing historical conditions"" include, in addition to national and world conditions, the individual characteristics of different national cultures. The choice of institutional theory must take into account the inherent differences of different cultures in order to maximize the power of truth. In order to transform the theoretical achievements of Marxism into practical advantages and integrate them into the people's daily use without realizing it, it is necessary to combine them with the excellent traditional culture of the country. The excellent traditional Chinese culture emphasizes that ""the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of the man"", ""cultivate oneself, keep the family in order, rule the country and pacify the world"", etc., advocates the pursuit of the social ideal of the world for the common good and the world's commonwealth, and promotes the concept of governance of the people for the state as the basis, and governance based on morality, which is highly in line with the strong sense of responsibility of the times, and the spirit of the CPC. This is highly in line with the Chinese Communist Party's strong commitment to the times, its family and national sentiment of seeking the well-being of the people, and its political self-awareness of daring to teach the sun and the moon to change the sky and the moon to a new day. This is inherently consistent with the basic principles of scientific socialism, which seeks to establish an ideal community free of exploitation and oppression, in which each person can do his or her best and distribution is made according to needs. The excellent traditional Chinese culture enriches the cultural life of Marxism and gives socialism with Chinese characteristics a profound cultural background and theoretical connotation. In terms of people-oriented relations, the excellent traditional Chinese culture embodies the people-oriented ideology of enriching the people and taking into account both righteousness and benefit, advocating that ""the people should be the foundation of the people, the foundation of the people should be thick, and the peace of the country should be solidified"", ""the people should be the most important thing, the country's altars of grain and grain should come second, and the position of the ruler should come second"", and emphasizing that the basis of the rule of the country is to emphasizing that the basis of governance is ""people-oriented"". The CPC has inherited the essence of the traditional people-oriented thinking and has carried out creative transformation and innovative development of the traditional people-oriented thinking, setting up the fundamental purpose of ""serving the people wholeheartedly"" and the development idea of ""people-centeredness"". It is precisely because the CPC has always adhered to the people-centered approach in its governing practice that it has gained the firm support and heartfelt embrace of the people, and brought together the strength of people of all ethnic groups across the country to achieve the great achievements of socialist modernization. In terms of self-cultivation, the excellent traditional Chinese culture advocates the pursuit of the noble character of being virtuous and virtuous, adhering to the way of dealing with the world by preaching faith, cultivating harmony, and being kind and good to one's neighbors. The pursuit of ""virtue is not alone, there will be its neighbors"" of harmony, ""Tian Xing Jian, gentleman to self-improvement,"" the backbone, ""and different,"" ""gentleman metaphors righteousness ""The spirit of righteousness and so on. These traditional virtues and character cultivation have a fit with the Marxist ideology of the comprehensive development of human beings, which is fully embodied in the socialist core values and has become an important principle for arming the whole Party and educating the people. The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is developed under the guidance of Marxism and from the history of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization. The excellent traditional Chinese culture has played an important role in influencing the choice of the road to socialism, for example, ""Therefore, a person does not only kiss his relatives, but also does not only give birth to his children. The goal and ideal of ""making the elderly have an end, the strong have a use for them, the young have a place to grow up, widows and widowers, orphans and invalids have a place to live, men have a share, and women have a place to return to"" is highly compatible with the characteristics of a communist society, and determines China's inevitable choice of the socialist road. The CPC, guided by Marxism, has conducted a comprehensive excavation of the treasure trove of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, used Marxism to activate the vitality of the outstanding factors of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and give them new connotations for the times, sublimated ""the people as the basis of the state"" to ""people-oriented"", sublimated ""people-oriented"" to ""people-oriented"" and ""people-oriented"" to ""people-oriented"", and gave new meaning to ""people-oriented"". The Party has sublimated ""the people are the foundation of the country"" into ""people-centeredness"", and has condensed the concept of ""not suffering from scarcity but from uneven distribution"" into the idea of development of common wealth, and so on. The Party's deepening of its understanding of the ""second combination"" has led General Secretary Xi Jinping to point out that, looking back on the Party's century-long history of struggle, the reason why the Party has been able to make significant achievements in the various historical periods of revolution, construction, and reform, and has been able to lead the people in accomplishing arduous tasks that were impossible for any other political force in China, lies in the fact that it has mastered the scientific theory of Marxism and has constantly combined it with new practical theories and theories. theory, and constantly advancing theoretical innovation in the light of new realities, so that the Party has mastered the powerful force of truth. The CPC is a firm believer in and practitioner of Marxism, and a faithful inheritor and promoter of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and has always never abandoned the soul and vein of Marxism and the root of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and has taken the firm adherence to this soul and root as the basis and prerequisite for theoretical innovations, and has always infused the great spirit and rich wisdom of the Chinese nation more deeply into Marxism, effectively bringing the essence of Marxist thought to the forefront of Chinese society. We have always injected the great spirit and rich wisdom of the Chinese nation into Marxism at a deeper level, effectively connected the essence of Marxist thought with the essence of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and constantly opened up new horizons of the Chineseization of Marxism as well as the modernization of the Chinese culture on the basis of the excellent traditional Chinese culture. As early as during the New Democratic Revolution, Mao Zedong profoundly realized that ""the universal truth of Marxism and the concrete practice of the Chinese Revolution must be completely and properly united, that is to say, combined with the characteristics of the nation, and through a certain national form, before they can be of any use"". To achieve victory in the revolution, it is necessary to promote the Chineseization of Marxism, ""so that it carries with it Chinese characteristics in every one of its manifestations, that is to say, to apply it in accordance with Chinese characteristics."" The cultural traditions of the nation are part of the real society, and are the implicit expression of the current situation of the times, and the ""national form"" and ""Chinese characteristics"" here inherently contain the spiritual qualities and cultural concepts of the Chinese nation. Therefore, Mao Zedong summarized the unity of knowledge and action with the practical orientation of Marxism as seeking truth from facts, organically combined the idea of the unity of opposites with the law of unity of opposites, and integrated the value of the commonwealth society with the ideal claim of communism, thus realizing the first leap in the Chineseization of Marxism. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC continued to deepen its correct understanding of the Chineseization of Marxism, and at the Twelfth National Congress of the CPC, it proposed to ""combine the universal truths of Marxism with the concrete realities of our country, and take our own path"", and constantly drew wisdom and strength from the excellent traditional Chinese culture. For example, ""moderately affluent society"" is taken from ""the people are also laboring to stop, the car can be well-off"", to the ancient people's vision of a better society as a milestone in the construction of socialism; ""people-oriented"" is taken from ""people-oriented"", which means ""the people are the most important thing"". ""People-oriented"" is taken from ""the people are the foundation of the state, the foundation is solid and the state is peaceful"", taking the traditional concept as the core point of the party's governance for the people, and realizing the second leap of the Chineseization of Marxism in the period of reform and opening up and socialist modernization. Entering the new era, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has summed up its historical experience and more fully realized that the ""second combination"" is a historical necessity derived from a profound historical logic. At the conference celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), General Secretary Xi Jinping for the first time explicitly put forward the idea of ""insisting on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities, and combining them with China's outstanding traditional culture"". At the Symposium on Cultural Heritage and Development, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""to open up and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics on the basis of the profound foundation of more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's excellent traditional culture is a necessary path,"" and that ""this is the rule we have drawn from exploring the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics. The regular understanding we have reached in exploring the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the greatest magic weapon for our success."" Xi Jinping's cultural thought was formally put forward at the subsequent National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology and Culture. With the ""second combination"" as one of the key methods, Xi's cultural thought has achieved a clear understanding of the body and the use of the body and the use of the body and the use of the body in the theoretical viewpoints of culture and the layout of cultural work, marking the Party's understanding of the relationship between Marxism and the excellent traditional culture of China to reach a new level, and the understanding of the laws of the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics to reach a new height. The ""second combination"" will help build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the ""second combination"" is a profound summary of the Party's historical experience of the Chineseization of Marxism and a profound grasp of the laws governing the development of Chinese civilization, indicating that the Party's understanding of China's path, theory and system has reached a new level. It shows that our Party's understanding of China's roads, theories and systems has reached a new height, that our Party's historical and cultural confidence has reached a new height, and that our Party's self-consciousness of promoting cultural innovation in inheriting the excellent traditional Chinese culture has reached a new height. The ""second combination"" plays an important role in promoting the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture and building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. The ""second combination"" can consolidate the main body of culture and open up space for innovation. In modern China, the country has been humiliated, the people have suffered, and the civilization is in the dust. Historical nihilism and cultural nihilism are prevalent in the society. It should be admitted that thousands of years of civilization development history will inevitably be constrained and influenced by the limitations of people's level of understanding, the conditions of the times, and the social system at that time, and thus there will inevitably be old and outdated things. This requires people to make correct choices when studying, researching and applying traditional culture in the light of new practices and the requirements of the times, so as to develop in the course of inheritance and inheritance in the course of development. The basic prerequisite for realizing national independence and national prosperity is firm cultural confidence. As General Secretary Xi Jinping said, cultural self-confidence is a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring force. History and reality have shown that a nation that abandons or betrays its own history and culture is not only unlikely to develop, but is also likely to stage a historical tragedy. The ""second combination"" strengthens cultural self-confidence, consolidates the main body of culture, and opens up space for innovation, allowing us to fully utilize the valuable resources of the excellent traditional Chinese culture in a broader cultural space, and explore future-oriented theoretical and institutional innovations. ""The second combination allows Chinese civilization and Marxism to achieve mutual success and shine together in a new era. Marxism has activated the genes of Chinese civilization with the light of truth, enabling the Chinese nation to make a leap from tradition to modernity, and pushing Chinese civilization to realize development and cultural transformation, forming a new cultural organism with both the theoretical system of Marxism's scientific connotation and the rich heritage of Chinese civilization. At the same time, the excellent traditional Chinese culture provides abundant cultural nourishment for Marxism, enriching the cultural life of Marxism, and allowing the Chineseized and modernized Marxism to manifest its distinctive Chinese style and Chinese style, and to become the essence of the Chinese culture and spirit of the times as well as a theoretical weapon for changing the world. In addition, the ""second combination"" will help promote Chinese-style modernization and provide methodological guidance for building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. Chinese civilization gives Chinese-style modernization a deep cultural heritage and value accumulation, and Chinese-style modernization gives Chinese civilization a vigorous vitality, so that Chinese civilization can become the cultural form of Chinese-style modernization in the 21st century. The ""second combination"" is a great achievement of the modernization of Marxism, indicating that our Party has reached a new height of self-consciousness about promoting theoretical innovation in the inheritance of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and at the same time, it is another ideological liberation, which has a far-reaching guiding significance, and is one of the important paths for building the modern civilization of the Chinese nation. In-depth study of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, it is necessary to deeply understand the ideological connotation and contemporary significance of the ""second combination"", and constantly open up new horizons for the modernization of Chinese Marxism based on efforts to continue the Chinese cultural lineage and promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture. [Written by Han Xiping and Yang Yuchuan, contributing researchers, respectively deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Jilin University and researcher at the Northeast Ethnic Studies Center, School of Marxism, Jilin University].","The article discusses the concept of ""the second combination,"" a theoretical summary proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, which emphasizes the combination of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture. This combination is seen as essential for the development of the Chinese-style modernization and the fostering of a new cultural organism that integrates the scientific connotations of Marxism with the rich heritage of Chinese civilization. The article highlights how the ""second combination"" has been put forth by the Party, making it a significant method for building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. In the process, the article recognizes the impact of Marxism in activating the genes of Chinese civilization with the light of truth, enabling the Chinese nation to leap from tradition to modernity, while also praising the roles the excellent traditional Chinese culture has played in enriching the cultural life of Marxism and promoting its Chinese style and spirit."
带兵人帮助战士成长的重要责任——助力成长 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：徐弘源  胡  静 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-23 06:44:23 0,助力成长是带兵人重要责任 ■徐弘源  胡  静 ●助力成长的前提是知兵爱兵、关键是一视同仁、途径是岗位锻炼 前不久，笔者所在连队一名曾有退伍意愿的战士，不仅改变了想法，顺利完成军士选晋，还在旅队组织的比武竞赛中创造了打破纪录的成绩。这件事引发笔者思考一个现实话题：作为带兵人，面对“网生代”战士，如何不负组织信任把他们带好，帮助他们成长？这是新时代强军兴军事业的需要，也是每一名基层带兵人的重要责任。 助力成长的前提是知兵爱兵。当前，官兵关系出现一些新情况，比如，有的带兵人对战士“不远不近也不亲，不打不骂也不爱”；有的单位“干部一个圈、战士一个圈”；有的战士与网友交流多、与战友交流少，和战友成了“熟悉的陌生人”；等等。这些问题都不同程度影响着官兵关系，制约着战斗力的提升。由于这些问题的存在，帮助官兵成长便无从谈起。究其原因，从带兵人角度讲，是知兵没有知到根底上，爱兵没有爱到心坎里。知是爱之基，爱是知之本。知兵爱兵是密切官兵关系的基础，是帮助战士成长的前提。带兵人知兵爱兵，战士才愿意真正把你视为兄长，有话才愿意跟你讲，有需求才愿意请你出主意，才能对战士帮助到点子上。知兵，不仅要清楚地掌握每名战士的家庭籍贯、年龄学历、性格特点等，还要对其婚恋情况、所愿所盼了如指掌；爱兵，既要关心战士身体伤病、吃穿住用，更要关注其思想状况、情绪变化，要把战士的操心事、揪心事、烦心事当作自己的事，像良师那样关心他们成长，像兄长那样关心他们生活，引之以路径，教之以方法，让他们安心干好本职工作，心无旁骛练兵备战。 助力成长的关键是一视同仁。战士的能力有高低、认知有不同，这是带兵人无法回避的现实问题。有的战士能力素质较好、适应速度较快，在连队很快崭露头角，对这样的战士，带兵人往往会高看一眼、厚爱一分。相反，对那些表现中规中矩甚至有些落后的战士往往关注不够、关心不多。有的带兵人认为，抓前头能够争荣誉、抓后头容易出成绩，往往对抓中间重视不够，不愿花力气。殊不知，帮助这部分战士找到适合自己的发展路径，让他们快速成长起来，连队建设才会有质的飞跃。战士来到军营后，大都希望锻炼自己，渴望成才、获得荣誉。而不拔尖的战士因为容易被忽略，所以对“公平”往往看得更重，也更想被关注、被认可、被需要。因而，基层带兵人在帮助战士成长上，须着力克服功利思想，不搞厚此薄彼，力求做到“一碗水端平”，不论能力强弱、水平高低、性格如何，对战士都秉持一视同仁态度，伸出帮扶之手，尽好育人之责。只有这样，才能提升全体战士的归属感、荣誉感、责任感，从而把连队凝聚成一个讲团结、有干劲的战斗集体。 助力成长的途径是岗位锻炼。工作岗位是人生进取的支点，是实现人生价值的舞台。当前部队官兵的主体是“95后”“00后”，他们普遍学历高、思想活、个性鲜明，但也往往容易理想化、好高骛远。这要求带兵人一方面正确看待他们的个性特点，防止把特点当成缺点，同时也要善于因势利导，立足岗位帮助战士成长。首先是依托岗位制订“成长路线图”。优秀战士的成长不是一蹴而就的，需要基层带兵人用爱心和耐心为他们培土、浇水、施肥，既不能揠苗助长，也不能放任自流，而要紧贴个人实际因材施教，根据锻炼效果及时调整“路线图”。其次是利用岗位搭建“成长舞台”。战士们不怕苦、不怕累，就怕没有施展才华的机会。给任务就是给机会，给平台就是给舞台。这就需要带兵人给战士成长成才多提供平台、多创造条件，使他们锤炼出“练兵所急、胜战所盼、打仗所需”的过硬本领，获得更多的发展机会。最后还要立足岗位“打气撑腰”。建立健全激励和容错机制，在他们遇到困难时加油鼓劲，在他们骄傲自满时提示提醒，在他们迷茫困惑时谈心交心，在充分信任和大胆使用中，鼓励战士们爱岗敬业、磨砺才干、岗位建功、岗位成才。“强军成就人才，人才成就强军”，基层带兵人在带兵一线积极作为，尽好带兵育兵的责任，让更多战士在“人人皆可成才”的氛围中实现“人人尽展其才”，就一定能为强军事业作出贡献，实现自己的人生价值。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124002627/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268732.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231123132438/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268732.html,2023-11-24 0:00:00,The Important Responsibility of Leading Soldiers to Help Soldiers Grow - Helping to Grow Source: china military network - PLA Daily Author: Xu Hongyuan Hu Jing Editor-in-Chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-23 06:44:23 0,"To help growth is an important responsibility of the military man ■ Xu Hongyuan Hu Jing ● to help the growth of the premise is to know the soldiers love soldiers, the key is the same treatment, the way is the post exercise Not long ago, the author's company had a will to leave the army warriors, not only to change their minds, the successful completion of the sergeant selected Jin, but also in the brigade organized by the martial arts competitions to create a record-breaking achievements. This incident triggered the author to think about a realistic topic: as a soldier, in the face of the ""net generation"" warriors, how to live up to the trust of the organization to bring them well, to help them grow? This is the need of the new era of the cause of strengthening the army, but also an important responsibility of each grass-roots troops. The prerequisite for helping to grow is to know and love the soldiers. At present, the relationship between soldiers and officers appear some new situations, for example, some of the soldiers on the warrior ""not far, not close, not pro, not to fight, not scold and not love""; some units ""cadres a circle, a circle of warriors""; some warriors and netizens to communicate with the more, with the comrades to communicate with the less, and the Comrades have become ""familiar strangers""; and so on. These problems affect the relationship between officers and soldiers to varying degrees, restricting the enhancement of combat effectiveness. Due to the existence of these problems, it is impossible to talk about helping officers and soldiers grow. The reason, from the point of view of the soldiers, is to know the soldiers did not know to the root, love soldiers did not love to the heart. Knowing is the foundation of love, love is the foundation of knowledge. Knowing and loving soldiers is the basis for close relations between officers and soldiers, and is a prerequisite for helping soldiers grow. The leader of the soldiers know soldiers love soldiers, soldiers are willing to really regard you as a brother, have words are willing to talk to you, there is a need to be willing to ask you to come up with ideas, in order to help the soldiers to the point. Know the soldiers, not only to clearly grasp the family origin of each soldier, age and education, personality traits, but also on their marriage situation, what they wish and what they want to know; love soldiers, not only to care about the warrior's physical injuries and illnesses, food, clothing, housing, but also pay attention to their state of mind, emotional changes, to the warrior's worry, worry, worry, as their own, like a mentor to care for them as they grow up, like a brother as they care about their lives! The first step is to make sure that you have a good understanding of the situation, so that they can do their jobs without distractions and practice without distractions. The key to help grow is to treat everyone the same. The ability of the warrior is high and low, cognitively different, this is the real problem of the soldiers can not avoid. Some warriors have a better ability to quality, faster adaptation speed, in the company soon came to prominence, for such a warrior, the soldiers tend to take a look at, love a point. On the contrary, the performance of those in the middle of the road or even some backward warriors are often not enough attention, not much care. Some soldiers believe that the front can fight for honor, grasp the back of the head is easy to achieve results, often to grasp the middle of the importance of not enough, not willing to spend effort. I don't know, help this part of the warrior to find a suitable path for their own development, let them grow up quickly, the company construction will have a qualitative leap. Warriors come to the barracks, most of them want to exercise their own, eager to become successful, get the honor. But not the best soldiers because it is easy to be ignored, so the ""fairness"" is often more important, but also more want to be concerned about, be recognized, be needed. Therefore, the grass-roots leaders in helping soldiers grow, we must strive to overcome the utilitarian thinking, do not engage in favoritism, and strive to do ""a bowl of water end of the level"", regardless of the ability to strong or weak, high or low level, how the character of the soldiers are upholding a non-discriminatory attitude, reach out to help, do a good job in the responsibility of educating people. Only in this way can enhance the sense of belonging, honor, sense of responsibility of all soldiers, so that the company cohesion into a unity, motivated fighting collective. The way to help growth is the post exercise. Jobs are the fulcrum of life, is to realize the value of life stage. The main body of the current troops is ""95"" ""00"", they are generally highly educated, living thought, distinctive personality, but also often easy to idealize, over-ambitious. This requires that the military leader, on the one hand, correctly view their personality characteristics, to prevent the characteristics as shortcomings, but also to be good at making the best use of the situation, based on the position to help the soldiers to grow. The first is to rely on the post to develop a ""roadmap for growth"". The growth of outstanding soldiers is not overnight, the need for grass-roots leaders with love and patience for them to cultivate the soil, watering, fertilizer, neither can pull up the seedling, can not be left to their own devices, and should be close to the actual individual tailor-made, according to the effect of the exercise in a timely manner to adjust the ""road map"". Secondly, the use of posts to build a ""growth stage"". Soldiers are not afraid of hard work, not afraid of tiredness, for fear of not having the opportunity to display their talents. To give the task is to give the opportunity to give the platform is to give the stage. This will need to lead the soldiers to the warrior growth and success to provide more platforms, create more conditions, so that they hammered out the ""urgency of the practice, win the war hope, the war needs"" of the strong skills, to get more opportunities for development. Finally, we also need to be based on the post ""pumping support"". Establishment of a sound incentive and fault-tolerance mechanism, in the difficulties they encountered when cheering, in their complacency when prompted to remind them, in their confusion when they are lost and confused to talk about, in full trust and bold use, to encourage warriors to love and dedication to their work, sharpening their talents, job building, job success. ""Strong army achievement talent, talent achievement strong army"", grass-roots military leaders in the front line of the military as a positive, do a good job with the responsibility of training soldiers, so that more soldiers in the ""everyone can be talented"" atmosphere to realize the ""everyone to display their talents! If more soldiers can realize their talents in the atmosphere of ""everyone can be talented"", they will surely be able to contribute to the cause of strengthening the army and realize the value of their lives.","The article discusses the responsibility of leading soldiers to help soldiers grow. It emphasizes the importance of knowing and loving soldiers, treating everyone the same, and utilizing the post exercise to help soldiers develop. The relationship between soldiers and officers has faced some new situations, which has hindered the growth of combat effectiveness. It highlights that knowing the soldiers' background, characteristics, feelings, and needs is crucial in establishing a close connection with them. Additionally, treating everyone the same and using the post exercise as a way to provide opportunities for growth has proven to be an effective way to support soldiers in achieving their potential. Ultimately, helping soldiers grow is essential for the success of the military and the realization of their life's value."

"" This important exposition, captured the key to do people in politics, hit the key points of entrepreneurship, delineated the red line of self-righteousness, for the party cadres to provide a change in the style of the correct atmosphere of the guidelines and mirror. Endeavoring to the new journey, party members and cadres shouldering the mission, only always according to the color of the people, according to the role of the work, loyal and honest, generous and honest, serious and down-to-earth, at any time and in any situation are to oar the first, in order to have a new journey as. According to the color of the person, in order to be calm, handle things will be calm; according to the role of the work, the officer has the direction, the success of the work is guaranteed. President Xi pointed out: ""Being honest is not stupid, doing things pragmatically will not suffer."" For party members and cadres, according to the nature of people and do things according to the role, is a dialectical unity of the whole, the two are conditions for each other, each other as a cause and effect, complement each other, complement each other. Whether it is the revolutionary war era or peace building period, generations of outstanding communists can set up a respectable and learn, can be traced and spiritual monument, is that they can always do according to the nature of the people, according to the role of the work, with practical action to fulfill the external and internal consistency, the integration of virtue and career, cultivation and the unity of the right person. Facts have proved that, do people frankly and honestly, do serious and responsible, steady, can stand firm in front of the big right and wrong, in front of the big wind and big waves calmly, in front of all kinds of temptations to maintain the strength, stand the test. According to the color of the person to show prudent and cautious self-discipline, diligent self-reflection of prudence, reflecting strict discipline, adhere to the party consciousness. President Xi emphasized: ""Party members and cadres should constantly improve the humanistic and spiritual qualities, go vulgar, far from vulgarity, not pandering to vulgarity, so as to cultivate the body and prudent behavior, wai moral self-esteem, clean and self-defense, and always keep the political nature of the Communist Party."" Objectively speaking, a person in the work of the smooth time, adhere to the original heart, abide by the original color is not difficult, difficult is in the face of many challenges and tests, encountered difficulties and setbacks, but also be able to always adhere to, unswerving. On the contrary, those party members and cadres who violated the law to fall, are not from the beginning of forgetting the original heart, lost the original color to start, relaxing on the self-requirements, so that the disciplinary actions from less to more, the disciplinary circumstances from light to heavy, and ultimately subjected to legal and disciplinary sanctions, the lesson is very profound. This color will not be natural quality and freshness, a little inattention may be dusty and discolored. According to the color of the person is not a matter of a while, but a lifetime of things, each party member and cadre should be in the ideological and political constantly review, analysis, reflection, and continue to impurities, in addition to the virus, anti-pollution, really do to the cause of the heart of fervor, loyalty to the heart of the organization, to treat comrades with sincerity, to treat the issue of frankness and honesty, and always keep the state of mind clarity, the heart of the power to thrive. Doing things according to the role is embedded in the attitude of real work, the spirit of down-to-earth, highlighting the pursuit of the courage to work, good at things. President Xi profoundly pointed out that ""according to the law, according to the rules of doing things, is the party cadres must adhere to the principle."" For party members and cadres, the role is both the positioning, position and position, but also carries the mission, responsibility and bearing. In practice, it is staring at the position, chasing fame and fortune, or carry the responsibility to forge ahead, is the actual test of the original heart and color; is to hand over the perfunctory answer sheet to keep the stalls and muddle through, or write an excellent examination paper on the courage to take on the role as the ability to be a practical test of performance; is to engage in privileges capricious and presumptuous, ultra-powerful, overstepping, overstepping the bounds of the work, or loyal and clean rules of the use of power, is the actual test of the character of the official morality. In the discipline is more and more strict, the system cage more and more tight, accountability is more and more big today, each party member and cadres should be correct mindset, posture, the development of the cause of know the trend, know the go, know the guard, the things within the burden of good responsibility, responsible for the responsibility, do the full responsibility, the personal fame and fortune to think through, look at the light, let go of, and effectively first-class standard to do first-class performance, in order to create a new state of development to the state of development, to solid! Style strictly abide by the bottom line red line, so that the use of power is not capricious, the idea is not indulgent, law-abiding not out of line, words and deeds are not out of line. This color needs to be often wiped, the role should always be calibrated. President Xi clearly pointed out that ""we should often compare the Party Constitution, Party rules and discipline, check their ideals and beliefs and thoughts, words and deeds, constantly dust off the dust on the mind, and always keep the political color."" Party members and cadres should pay attention to the combination of internal cultivation and external behavior, study and practice, adhere to the constant learning and new strong party spirit, unremittingly use Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era to gather the soul, focusing on the dynamic follow up learning, profound comprehension on the effort, in the study and practice of understanding in the refining of party spirit, cultivating and shaping the loyalty, so that the scientific theory is internalized into a firm conviction, strong party spirit, and a firm and chaste character, and transformed into the political ability and thinking ability, The Party should take the initiative to find out the requirements of the CPC Constitution. We should take the initiative to find gaps in the requirements of the Party Constitution, check the root causes of the requirements of the Party nature, and make clear initiatives against the requirements of the Party discipline, often undergo a political physical examination, clean up the political dust, correct behavioral deviations, resolutely exercise power in accordance with the rules and regulations, and act according to the requirements of the discipline, and get rid of the dust of thought, the style of work, and the dirt of the behavior in a pragmatic manner; we should consciously strengthen our cultivation in the smallest details, and improve ourselves in every little bit of it, and improve our cultivation from the soul, thought, work, use of power, life, and other aspects of life.  According to the color of the people, according to the role of the work, is both a serious political issue, but also the reality of the practice of the subject. Day by day, I am not afraid of ten million miles, every day I do not begrudge ten million words, and I am not afraid of ten million things when I do them. Strong country building, national rejuvenation of the heavy responsibility on the shoulders of the party cadres in the new era to live up to the heavy responsibility, not to humiliate the mission, it is necessary to do according to the nature of the person, according to the role of the work embodied in the do a good job in every thing, to complete a good job of every task, to fulfill every duty, the set plan to not take refuge in the matter, righteousness does not run away from the responsibility of the deployment of the work to be a good start and finish the work, good good work and good, and strive to the ordinary work to do not unusual, ordinary work to do have a bright spot, in order to make a good job, to make a good job, and to do a good job.

军事论坛丨分散指挥应力求做到“散”而“不乱” 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李玉焱  孙晗  赵艳斌 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-23 06:20:42 0,分散指挥应“散”而“不乱” ■李玉焱  孙晗  赵艳斌 纵观战争历史发展，不确定性是战争的本质属性之一，而战争指挥的关键就是最大限度地减少不确定性。源于此，分散指挥应运而生。分散指挥是相对于集中指挥而言的，是一种将指挥权限逐级下放，赋予下级作战自主权的指挥方式，可以保证下级指挥人员更敏捷高效地应对战争不确定性的发生。随着现代战争作战空间不断拓展，作战力量不断增加，作战节奏不断加快，作战手段不断丰富，分散指挥以其决策周期短、处置战场情况灵活高效的优势，在战场上的地位作用变得越来越重要。 事物是对立统一的矛盾体，分散指挥也不例外。它虽然提高了指挥的灵活性，却破坏了指挥的统一性，容易出现战场上各自为战的混乱局面，不利于形成整体合力。因此，笔者认为，分散指挥应力求做到“散”而“不乱”。“散”指的是战场各分域内作战行动局部混沌的外在表现状态，它是由分散指挥的特点决定的。指挥权限下放，没有上级指挥员及指挥机构的统一计划调控，各分域内部按照各自指挥员及指挥机构的思路想法独立实施各项作战行动，是不可能做到整齐划一的。“不乱”指的是各分域之间能够始终围绕上级指挥员及指挥机构的作战意图，以任务为牵引，实现作战体系的协调有序运行，在战场全局上表现出各分域之间跨域协同、互补增效的整体效果，是可以通过各级指挥员及指挥机构的共同努力达成的。为此，要积极探索分散指挥“散”而“不乱”的方法策略，做到局部混沌、整体有序。 促进军种内聚联合，实现高效指挥。在全域联合的作战背景条件下，战场上各军种之间会因为协同不畅而出现相互掣肘的情况，导致作战体系运行效率降低，整体效能难以有效释放。为此，应建立权威联合的作战指挥机构，促进军种之间实现更加内聚的联合。平时加强军种职能交叉领域的分工协作和军种文化的融合探索，大力开展一体化联合作战训练，战时加强对各军种部队行动的宏观掌控和引导，赋予各军种部队具体任务并明确协同原则、交战规则，使各军种之间能够协调一致地行动、顺畅有序地配合，实现全域多维力量真正的有机融合和一体行动。 聚焦作战任务目的，实现认知统一。在信息技术发达的今天，获取信息已不成问题，问题在于如何共同理解信息，达成认知上的统一。受经验、阅历、知识的影响，每一个个体对同一信息形成不同认知是在所难免的，关键是如何从形形色色的“个识”出发，让大家形成目标一致的“共识”，以确保行为一致。在进行分散指挥时，思想统一是确保整体“不乱”的前提，假如上下级在思维认知上出现信息理解偏差，将导致战场上出现行动偏差。因此，组织作战筹划，首先应聚焦作战任务目的，使大家形成对战场态势的统一认知，以确保后续在全局框架内组织各自的作战行动。 培养主动协同意识，实现分域联动。联合作战是多元作战力量单元在全维作战空间进行的作战，每一个作战分域中都包含有多军兵种一体的联合作战行动，呈现出你中有我、我中有你的“混沌”状态。各作战力量单元在同一域内行动，相互之间如果不互通有无、不协同配合，就可能出现误伤误击、行动冲突、作战效果相互抵消的情况，导致出现既“散”又“乱”的战场态势。因此，作战指挥机构应明确域内主要作战力量和行动，各作战单元要具有主动协同意识，围绕域内主要作战力量和行动规划组织自身在域内的各种行动，并能够在计划协同失效或战局出现重大变化时，主动配合、乐于给其他力量搭台唱戏，实现域内各作战力量单元行动的“形散而神聚”。 瞄准目标靶向定位，实现动态自适。战争唯一的确定性就是它的不确定性，应如何做到清醒地面对战争“迷雾”并理智地展开作战行动？解放战争期间，老一辈革命先辈们已经给出了答案，那就是面对不确定性时，以目标为中心，明确任务，随机应变。济南战役发起前，口号是“打到济南府，活捉王耀武”，目标聚焦而明确。辽沈战役中，锦州攻克后，国民党军“西进兵团”企图凭借战场混乱局面逃窜，我军指挥员下令：“哪里有敌人就往哪里打”，部队目标简洁明确，最终顺利达成战役目的。因此，实施分散指挥，应聚焦作战目标，进行自我动态调整适应，让敌乱我不乱，确保战场局势发展的方向不偏。 借助科技力量手段，实现智能自主。战争是不确定性的王国，战场态势千变万化。要想在拟制作战方案时穷尽所有可能是不现实的，正如陈赓同志所言：“再好的作战方案，战斗一打响，作废一半，另一半随机应变产生。”随着侦察技术手段不断进步，战场上需要处理的情报信息呈指数级增加，留给指挥员决策的时间越来越短。因此，充分发挥机器计算既快又准的优势，谋求人机互补、智能决策的路子势在必行。应借助大数据、云计算、物联网、人工智能等技术手段，快速整合各类数据，深度挖掘情报信息，分析对比敌我优劣，合理调配作战资源，智能规划行动方案，自主调控作战行动，实现以智控局、以智聚优、以智胜愚。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124002627/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268730.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231123110834/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268730.html,2023-11-24 0:00:00,"Military Forum丨Decentralized command should strive to achieve ""scattered"" but ""not chaotic"" Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Li Yuyan Sun Han Zhao Yanbin Editor in Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-23 06:20:42 0","Decentralized command should be ""scattered"" and ""not chaotic"" ■ Li Yuyan Sun Han Zhao Yanbin Throughout the historical development of war, uncertainty is one of the essential attributes of war, and the key to war command is to minimize uncertainty. The key to war command is to minimize the uncertainty. Decentralized command is relative to centralized command, is a kind of command authority level by level decentralization, give the lower level of operational autonomy of the command mode, can ensure that the lower level of commanders more agile and efficient response to the occurrence of war uncertainty. With the modern war combat space continues to expand, combat forces continue to increase, the combat tempo continues to accelerate, the combat means continue to enrich, decentralized command with its decision-making cycle is short, the disposal of the battlefield situation flexible and efficient advantages, the status of the battlefield role has become more and more important. Things are a contradiction of opposites and unity, decentralized command is no exception. Although it improves the flexibility of command, it destroys the unity of command, and is prone to the chaotic situation of fighting separately on the battlefield, which is not conducive to the formation of overall synergy. Therefore, the author believes that decentralized command should strive to achieve ""scattered"" and ""no mess"". ""Scattered"" refers to the battlefield sub-domains of combat operations within the local chaos of the external performance state, it is decentralized command by the characteristics of the decision. Command authority decentralized, no superior commander and the command structure of the unified plan control, the sub-domain in accordance with their respective commanders and the command structure of the idea of independent implementation of the combat action, it is impossible to do a neat and tidy. ""Not chaotic"" refers to the sub-domain can always around the higher commanders and command institutions of the combat intent, to the task as the traction, to achieve the coordination of the combat system in an orderly manner, in the battlefield on the overall performance of the sub-domain between the cross-domain synergies, complementary synergistic effect of the overall effect can be achieved through the concerted efforts of the commanders at all levels and the command institutions. The overall effect can be achieved through the joint efforts of commanders and command organizations at all levels. To this end, we should actively explore the method and strategy of decentralized command ""scattered"" and ""not chaotic"", so as to achieve local chaos and overall order. Promote the cohesive union of military branches to realize efficient command. In the overall joint combat background conditions, the battlefield between the various branches of the military will be due to poor synergy and the emergence of mutual constraints, resulting in a reduction in the operational efficiency of the combat system, the overall effectiveness is difficult to effectively release. For this reason, an authoritative joint operational command structure should be established to promote the realization of a more cohesive union between the military branches. In peacetime, strengthen the division of labor in the cross-functional areas of the military branches and explore the integration of military culture, vigorously carry out integrated joint combat training, and in wartime, strengthen the macro-control and guidance of the actions of the military branches, give specific tasks to the military branches, and clarify the principles of synergy and rules of engagement, so that the various branches of the military branches can act in a coordinated manner and work together in a smooth and orderly manner to achieve the real organic fusion of multidimensional forces across the entire region and the integration of the whole. Action. Focus on the purpose of the combat mission to achieve cognitive unity. In today's advanced information technology, access to information is no longer a problem, the problem lies in how to jointly understand the information and achieve cognitive unity. Subject to experience, experience, knowledge, each individual to the same information to form a different cognition is inevitable, the key is how to start from all kinds of ""personal knowledge"", so that we can form a ""consensus"" of the same goal to ensure that the same behavior. In the decentralized command, the unity of thought is to ensure that the whole ""no chaos"" prerequisite, if the upper and lower levels in the thinking cognitive information understanding bias, will lead to action bias on the battlefield. Therefore, the organization of combat planning, the first should focus on the purpose of the combat mission, so that we form a unified cognition of the battlefield situation to ensure the subsequent organization of their respective combat operations within the framework of the overall situation. Cultivate the sense of active coordination and realize sub-domain linkage. Joint operation is a multi-dimensional combat force unit in the full-dimensional combat space for combat, each combat sub-domain contains a multi-military and military services as a joint operation, showing you have me, I have you in the ""chaos"" state. Each combat unit in the same domain action, each other, if not interoperability, not synergistic cooperation, there may be accidental injuries and misfires, action conflicts, combat effects offset each other, resulting in the emergence of both ""scattered"" and ""chaotic"" battlefield situation. Therefore, the combat command structure should be clear that the main combat forces and actions within the domain, the combat unit to have a sense of initiative and coordination, around the main combat forces and actions within the domain of planning and organizing their own actions within the domain, and in the failure of the plan to coordinate or major changes in the battlefield, take the initiative to cooperate with, and happy to give other forces to set up a stage to sing, to achieve a unit of combat forces within the domain of action of the ""Form scattering but God gathering"". Aim at the target targeting, realize dynamic self-adaptation. The only certainty of war is its uncertainty, how to do soberly face the war ""fog"" and rationally launch combat operations? During the liberation war, the old generation of revolutionary forefathers have given the answer, that is, in the face of uncertainty, the target as the center, clear tasks, improvisation. Before the Battle of Jinan was launched, the slogan was ""Fight to Jinan Province and capture Wang Yaowu alive"", the goal was focused and clear. In the Liao-Shen Battle, after the capture of Jinzhou, the Kuomintang Army ""Westward Corps"" attempted to escape by virtue of the chaos of the battlefield, and our commanders ordered: ""Where there is an enemy, where to fight"", the troops' goal is concise and clear, and eventually successfully achieved the purpose of the battle. Therefore, the implementation of decentralized command, should focus on the combat objectives, self dynamic adjustment to adapt to the enemy chaos I do not mess, to ensure that the direction of the development of the battlefield situation is not biased. With the help of scientific and technological power means to realize intelligent autonomy. War is the kingdom of uncertainty, and the battlefield situation is ever-changing. To exhaust all possibilities in the preparation of combat programs is unrealistic, as Comrade Chen Geng said: ""and then a good combat program, the battle a fight, scrapped half, the other half of the random response."" With the continuous progress of reconnaissance technology means, the battlefield needs to deal with the exponential increase in intelligence information, leaving the commanders to make decisions for a shorter and shorter period of time. Therefore, give full play to the advantages of machine computing both fast and accurate, seeking complementary human-machine, intelligent decision-making path is imperative. With the help of big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and other technical means, rapid integration of various types of data, in-depth mining of intelligence information, analysis and comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy, the rational deployment of combat resources, intelligent planning of action programs, autonomous control of combat operations, to achieve the wisdom of the control situation, to the wisdom of the gathering of excellence, wisdom to win the fool.","The article discusses the concept of decentralized command in military operations, emphasizing the need to achieve a balance between flexibility and maintaining unity in the face of uncertainty. The idea is that while decentralized command can allow for quicker decision-making and more agile responses to changing situations, it can also lead to isolated actions and confusion on the battlefield, which is counterproductive to achieving overall synergy and effectiveness.

To address this, the author suggests exploring methods and strategies to achieve a balance between ""scattered"" and ""not chaotic"" in decentralized command. This means allowing sub-domains to have some autonomy in their combat actions while still aligning around the overall intent of the higher commanders and maintaining a coordinated approach.

The article also emphasizes the importance of establishing an authoritative joint operational command structure to promote a more cohesive union between different military branches, strengthening their division of labor and integration in peacetime, and guiding their actions together in wartime to maximize overall effectiveness.

Furthermore, the article highlights the need to focus on the purpose of the combat mission to achieve cognitive unity, which means ensuring that all levels of command share a common understanding of the situation and goals. It also emphasizes the importance of developing a sense of active coordination among different combat units, linking their actions together to achieve a more integrated and effective response.

Lastly, the article highlights the importance of targeting and dynamic self-adaptation, suggesting that commanders should keep their focus on the objectives and adapt to changing situations while also taking advantage of the technological advancements available, like machine computing and big data analysis, to improve decision-making and enhance the intelligence of autonomous command and operations."
“土”“低”“易”作战方法和手段并非无用武之地 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：胡建新 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-23 06:18:46 0,战场妙用“土办法” ■胡建新 ●在“高”“新”“奇”武器及手段占据战场主导地位的情况下，简单而随机的“土”“低”“易”作战方法和手段并非无用武之地 最近在媒体上看到一个故事：有家企业引进了一条香皂生产线，没想到这条生产线存在缺陷，常有盒子漏装香皂。为此，企业请来一位自动化专家寻找解决方案。专家召集十几人、花费数十万元，研制出一台自动检测设备，凡有空盒通过，该设备就会自动报警并捡走空盒。巧的是，另一家企业同样引进了这条生产线并遇到了同样问题，车间工人将一台电风扇放置在生产线旁边吹风，未装肥皂的空盒统统被吹走。 两家企业，一家采取耗资巨大的“高科技”，一家采用成本低廉的“土办法”，最终殊途同归，都解决了问题。就其效果而言，二者完全一样；就其成本而言，二者却有天壤之别。倘若在战场上遇到类似问题，后者效益效率更加明显，因为它不但运作简便，而且成本低廉。更重要的是，它又“土”又“简单”，能收到出敌不意、以奇取胜的效果。 与上述事例恰好相反，有时高端的“新奇特”反倒解决不了普通的“土问题”，甚至还会发生严重错误。前不久，网上流传一个视频：在一台人工智能仪器面前，身着普通服装的行人都被轻而易举地识别出身份，可一位身穿奇装异服、头发染成彩色的男子经过时，竟被其标注为“长颈鹿”。这样的结果让人啼笑皆非。 先进的高科技设备及手段在处理普通事务和简单问题时，常常存在因避简就繁而发生误识和错判。这就告诉人们：世界上一切事物都是相生相克、相辅相成的，在一定条件下，先进的东西可以用“原始”的手段去征服，复杂的问题也可以用简单的办法去解决。“土办法”可以应对高科技，低成本也能够实现高效益，“玄机”尽在因地制宜、灵活机变之中。1940年百团大战期间，八路军一部包围了日军的一个重要据点，但无论我军怎样猛烈攻击，坚固工事内的日军就是龟缩不出、负隅顽守。我方指挥员忽生一计，将炮弹内一部分火药倒出，装入辣椒粉，做成几十发“辣椒炮弹”，然后一顿猛轰，日军闻到刺眼又刺鼻的辣味后不得不跑出工事，结果被我军全歼，“土办法”发挥了大作用。 现代战争因使用大量先进武器，其形态、样式和战法等发生了巨大变化。但万变不离其宗，战争的一些常规手段和普通方法或许永远不会过时。科索沃战争中，面对美军F-117A隐身飞机有恃无恐地出动与空袭，南联盟军通过普通的通信窃听法获取了该飞机的飞行航线与出动规律，进而将其捕捉并击落。击落此飞机的萨姆-3导弹，尽管北约事先掌握了它的阵地位置，南联盟军却采用“打一枪换一个地方”的“原始”办法，成功避开了对手高技术兵器的空中打击。 未来战争是信息化智能化战争，各类新型武器装备大量投入战场，作战手段更加先进，攻击行动更加多变，战争的盖然性和不确定性更加突出。在“高”“新”“奇”武器及手段占据战场主导地位的情况下，简单而随机的“土”“低”“易”作战方法和手段并非无用武之地。尤其是信息化智能化武器的预设程序和自主运行，在不少情况下使其显得有些过于“死板”，有针对地使用非对称的“土办法”反而能收得奇效。因此，在努力推进新军事革命、大力研发运用高新技术武器的同时，还要尽力挖掘传统武器及其战术战法的可利用价值，勇于并善于用诸如“电扇吹空盒”之类的“土办法”、简易方法和普通手段，去解决作战过程中遇到的一些“伤脑筋”问题，使用战争史上或无先例、对手全然意想不到的战术战法，去收获出人意料的效果。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124002627/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268729.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231123110039/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268729.html,2023-11-24 0:00:00,"""Earth"", ""low"" and ""easy"" combat methods and means are not useless Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Hu Jianxin Editor in Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11- 23 06:18:46 0","The battlefield wonderful use of ""dirt"" ■ Hu Jianxin ● in the ""high"", ""new"", ""strange"" weapons and means to occupy the battlefield In the case of ""high"", ""new"", ""strange"" weapons and means to dominate the battlefield, simple and random ""soil"", ""low"", ""easy"" combat methods and means is not useless Recently, I saw a story in the media: a company introduced a soap production line. A soap production line, did not realize that this production line has defects, often have a box missing soap. To this end, the enterprise invited an automation expert to find a solution. Experts convened a dozen people, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, developed an automatic detection equipment, where there is an empty box through the device will automatically alarm and pick up the empty box. Coincidentally, another enterprise also introduced this production line and encountered the same problem, workshop workers will be placed in an electric fan next to the production line to blow the wind, not loaded with soap empty boxes are blown away. Two enterprises, one to take a costly ""high-tech"", a low-cost ""local methods"", and ultimately the same way, both solved the problem. In terms of their effects, they are exactly the same; in terms of their costs, they are worlds apart. If similar problems are encountered on the battlefield, the latter's effectiveness and efficiency is more obvious, because it is not only easy to operate, but also low-cost. More importantly, it is ""earthy"" and ""simple"", and can receive the effect of surprise and win by surprise. Contrary to the above examples, sometimes high-end ""novelty"" can't solve the common ""soil problem"", and even serious mistakes will happen. Not long ago, a video circulated on the Internet: in front of an artificial intelligence instrument, dressed in ordinary clothing pedestrians are easily identified, but a man wearing strange clothes, hair dyed in color when passing by, it was marked as ""giraffe"". The result was laughable. Advanced high-tech equipment and means in dealing with ordinary affairs and simple issues, there are often due to the avoidance of simplicity and complexity and misrecognition and misjudgment. This tells people: all things in the world are mutually reinforcing, complementary, under certain conditions, advanced things can be used ""primitive"" means to conquer, complex problems can be solved in a simple way. The ""dirt"" can cope with high-tech, low-cost can also realize high efficiency, ""mystery"" in the local conditions, flexibility and change. 1940 during the Hundred Regiments War, the Eighth Route Army surrounded an important Japanese stronghold, but no matter how fierce our troops Attack, solid fortifications within the Japanese army is hunkered down, stubbornly defending. Our commanders suddenly came up with a plan, part of the gunpowder inside the shells poured out, loaded with chili powder, made dozens of rounds of ""chili shells"", and then a fierce bombardment, the Japanese army smelled the eye-piercing and pungent smell of spicy and had to run out of the fortifications, and the result was completely destroyed by our troops, ""earth methods"" Played a big role. Modern warfare due to the use of a large number of advanced weapons, its form, style and method of warfare has changed dramatically. But all changes remain the same, some conventional means and ordinary methods of war may never be out of date. In the Kosovo War, in the face of the U.S. Army F-117A stealth aircraft emboldened to move out and air strikes, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Army through the ordinary communications eavesdropping method to obtain the flight path of the aircraft and the pattern of movement, and then captured and shot down the aircraft. The SAM-3 missile that shot down this airplane, despite the fact that NATO had mastered its position in advance, the FRY adopted the ""primitive"" method of ""shooting at a different place"" and successfully avoided the aerial strikes of the opponent's high-tech weaponry.

深化军事政策制度评估机制研究 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：田甜 张宪 王亚红 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-23 06:15:09 0,深化军事政策制度评估机制研究 ■田甜　张宪　王亚红 引言 军事政策制度调整军事关系、规范军事实践、保障军事发展，对国防和军队建设具有重要意义。对军事政策制度进行评估，有助于全面掌握政策制度质量水平，优化政策制度体系，减少或避免一些风险隐患，是确保政策制度切合实际、行之有效的必要举措。对军事政策制度评估基本问题进行研究，明晰其基本概念，认清其功能作用，掌握其评估方法，对于有效开展军事政策评估、提高评估质量效益具有十分重要的作用。 明晰军事政策制度评估基本概念 军事政策制度评估是指特定评估主体根据特定评估目的，按照一定的标准、程序和方法，对军事政策制度政策制定、政策效果等环节和内容进行评估或判断的一系列活动。目的是通过综合分析存在的问题，研究提出改进建议，改进完善法规质量水平，为提高政策制度质量和实施效果提供重要支撑。 根据评估时段来区分，军事政策制度评估可分为政策执行前的预评估、政策执行中的执行评估和政策执行后的后评估。军事政策制度预评估主要对政策制度方案（草案）以及其可能产生的效果进行评估或判断，军事政策制度执行评估是对政策制定以及实施过程进行评估，军事政策制度后评估则重在对政策制度实施效果和影响进行评估。军事政策制度预评估、执行评估和后评估，对应政策制度全寿命周期执行前、执行中和执行后三个不同阶段，三种评估模式互为依托、相互补充。预评估为执行评估奠定良好政策基础，预评估的结果是判断当前政策方案科学性、合理性的标准；执行评估是考察政策执行效率水平的基本依据，目的是提高政策运行绩效，为后评估做好准备；后评估是确定政策调整或终结的前提和条件，为后续政策制度出台或政策制度体系优化提供分析预判，为下一轮政策制度预评估奠定基础。 预评估的评估对象是政策制度文本、草案或者工作计划、工作方案，评估时机通常是在政策制度正式出台前，在编制立法规划和年度立法计划、政策制度提请审议两个关键环节，目的是通过对各种可能存在的潜在风险进行预判和分析，以优化政策制度顶层设计、提高法规拟制质量水平。执行评估的评估对象是政策制定与执行过程，评估时机是在政策执行一段时间后，目的是通过对政策制度实施进行阶段性总结和回顾性分析，检验军事政策制度实施是否达到预期效果，评判政策制度实施的短板弱项和经验教训，为调整优化具体政策制度提供决策支持。后评估的评估对象是政策制度的实施效果和影响，评估时机是政策实施较长时间且政策制度立改废释等工作完成前，目的是对政策制度的合法性、可行性进行综合评估，为具体政策制度修改完善和后续政策制度体系优化提供决策支撑。 认清军事政策制度评估功能作用 政策评估是政策运行过程链条上的重要一环，是检验政策实施效果、效益和效率的基本途径，是决定政策走向的重要依据，是合理配置资源的有效手段，是提高政策运行科学性和准确性的必要手段。军事政策制度评估为考察军事政策制度提供了不同视角、不同方法，准确把握预评估、执行评估和后评估的功能作用，有助于有效开展军事政策制度评估。 军事政策制度预评估是预判避免风险隐患、提升政策制度质量水平的重要手段。军事政策制度预评估具有判断、预测、选择与导向等功能，合理评估有助于增强立法的及时性、针对性、实效性、系统性。新的军事政策制度出台是有效应对新形势新任务、合理配置资源、提高政策制度有效性的必要举措。各项具体政策执行出台前，需要考虑有效应对各种复杂情况，需要考虑各项法规制度之间的关联耦合，需要考虑法规制度的潜在风险和预期后果，在其出台前进行预评估有助于减少或避免不良效果，优化政策制度体系设计，填补政策制度体系空白，减少相关法规制度交叉，提升政策制度质量水平。 军事政策制度执行评估是监测政策制度过程执行、纠正调整政策制度偏差的重要手段。军事政策制度执行评估具有监测、诊断、调整、修正的功能。对军事政策制度执行情况进行评估是检验监测政策制度执行过程和阶段实施效果的重要指标。各项具体政策制度执行过程中，可能由于政策制度本身规范性不完备、可操作性不强、对各种新情况考虑不周或者信息不充分等因素，使得政策方案被误解、曲解，滥用政策或政策不力，导致政策执行效果不佳。对军事政策制度过程和执行效果进行评估，有助于全面把握政策制度执行情况，着眼各项具体政策制度执行过程中的短板弱项，为高层决策机关提供及时的信息反馈，为提高政策制度可执行性和政策制度立改废等工作提供决策优化，有助于立法机关总结立法工作正反两方面的经验并不断改进军事立法工作。 军事政策制度后评估是检验政策制度运行效果、调整优化完善政策体系的重要手段。军事政策制度后评估具有检验、总结、反馈、完善的功能，是对军事政策制度执行效果影响进行的综合评估。军事政策制度都是针对特定情况、解决特定问题而出台的，在一定时期内具有存在的合理性；但是各项具体政策制度条款相对固化，对新情况的处置相对比较保守，在长时间执行后会逐渐暴露出与实践不相符合的情况，要么不能有效应对和处理新情况，要么本身的规范不够科学合理，相关的配套措施不够具体有效。对军事政策制度进行后评估，有助于全面把握各项具体政策制度长期的累积效应以及政策制度的执行情况，为后续政策制度的出台提供决策支持。 掌握军事政策制度评估一般方法 军事政策制度评估方法是实现评估目的的重要手段。按照原理可分为经验分析与演绎分析，按照老旧可分为常规方法和现代方法，按照性质可分为定性分析与定量分析方法。当前，常用的方法有过程对比法、指标体系法、调查研究法和跨学科分析法。 过程对比法。过程对比法是通过对比不同阶段政策结果来确定政策实施效果，分析存在问题的方法。可将政策执行前和执行后的各种情况作对比，将政策实施前的有关指标与实施后的有关指标进行对比，可以分组实验借以确定政策实施效果；可在政策执行前和执行后两个时间点上，分别就采取某一政策和无此政策两种情况进行前后对比，比较两次结果以确定被分析政策的效果。过程对比法可以采用简单的定性对比，也可通过复杂的数据分析来得出评估结论。 指标体系法。指标体系法是评估军事政策制度的基本方法，是在全面考察评估对象特性的基础上，按照特征提取、量化分析的思路，形成由表征评估对象各方面特性及其相互联系的多个指标所构成的有机整体。指标体系具有层级结构特性，指标体系各指标相互独立、互为补充，能够全面度量评估对象特性。基于评估指标体系，采集评估过程数据，综合运用统计分析、决策分析等工具方法，可以得到较为精准的评估结论。 调查研究法。调查研究法是借助于一定的调查手段，通过听取被调查者的感受，获得对公共政策必要性或政策结果的认识，从而评估公共政策的方法。包括直接调查法、问卷调查法和访谈法等。直接调查需要专家按照事先拟定提纲就特定问题发表意见。直接调查法是发现问题、认识问题的重要方法，通常用于政策实施前。问卷调查法是通过向特定人群下发问卷和回收问卷，进而了解政策感受、评估政策效果。访谈法是按调查提纲，对被调查人进行面对面的调查，其针对性更强，评估价值更高。调查研究法的科学准确性主要受调查专家能力水平和专家数量影响。 跨学科分析法。跨学科分析法是指充分利用管理学、运筹学、决策学、统计学、经济学、计算机科学等方法，对军事政策制度进行评估的方法。其兼具定性分析和定量分析的优势，是政策制度评估的发展方向。其中，多属性决策分析、回归分析、费效比分析、逻辑分析、价值分析、成本效益分析以及专家系统、数据挖掘、计算机仿真等都是常用的分析方法。大数据、人工智能、机器学习等方法，是政策制度评估的前沿方法。跨学科分析法具有广泛的普适性，其实施操作难度也最大。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124002627/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268728.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124052614/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268728.html,2023-11-24 0:00:00,"Deepening Research on Assessment Mechanisms of Military Policies and Systems Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Tian Tian, Zhang Xian, Wang Yahong Responsibility: Yixi Ram 2023-11-23 06:15:09 0","Deepening the Research on the Assessment Mechanism of Military Policies and Systems ■ Tian Tian, Zhang Xian, and Wang Yahong Introduction Military policies and systems adjust military relations, regulate military practices, and safeguard military development, and are of great significance to national defense and military construction. Evaluation of military policies and systems helps to fully grasp the quality level of policies and systems, optimize the system of policies and systems, reduce or avoid some risks and hidden dangers, and is a necessary measure to ensure that policies and systems are practical and effective. It is a necessary step to ensure that the policy system is practical and effective. It is very important to study the basic issues of military policy system assessment, clarify its basic concepts, recognize its functions, and master its assessment methods, so as to effectively carry out the assessment of military policies and improve the quality and effectiveness of the assessment. Clarifying the basic concept of military policy system assessment Military policy system assessment refers to a series of activities in which a specific assessment subject assesses or judges the policy formulation, policy effect and other aspects and contents of the military policy system according to a specific assessment purpose and in accordance with certain standards, procedures and methods. The purpose is to comprehensively analyze existing problems, make recommendations for improvement, and improve the quality of regulations, so as to provide important support for improving the quality of the policy system and the effectiveness of its implementation. According to the evaluation period, the evaluation of military policies and systems can be divided into the pre-assessment before policy implementation, the evaluation of policy implementation and the post-assessment after policy implementation. Pre-assessment of the military policy system mainly assesses or judges the program (draft) of the policy system and its possible effects, while the assessment of the implementation of the military policy system assesses the process of policy formulation and implementation, and the post-assessment of the military policy system focuses on the assessment of the effects and impacts of the implementation of the policy system. The pre-assessment, implementation assessment and post-assessment of the military policy system correspond to the three different phases of the whole life cycle of the policy system, namely, before, during and after the implementation, and the three assessment modes are mutually dependent and complementary. Pre-assessment lays a good policy foundation for implementation assessment, and the results of pre-assessment are the criteria for judging the scientificity and reasonableness of the current policy program; implementation assessment is the basic basis for examining the level of efficiency of policy implementation, with the aim of improving the performance of policy operation and preparing for post-assessment; post-assessment is the prerequisite for determining the premise and conditions of policy adjustment or termination, and it provides analytical prediction for the introduction of the subsequent policy system or the optimization of the policy system system. It lays the foundation for the next round of policy system pre-assessment. The targets of pre-assessment are the texts, drafts, work plans and work programs of the policy system, and the timing of the assessment is usually before the formal introduction of the policy system, in the two key stages of preparing legislative planning and annual legislative plans, and submitting the policy system for deliberation. The purpose is to optimize the top-level design of the policy system and improve the quality of the regulations proposed by pre-assessment and analysis of the various potential risks that may exist. Implementation assessment targets the process of policy formulation and implementation, and the timing of the assessment is after the policy has been implemented for a certain period of time. The purpose of the assessment is to carry out a stage-by-stage summary and retrospective analysis of the implementation of the policy system, to test whether the implementation of the military policy system has achieved the expected results, to judge the shortcomings and weaknesses of the implementation of the policy system as well as lessons learned, and to provide decision-making support for the adjustment and optimization of specific policies and systems. The object of post-assessment is to assess the effect and impact of the implementation of the policy system, and the timing of the assessment is to assess the implementation of the policy for a longer period of time and before the completion of the work of establishing, changing, abolishing and interpreting the policy system, with the aim of comprehensively evaluating the legitimacy and feasibility of the policy system, and providing decision-making support for the modification and improvement of the specific policy system and for the optimization of the subsequent policy system system. Recognizing the functional role of military policy system assessment Policy assessment is an important link in the chain of the policy operation process, a basic way to test the effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of policy implementation, an important basis for deciding the direction of the policy, an effective means of rationally allocating resources, and a necessary means to improve the scientific and accurate operation of the policy. Military policy system assessment provides different perspectives and methods for examining the military policy system, and accurately grasping the functional roles of pre-assessment, implementation assessment and post-assessment helps to effectively carry out the assessment of the military policy system. Pre-assessment of the military policy system is an important means of pre-judging and avoiding risks and hidden dangers, and improving the quality of the policy system. The pre-assessment of military policies and systems has the functions of judgment, prediction, selection and orientation, and reasonable assessment helps to enhance the timeliness, relevance, effectiveness and systematization of legislation. The introduction of new military policies and systems is a necessary step to effectively respond to new situations and tasks, rationalize the allocation of resources, and improve the effectiveness of the policy system. Before the introduction of specific policies, we need to consider effective response to a variety of complex situations, we need to consider the linkage and coupling between the various regulations and systems, we need to consider the potential risks and expected consequences of the regulations and systems, pre-assessment before its introduction will help reduce or avoid adverse effects, optimize the design of the policy system, fill the gaps in the policy system, reduce the intersection of the relevant laws and regulations, and enhance the quality of the policy system. The assessment of the implementation of the military policy system is the first step in monitoring the implementation of the policy system. The assessment of the implementation of the military policy system is an important means of monitoring the implementation of the policy system and correcting and adjusting the deviation of the policy system. The assessment of the implementation of the military policy system has the functions of monitoring, diagnosis, adjustment and correction. The assessment of the implementation of the military policy system is an important indicator for testing and monitoring the effectiveness of the process and stage of implementation of the policy system. In the implementation process of each specific policy system, it may be due to factors such as incomplete normativity of the policy system itself, poor operability, poor consideration of various new situations or insufficient information, which makes the policy program misunderstood, misinterpreted, abusive of the policy or ineffective of the policy, and leads to ineffective implementation of the policy. Evaluating the process and implementation effects of military policies and systems can help to comprehensively grasp the implementation of policies and systems, focus on the shortcomings and weaknesses in the implementation of specific policies and systems, provide high-level decision-making organs with timely information feedback, optimize decision-making for the improvement of the enforceability of policies and systems and for the establishment, reform and abolition of policies and systems, and help the legislative organs to summarize the positive and negative experiences of the legislative work and to continuously improve the work of military legislation. Post-assessment of military policies and systems Post-assessment of military policies and systems is an important means of testing the effectiveness of the operation of policies and systems, and of adjusting, optimizing and perfecting the policy system. Post-assessment of the military policy system has the functions of testing, summarizing, giving feedback and improving, and is a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the implementation of the military policy system. Military policies and systems are introduced for specific situations and to solve specific problems, and have the rationality of existence within a certain period of time; however, the provisions of specific policies and systems are relatively solidified, and the disposition of new situations is relatively conservative, and will gradually be exposed after a long period of time after the implementation of the situation is not in line with the practice, either it can't effectively cope with and deal with the new situation, or its own norms are not scientific and reasonable enough, and the relevant supporting measures are not specific enough and effective enough. or the norms themselves are not scientific and reasonable enough, and the relevant supporting measures are not specific and effective enough. Post-assessment of military policies and systems can help to fully grasp the cumulative effects of specific policies and systems over time and their implementation, and provide decision-making support for the introduction of subsequent policies and systems. Mastering the general methodology of military policy system assessment The methodology of military policy system assessment is an important means of realizing the purpose of assessment. According to the principle can be divided into empirical analysis and deductive analysis, according to the old can be divided into conventional and modern methods, according to the nature can be divided into qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis methods. Currently, the commonly used methods are process comparison method, indicator system method, survey research method and interdisciplinary analysis method. Process comparison method. Process comparison method is a method to determine the effect of policy implementation and analyze the problems by comparing the results of policies at different stages. Can be the policy implementation before and after the implementation of a variety of situations for comparison, the policy implementation before the implementation of the relevant indicators and the implementation of the relevant indicators for comparison, can be grouped experiments to determine the effect of policy implementation; can be in the policy implementation before and after the implementation of the two points in time, respectively, on the adoption of a certain policy and the absence of this policy before and after the comparison of the two situations, compare the two results in order to determine the effect of the policy being analyzed. The process comparison method can use simple qualitative comparisons or complex data analysis to draw assessment conclusions. Indicator System Approach. The indicator system method is the basic method for assessing the military policy system, which is based on a comprehensive examination of the characteristics of the assessment object, and in accordance with the idea of feature extraction and quantitative analysis, forms an organic whole consisting of multiple indicators that characterize the characteristics of the assessment object in various aspects and their interconnections. The indicator system has a hierarchical structure, and the indicators of the indicator system are independent of each other, complement each other, and can comprehensively measure the characteristics of the assessment object. Based on the evaluation index system, collecting data from the evaluation process and comprehensively applying statistical analysis, decision analysis and other tools and methods, a more accurate evaluation conclusion can be obtained. Survey and research method. The survey research method is a method of assessing public policies with the help of certain investigation means, by listening to the feelings of the respondents and obtaining the understanding of the necessity of public policies or policy results. Including direct survey method, questionnaire survey method and interview method. Direct investigation requires experts to express their opinions on specific issues in accordance with a pre-drafted outline. The direct survey method is an important method for identifying and recognizing problems, and is usually used before policy implementation. Questionnaire survey method is through the distribution of questionnaires to a specific group of people and the recovery of questionnaires, in order to understand the feelings of the policy, to assess the effectiveness of the policy. The interview method is a face-to-face survey of the respondents according to the outline of the survey, which is more targeted and has a higher assessment value. The scientific accuracy of the survey research method is mainly affected by the level of ability of the survey experts and the number of experts. Interdisciplinary analysis method. The interdisciplinary analysis method refers to the method of assessing the military policy system by making full use of the methods of management, operations research, decision-making, statistics, economics and computer science. It combines the advantages of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis, and is the development direction of policy system assessment. Among them, multi-attribute decision analysis, regression analysis, cost-effectiveness ratio analysis, logical analysis, value analysis, cost-benefit analysis, as well as expert systems, data mining, computer simulation, etc., are commonly used analysis methods. Methods such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are cutting-edge methods for policy system evaluation. Interdisciplinary analysis methods are widely universal and their implementation and operation are the most difficult.","The article discusses the importance of evaluating military policies and systems in order to fully grasp their quality level, optimize the system, and ensure the effectiveness of policy implementation.

【理响中国】习近平文化思想的哲学意蕴 来源：中国社会科学网-中国社会科学报 作者：骞真 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-24 21:00:28 0,习近平文化思想是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的重要组成部分，是新时代党领导文化建设实践经验的理论概括和科学总结，在党的宣传思想文化事业发展史上具有里程碑意义。作为习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的文化篇，习近平文化思想立意高远、思想深邃、内涵丰富，既有认识论又有方法论，既有顶层设计又有具体实践，实现了新时代马克思主义中国化时代化新的飞跃。其中，“魂脉”与“根脉”、“政党”与“群众”、“民族”与“世界”、“明体”与“达用”交相辉映、相互联结的辩证特征，深刻体现了习近平文化思想深厚的哲学意蕴，为我们在新时代继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明提供了强大的思想引领和行动指南。 “魂脉”与“根脉”的辩证统一 不断谱写马克思主义中国化时代化新篇章，是中国共产党人的庄严使命。习近平总书记强调：“马克思主义中国化时代化这个重大命题本身就决定，我们决不能抛弃马克思主义这个魂脉，决不能抛弃中华优秀传统文化这个根脉。坚守好这个魂和根，是理论创新的基础和前提。”一方面，坚持马克思主义之“魂”是推动理论创新的基础。魂者，器物之统摄也，无魂则难以聚气。理论创新不仅要遵循一定的科学规律，更要具备先进的价值引领。对中国共产党人而言，马克思主义既是科学规律，又是价值引领。在科学规律中，马克思主义是对自然、社会和人类思维发展本质和规律的正确反映，由马克思创立的唯物史观和剩余价值论为我们指明了人类社会发展的一般性规律；在价值引领上，马克思主义是关于无产阶级解放的学说，带领全人类实现自身解放是马克思主义的最终目标。拥有马克思主义，就等于拥有了真理和价值，也正是在马克思主义真理与价值的指导下，我们才创造了丰富多彩的中国特色社会主义先进文化。另一方面，坚持中华优秀传统文化之“根”是理论创新的前提。根者，事物之本源也，无根则难以立身。文化是一个国家最深沉、最持久的力量。中华民族之所以能够延绵不绝、历久弥新，一个最重要的前提就是有中华优秀传统文化的历史传承。中华优秀传统文化中的价值观念、道德信仰、家国情怀等文化因素构成了全体中华儿女共同的思想体系和精神内核，这也是中华民族能够团结一致、砥砺前行的重要原因。习近平文化思想中“魂脉”与“根脉”的辩证统一，就是要坚持守正与创新，推动马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合。“第二个结合”不是一个“消灭”一个，也不是二者合二为一，而是相互成就、相互激活，在对方的影响下各自朝着融合的方向共同发展，用马克思主义先进的、科学的立场守理论之正，用中华优秀传统文化的力量创文化之新，二者共同在中国特色社会主义的伟大实践中凝心聚魂、固本培元，朝着中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦阔步前行。 “政党”与“群众”的辩证统一 习近平文化思想是党群融合的光辉典范，为当前我国文化建设指明了科学方向。习近平总书记强调：“宣传思想文化工作事关党的前途命运，事关国家长治久安，事关民族凝聚力和向心力，是一项极端重要的工作。”一方面，党的领导是社会主义文化繁荣的根本保证。中国共产党是一个具有高度自觉的文化型政党。自成立之日起，我们党就把建设中华民族文化事业作为自己的历史使命，团结带领全国人民发展社会主义先进文化，推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展，全方位培育社会主义核心价值观，大力弘扬以伟大建党精神为源头的中国共产党人精神谱系，在实践中建设中华民族现代文明，创造了人类文明新形态。坚持党对宣传思想文化工作的领导，就是要旗帜鲜明地坚持党管媒体、党管宣传、党管意识形态，党媒党报党刊更要无条件地宣传党的主张，在政治上、思想上、价值上牢牢掌握宣传思想文化工作的领导权，建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态。另一方面，群众路线是我们党推动文化建设的根本工作路线。习近平总书记强调：“要把满足人民精神文化需求作为文艺和文艺工作的出发点和落脚点，把人民作为文艺表现的主体，把人民作为文艺审美的鉴赏家和评判者，把为人民服务作为文艺工作者的天职。”人民是文艺作品的创造者和参与者，理应成为文艺作品的享受者。坚持群众路线，就是要牢固树立群众观点，让人民群众自由自觉地参与到文化创造的活动中来，感受文化更深沉、更持久的力量，不断满足人民群众对精神文化的需要。习近平文化思想充分彰显了中国共产党以人民为中心的价值立场，深刻回答了文化建设的核心问题，全面反映了习近平总书记深厚的人民情怀。“政党”与“群众”的辩证统一就是要坚持党的领导与群众路线相统一，处理好“根本领导”与“根本立场”的关系，深刻回答文化思想“由谁领导”和“为谁领导”的原则性、根本性问题，在实践中赋予马克思主义唯物史观以新的哲学内涵。 “民族”与“世界”的辩证统一 文化是民族的，也是世界的。习近平总书记指出，一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。如果世界上只有一种花朵，就算这种花朵再美，那也是单调的。无论中华文明，还是世界上存在的其他文明，都是人类文明创造的成果。一方面，要大力建设中华民族现代文明，这是当前我国文化建设的使命和任务。中华民族现代文明是中国共产党领导全国人民在实现中国式现代化过程中创造的人类文明新形态，它是“两个结合”的创新性产物。当前，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，中华民族伟大复兴进入关键时期，数字化时代信息化浪潮迅猛发展，大力构建具有中国特色的文明形态对于中华民族的文化建设以及推动中华民族伟大复兴至关重要。另一方面，要善于打破文化交往的壁垒，为世界文化大繁荣大发展贡献中国力量。人类文化本就是一幅各民族文化交相辉映、姹紫嫣红的多彩画卷，文化的交流不仅有利于本民族文化的发展，更是促进世界文化多样性的必要前提。物之不齐，物之情也。世界上没有两片完全相同的树叶，千差万别才符合事物的规律。文化是多样的，人类文化也正是因为多样性才具有相互借鉴的价值。建设中华民族现代文明，要在鼓励中华优秀文化“走出去”的同时，推动世界优秀文化“走进来”，在尊重世界民族不同文化形态差异性的基础上，寻找共同价值、挖掘共通文化，用马克思主义指导不同质的文化形态，以求同存异、开放包容的精神化解质疑、消弭误解，寻求世界文化最大公约数。习近平文化思想“民族”与“世界”的辩证统一，就是要坚持主体性与多样性相融汇，秉持开放包容的价值理念，取人之长补己之短，让文化互鉴超越文化冲突，着力推动世界文化大繁荣大发展。历史已经反复证明，任何阻挡多元文化发展的做法都是自取灭亡，只有在取长补短、交流互鉴中才能实现全人类文化的共同发展。 “明体”与“达用”的辩证统一 明体达用、体用贯通，是对习近平文化思想的准确概括和科学总结。“体”与“用”是中国哲学中的一对重要哲学范畴。“体”是事物的主体，一般指事物的本质、核心，“用”是功用，常表示具体的方式和方法，我们熟悉的“中学为体、西学为用”就是最为常见的表达方式。习近平文化思想中的“明体”主要指习近平文化思想在理论层面的认识与创新，强调的是对新时代文化理论与文化规律的科学认识。党的十八大以来，习近平总书记站在历史和时代的高度，总揽新时代中国特色社会主义文化建设的战略全局，高瞻远瞩地提出了一系列文化建设的新思想、新理念和新观点，形成了习近平文化思想。其中，“九个坚持”加深了当前我们对思想文化工作的规律性认识，揭示了思想文化领域的内在本质规律；“十四个强调”明确了当前文化建设的核心目标，为我们下一步推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国指明了基本方向。“达用”是指习近平文化思想在实践层面的应用和拓展，主要强调了习近平文化思想在中国式现代化发展过程中的实践路径。与“九个坚持”“十四个强调”相对应，习近平文化思想中的“七个着力”侧重于新时代文化工作的统筹部署，为我们指明了文化建设的具体路径与实践方案。同时，习近平文化理论的观点决定了文化建设的实践，而随着文化实践的进一步深入，又会反过来促进人们对文化理论认识的深化和发展。马克思曾指出，“批判的武器当然不能代替武器的批判，物质的力量只能用物质的力量来摧毁”。伟大的思想只有通过实践才可以转化为行动的力量，习近平文化思想也只有通过实践才可以落地生根。习近平文化思想“明体”与“达用”的辩证统一就是将理论与实践相结合，将认识论与方法论相结合，从而实现对新时代宣传思想文化工作的体用贯通。 对历史最好的继承，就是创造新的历史；对文明最大的礼敬，就是创造文明新形态。习近平文化思想坚持守正与创新相结合、坚持党的领导与群众路线相统一、坚持主体性与多样性相融汇、坚持理论与实践相贯通，在实践中深化了对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的深刻认识，展现了习近平文化思想蕴含的哲学意蕴。作为新时代文化建设的重要指导思想，我们必须紧紧围绕学习习近平文化思想，深入贯彻党的二十大关于文化建设的战略部署，切实增强新时代宣传思想文化工作的使命感和责任感，用习近平文化思想凝心铸魂。 （作者系西安邮电大学马克思主义学院讲师）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127000019/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269030.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124131634/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269030.html,2023-11-27 0:00:00,【理响中国】Xi Jinping's Philosophical Implications of Cultural Thought Source：中国社会科学网-中国社会科学报 作者：骞真 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-11-24 21:00:28 0,"Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought is an important part of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, a theoretical generalization and scientific summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction in the new era, and a landmark in the history of the Party's propaganda, ideology and cultural development. As the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought is far-sighted, profound, and rich in connotations, with both epistemology and methodology, and both top-level design and concrete practice, realizing a new leap in the modernization of Marxism in the new era. Among them, ""soul"" and ""root"", ""political party"" and ""masses"", The dialectical features of ""soul"" and ""root"", ""political party"" and ""masses"", ""nation"" and ""world"", ""clear body"" and ""achieve use"" are all intertwined and interconnected, profoundly reflecting Xi Jinping's cultural ideology. This deeply embodies the profound philosophical connotation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, and provides a powerful ideological leadership and action guide for us to continue to promote cultural prosperity, build a strong cultural country, and build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation in the new era. The dialectical unity of ""soul"" and ""root"" It is the solemn mission of the Chinese Communist Party to continuously write a new chapter in the modernization of Marxism. General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed: ""Marxism Chinese modernization of this major proposition itself determines that we must not abandon the soul of Marxism, must not abandon the root of the excellent traditional Chinese culture. Holding fast to this soul and root is the foundation and premise of theoretical innovation."" On the one hand, adhering to the ""soul"" of Marxism is the basis for promoting theoretical innovation. The soul is the unity of the object, and it is difficult to gather gas without a soul. Theoretical innovation should not only follow certain scientific laws, but also have advanced value leadership. For the CPC, Marxism is both a scientific law and a value leader. In scientific laws, Marxism is a correct reflection of the nature and laws of the development of nature, society and human thinking, and the materialist concept of history and the theory of surplus value founded by Marx point out to us the general laws of the development of human society; in value leadership, Marxism is a doctrine of the liberation of the proletariat, and to lead the whole of mankind to realize its own liberation is the ultimate goal of Marxism. Possessing Marxism is the same as possessing truth and value, and it is under the guidance of Marxism's truth and value that we have created a rich and colorful advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. On the other hand, adhering to the ""root"" of the excellent traditional Chinese culture is the premise of theoretical innovation. Roots are the origin of things, and it is difficult to establish oneself without roots. Culture is the deepest and most enduring force of a nation. The reason why the Chinese nation has been able to continue to endure, and to remain new, one of the most important prerequisites is the historical inheritance of the excellent traditional Chinese culture. The values, moral beliefs, family and national sentiments and other cultural factors in the excellent traditional Chinese culture constitute the common ideological system and spiritual core of all Chinese children, which is also an important reason why the Chinese nation can be united and move forward. The dialectical unity of ""soul"" and ""root"" in Xi Jinping's cultural thought is to adhere to the correctness and innovation, and to promote the combination of the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture. The ""second combination"" does not mean that one ""annihilates"" the other, nor does it mean that the two are merged into one, but rather that they are mutually accomplished, mutually activated, and under the influence of the other, each develops in the direction of fusion, and the advanced, scientific standpoint of Marxism guards the correctness of the theory, and the power of Chinese excellent traditional culture is used to create a new theory of Marxism. With the advanced and scientific position of Marxism to keep the correctness of theory, and with the power of excellent traditional Chinese culture to create the newness of culture, both of them work together in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics to consolidate the heart and soul, consolidate the foundation and cultivate the vitality, and stride forward towards the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The dialectical unification of ""political party"" and ""the masses"" Xi Jinping's cultural thought is a shining example of the integration of the party and the masses, and points out the scientific direction for the current cultural construction in China. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""propaganda, ideological and cultural work is an extremely important task that has a bearing on the future destiny of the Party, the long-term stability of the country, and the cohesion and centripetal force of the nation."" On the one hand, Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the prosperity of socialist culture. The CPC is a culture-oriented political party with a high degree of self-awareness. Since the day of its founding, the Party has taken the cause of building the culture of the Chinese nation as its historical mission, united and led the whole nation to develop advanced socialist culture, promoted the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, fostered socialist core values in all aspects, vigorously carried forward the spiritual genealogy of the Chinese Communist Party, which has the great founding spirit as its source, and built the modern civilization of the Chinese nation in practice. It has created a new form of human civilization. Adhering to the Party's leadership in propaganda, ideology and culture means that we must clearly adhere to the Party's control of the media, propaganda and ideology, and the Party media, newspapers and magazines must unconditionally publicize the Party's propositions, and we must firmly grasp the leadership of propaganda, ideology and culture politically, ideologically, and in terms of values, so as to build a socialist ideology that is strong in cohesion and leading power. On the other hand, the mass line is the fundamental working line of our Party to promote cultural construction. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized, ""We should take meeting the people's spiritual and cultural needs as the starting and ending point of literature and art and literary work, take the people as the main body of literary and artistic expression, take the people as connoisseurs and judges of literary and artistic aesthetics, and take serving the people as the vocation of literary and artistic workers."" The people are the creators and participants of literary and artistic works, and deserve to be the enjoyers of literary and artistic works. Adhering to the mass line means firmly establishing a mass viewpoint, allowing the people to freely and consciously participate in the activities of cultural creation, feeling the deeper and more enduring power of culture, and constantly satisfying the people's needs for spiritual culture. Xi Jinping's cultural thought fully manifests the CPC's people-centered value stance, profoundly answers the core questions of cultural construction, and comprehensively reflects General Secretary Xi Jinping's profound people's sentiment. The dialectical unity of the ""political party"" and the ""masses"" means that we must adhere to the unity of the Party's leadership and the mass line, deal with the relationship between the ""fundamental leadership"" and the ""fundamental position"", and profoundly understand the relationship between the ""fundamental leadership"" and the ""fundamental position"" of the CPC. The dialectical unity of the Party and the masses is to insist on the unity of the Party's leadership and the mass line, to deal with the relationship between ""fundamental leadership"" and ""fundamental standpoint"", to profoundly answer the principled and fundamental questions of ""who should lead"" and ""for whom should the leadership be given"", and to give new philosophical connotations to the Marxist conception of materialistic history in practice. The dialectical unity of ""nation"" and ""world"" Culture is both national and global. General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that it is not spring for one flower to bloom alone, but for a hundred flowers to bloom together, the garden will be full of spring. If there is only one kind of flower in the world, even if it is beautiful, it is still monotonous. Both the Chinese civilization and other civilizations that exist in the world are the fruits of human civilization's creation. On the one hand, we should vigorously build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation, which is the mission and task of the current cultural construction in China. The modern civilization of the Chinese nation is a new form of human civilization created by the CPC under the leadership of the whole nation in the process of realizing Chinese-style modernization, and it is an innovative product of the ""two combinations"". At present, as the world's great change unprecedented in a century accelerates, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation enters a critical period, and the wave of informationization in the digital era develops rapidly, vigorously constructing a civilization with Chinese characteristics is crucial to the cultural construction of the Chinese nation as well as the promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. On the other hand, we should be good at breaking down the barriers of cultural exchanges and contributing Chinese power to the great prosperity and development of world culture. Human culture is a colorful picture of the interplay of various national cultures, and cultural exchanges are not only conducive to the development of national culture, but also a necessary prerequisite for the promotion of cultural diversity in the world. Things are not all the same, and so are the feelings of things. There are no two leaves in the world that are exactly the same, and it is only in accordance with the law of things that they vary greatly. Culture is diverse, and it is precisely because of this diversity that human cultures have the value of mutual reference. To build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation, we should encourage the excellent Chinese culture to ""go out"" and at the same time promote the excellent culture of the world to ""come in"", and on the basis of respecting the differences of the different cultural forms of the world's nationalities, we should search for common values, dig for common culture, and use Marxism to guide the different cultures. Marxism should be used to guide different cultural forms, and the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, openness and tolerance should be used to resolve doubts and misunderstandings, and to seek the greatest common denominator of the world's cultures. The dialectical unity of ""nation"" and ""world"" in Xi Jinping's cultural thought means that we should adhere to the integration of subjectivity and diversity, uphold the value of openness and tolerance, take the strengths of others to make up for our own shortcomings, and let cultural mutual understanding transcend cultural conflicts, so as to vigorously promote the great prosperity and development of world culture. We will strive to promote the great prosperity and development of world culture. History has repeatedly proved that any obstruction to the development of multiculturalism is self-defeating, and that only through complementing one another's strengths and exchanging and learning can we realize the common development of all human cultures. The dialectical unity of ""understanding the body"" and ""attaining the use"" is an accurate generalization and scientific summary of Xi Jinping's cultural thought. ""Body"" and ""use"" are a pair of important philosophical categories in Chinese philosophy. ""Body"" is the main body of a thing, which generally refers to the essence and core of the thing, and ""use"" is the function, which often indicates specific ways and methods, and we are familiar with the expression ""Middle school is the body, and Western learning is the use"". This is the most common way of expression. In Xi Jinping's cultural thought, the term ""Ming body"" mainly refers to the understanding and innovation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought at the theoretical level, emphasizing the scientific understanding of cultural theories and cultural laws in the new era. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has stood on the height of history and the times, taken a broad view of the strategic overall situation of the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and farsightedly put forward a series of new ideas, concepts, and perspectives on cultural construction, which have formed Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought. Among them, the ""nine adherences"" have deepened our understanding of the regularity of ideological and cultural work and revealed the intrinsic laws of the ideological and cultural fields; the ""fourteen emphases"" have clarified the core objectives of the current cultural construction, and pointed out the basic direction for us to promote the prosperity of culture and build a strong cultural country, The ""fourteen emphases"" have clarified the core objectives of the current cultural construction, pointing out the basic direction for us to promote cultural prosperity and build a strong cultural country. The ""Da Yu"" refers to the application and expansion of Xi Jinping's cultural thought at the practical level, mainly emphasizing the practical path of Xi Jinping's cultural thought in the process of Chinese-style modernization and development. In contrast to the ""nine adherences"" and ""fourteen emphases,"" the ""seven efforts"" in Xi's cultural thought focus on the overall deployment of cultural work in the new era, pointing out the specific path and practical solutions for cultural construction. Xi Jinping's cultural thought ""seven efforts"" focuses on the overall deployment of cultural work in the new era, pointing out the specific path and practical program for cultural construction. At the same time, Xi Jinping's viewpoints on cultural theory determine the practice of cultural construction, and with the further deepening of cultural practice, it will in turn promote the deepening and development of people's understanding of cultural theory. Marx once pointed out that ""the weapon of criticism can certainly not replace the criticism of the weapon, and the power of matter can only be destroyed by the power of matter."" Great ideas can only be transformed into the power of action through practice, and Xi Jinping's cultural thought can only take root through practice. The dialectical unity of Xi Jinping's cultural thought is to combine theory and practice, epistemology and methodology, so as to realize the body and application of propaganda and ideological and cultural work in the new era. The best way to inherit history is to create a new history; the greatest tribute to civilization is to create a new form of civilization. Xi Jinping's cultural thought adheres to the combination of observance and innovation, the unity of Party leadership and mass line, the integration of subjectivity and diversity, and the coherence of theory and practice, deepening the profound understanding of the laws of socialist cultural construction with Chinese characteristics in practice, and demonstrating the philosophical implications embedded in Xi Jinping's cultural thought. As an important guiding ideology for cultural construction in the new era, we must closely focus on learning Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, deeply implement the strategic deployment of the 20th Party Congress on cultural construction, effectively enhance the sense of mission and responsibility for propaganda and ideological and cultural work in the new era, and use Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought to strengthen the heart and soul.

发展效能的转型升级——怎么看全面加强军事治理 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：董俊林 徐学文 傅达林 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-24 06:52:40 0,发展效能的转型升级 ——怎么看全面加强军事治理 国家以治为盛，军队以治为胜。党的二十大报告提出，“全面加强军事治理”，体现了我们党对新时代建军治军规律的深刻把握。我军提高发展效能、增强制胜优势，全面加强军事治理至关重要。新征程上，我们要强化使命担当，发扬改革创新精神，全面加强军事治理，以军事治理新加强助推强军事业新发展。 为什么要以高水平治理推动我军高质量发展？ 当前，我国国防和军队建设投入加大，分工越来越细，军事系统运行整体性、协同性、复杂性显著上升，对军事治理要求越来越高。全面加强军事治理是我们党治军理念和方式的一场深刻变革，是加快国防和军队现代化的战略要求，是推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化的重要方面。必须坚持全局统筹、系统抓建、体系治理，加强国防和军队建设各项工作协调联动，确保同向发力、综合发力，以提高军事系统运行效能。 时下，我军建设正处在提质增效的关键阶段，既面临赶超跨越的繁重任务，也面临差距拉大的严峻挑战，发展慢了不行，质量不高更不行。我们必须全面加强军事治理，坚持把高质量发展放在首位，转变发展理念、创新发展模式、增强发展动能，抓住窗口期，跑出加速度，才能推动国防和军队现代化建设由“量”的增值转向“质”的提升。 如何认识巩固拓展国防和军队改革成果？ 物不因不生，不革不成。深化国防和军队改革大开大合、大破大立、蹄疾步稳，这一轮改革任务基本完成，但改革效能尚未充分释放，谋划推进后续改革工作还需持续用力。我们要始终保持改革的定力、恒心、韧劲，坚持方向不变、道路不偏、力度不减，把改革进行到底。 军事力量结构编成加速完善。随着军事力量结构编成改革不断深化，越来越多的新型作战力量加入各军兵种部队编制序列。操控室内，战机飞行员出身的无人机“掌舵者”，精准控制无人机飞行姿态；云海间，巡弋待战的无人机侦测发现“敌方”车辆，发射导弹精准命中。这是无人机部队实战化演训的一个场景。军事力量结构编成不能固定不变，必须随着战争形态和作战方式的变化而变化。要积极适应战争形态向信息化智能化战争演变的时代潮流，推动军事力量结构编成多域优化、纵深发展，持续打造以精锐作战力量为主体的军事力量体系，为赢得军事竞争优势提供有力支撑。 军事政策制度体系优化。近年来，我军十分注重健全完善包括军事力量运用政策制度在内的各方面军事政策制度，中国特色社会主义军事政策制度体系不断完善。“请大家放心，我们来了，大家安全了！”2023年，中国军舰紧急赴苏丹撤侨的视频击中了亿万同胞的泪点。从2011年利比亚撤侨、2015年也门撤侨再到此次苏丹撤侨，人民军队响应越来越迅捷，应对越来越成熟，这背后既有我军遂行非战争军事行动能力的不断提升，也有国内法和相关国际法等法规制度的有力支撑。时代在变，国防和军队现代化建设的内容和要求也在不断迭代升级，必须体系优化军事政策制度，打造我军党的建设制度、军事力量运用政策制度、军事力量建设政策制度、军事管理政策制度的“升级版”，以制度创造力赢得国防和军队现代化发展竞争力。 军队院校改革持续深化。治军先治校，强军必强校。这一轮改革以来，院校教育走上了内涵式发展的快车道，万千学员在这里淬炼成才、从这里走向战场。2022年盛夏，海军某潜艇基地副参谋长刚完成深海潜航训练不久，就走上海军指挥学院的讲台。他结合练兵一线热气腾腾的成果，将一堂潜艇作战运用课讲得精彩纷呈，学员们直呼“解渴”。高中级指挥员执教军校，从讲座介绍向嵌入教学转变、实现与教学大纲无缝对接，是我军深化院校教育改革、建立院校部队合力育人新格局的重要举措。当前，我军院校建设还面临一些需要深入解决的矛盾和问题，必须乘势而上、持续发力，拿出改革创新的思路和办法，抓好院校改革后续任务落实，加快办学模式和运行机制创新，推动院校建设加快转型升级，不断提高办学水平和人才培养质量。 为什么要加强依法治军机制建设？ 清代史学家赵翼总结历代贿赂现象后得出一个结论，叫“贿随权集”，腐败总是和权力如影随形。把权力关进笼子里，既要靠完备的制度，又要靠健全的机制。2022年6月，中央军委机关有关部门印发12个重点行业领域权力运行制约和监管规定，通过分权、共管、监审、公开、问责等刚性措施办法，探索形成后勤、装备系统权力运行全流程、全领域、全方位监管的体制机制。贯彻依法治军战略，提高国防和军队建设法治化水平，健全完善的体制机制是重要抓手。依法治军不是单项业务工作，而是覆盖国防和军队建设各领域，涉及立法、执法、司法、监督、用法各环节，只有建立起健全的落实机制，“纸上的法律”才会成为“行动中的法律”。 党的十八大以来，依法治军实践取得重大进展。全军制定出台200多部军事法律法规，构建起军事法规制度体系的基本框架，形成系统完备、严密高效的军事法规制度体系、军事法治实施体系、军事法治监督体系、军事法治保障体系，推动治军方式实现根本性转变，为推进强军事业提供了坚强法治保障。同时要看到，强军兴军步伐很快，在主战链路上以法为纲助力备战打仗，在主建链路上以法为纲释放强军效能，推动部队建设进一步聚焦主责主业、提高管理水平、激发活力动力等，都需要不断推进依法治军机制建设。比如，要完善依法治军组织领导机制，优化军事立法工作机制，健全军事法规制度实施和监督机制，推动建设依法治军军地协调机制，探索建立依法治军考核评估机制，建立健全涉外军事法治工作机制，等等。这样才能把依法治军战略落到实处，确保军队建设在法治轨道上推进，形成党委依法决策、机关依法指导、部队依法行动、官兵依法履职的良好局面。 为什么要加紧构建现代军事物流体系和军队现代资产管理体系？ 统筹统供、共享共用。“公物仓”这个新生事物，为部队物资保障带来新变化。陆军某旅一名参谋在筹备活动期间，登录“公物仓”管理信息系统，线上搜索并选定提交所需物资清单，各类设备器材很快从“公物仓”调用到位。“公物仓”将办公类和训练类等闲置资产全部入仓，打破建制界限共享共用，有效解决了部队“搬家式”驻训、“逢训必买”，突击式大供大补、大拆大建等问题，帮助部队轻装上阵、快速备战。资产可视化系统已经上线运行，所有资产编目赋码有了唯一“身份证”，实现全部入网、状态可视，“一键提需求、一链通环节、一站送到位”的保障模式正在形成。 建设现代军事物流体系和军队现代资产管理体系，是加快建设现代化后勤的战略抓手，是构建一体化联合作战综合保障体系的重点任务。现代军事物流体系，主要是将物资的筹、运、储、供及军事力量投送作为一个有机整体，全流程管理、全系统优化而形成的新型物资保障体系，侧重于供应链，重点解决供应物资从哪来、送哪去、送多少、怎么送等问题。军队现代资产管理体系，主要是扭住资产进入、使用、退出三个环节，按照全口径、全寿命、全成本和规范化管理要求，让资产资源科学高效使用的管理体系，侧重于管理链，重点解决资产有什么、有多少、在哪里、怎么管等问题。“两大体系”互为支撑、密不可分，基本特征就是系统集成、信息主导、强化标准、军民融合，目标指向就是建设联合、精干、高效的后勤，聚力强军、保障打赢。 事实证明，战争形态越发展，作战对后勤的依赖性就越大。打现代战争，必须建设现代化后勤，加强后勤军事治理，聚力创新转型，突出规范集约，扭住现代军事物流体系和军队现代资产管理体系建设不放松，加紧破解后勤保障短板弱项，加快推动现代后勤高质量发展，才能以强大的保障力催生强大的战斗力。 （执笔：董俊林、徐学文、傅达林）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127000019/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268974.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231124073452/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16268974.html,2023-11-27 0:00:00,Transformation and Upgrading of Development Effectiveness--How to See the Comprehensive Strengthening of Military Governance Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Dong Junlin Xu Xuewen Fu Dalin Responsibility: Sun Yue 2023-11-24 06:52:40 0,"The Transformation and Upgrading of Development Effectiveness - What to Say About Comprehensively Strengthening Military Governance A country thrives on governance, and an army wins with governance. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress proposes ""comprehensively strengthening military governance"", reflecting the Party's profound grasp of the laws of army building and governance in the new era. It is vital to strengthen military governance in a comprehensive manner in order to improve the development effectiveness of our army and enhance its winning edge. On the new journey, we need to strengthen our mission, carry forward the spirit of reform and innovation, comprehensively strengthen military governance, and promote the new development of the cause of a strong army with a new strengthening of military governance. Why is it necessary to promote the high-quality development of our military with a high level of governance? At present, China's national defense and military construction investment, the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed, the military system operation integrality, synergism, complexity of a significant rise in military governance requirements are increasingly high. Comprehensively strengthening military governance is a profound change in the Party's philosophy and way of governing the military, a strategic requirement for accelerating the modernization of national defense and the military, and an important aspect of promoting the modernization of the country's governance system and governance capacity. It is necessary to adhere to the overall coordination, systematic construction and systematic governance, strengthen the coordination and linkage of national defense and military construction work, and ensure that the same direction and comprehensive force is exerted to improve the operational effectiveness of the military system. At present, our military construction is in the key stage of improving quality and efficiency, facing the heavy task of catching up and leapfrogging, but also facing the serious challenge of widening the gap, the development of a slow no, the quality is not high even more. We must comprehensively strengthen military governance, adhere to the high-quality development in the first place, change the development concept, innovative development model, enhance the development of kinetic energy, seize the window period, run out of acceleration, in order to promote the modernization of the national defense and military construction from the ""quantity"" of value-added to the ""quality"" enhancement. The only way to promote the modernization of national defense and military construction from ""quantitative"" value-added to ""qualitative"" improvement. How to understand the consolidation and expansion of national defense and military reform results? Things don't come into being without a cause, and they don't come into being without reform. Deepening the reform of national defense and the military is wide open, big break, big and steady, this round of reform tasks are basically completed, but the effectiveness of the reform has not yet been fully released, planning to promote the follow-up reform work needs to continue to exert force. We should always maintain the determination, perseverance and tenacity of the reform, adhere to the same direction, the road will not be biased, the intensity will not be reduced, and the reform will be carried out to the end. The structure and organization of military forces are being improved at an accelerated pace. With the deepening of the reform of the structure of military forces, more and more new types of combat forces have been added to the establishment sequence of each military service. Inside the control room, the drone ""helmsman"" from the fighter pilot precisely controls the drone's flight attitude; between the clouds and the sea, the drone cruising for battle detects and discovers the ""enemy"" vehicle, and launches missiles to hit accurately. This is a scene from the drone unit's combat-oriented training. The structure of military forces can not be fixed, must change with the changes in the war form and mode of combat. To actively adapt to the war pattern to information technology intelligent war evolution of the trend of the times, to promote the structure of the military force formation of multi-domain optimization, deep development, and continue to build the main body of the elite combat forces of the military force system, in order to win the military competitive advantage to provide strong support. Optimization of military policy and system. In recent years, our army has paid great attention to improve all aspects of military policy system, including the policy system for the use of military forces, and the system of socialist military policy system with Chinese characteristics has been continuously improved. ""Please rest assured that we are here and everyone is safe!"" In 2023, the video of a Chinese warship's emergency trip to Sudan to evacuate overseas Chinese hit the tear spot of hundreds of millions of compatriots. From the Libyan evacuation in 2011, the Yemeni evacuation in 2015 to the Sudanese evacuation, the people's army has become more and more swift in its response and more and more mature in its response, behind which there is not only the continuous improvement of the army's ability to attempt military operations other than war, but also the strong support of the domestic law and relevant international law and other regulations and systems. Times are changing, and the content and requirements of national defense and military modernization are constantly being upgraded, so it is necessary to systematically optimize the military policy and system, and create an upgraded version of the Party construction system, military force application policy and system, military force construction policy and system, and military management policy and system, so that we can win the competitiveness of the modernization and development of national defense and the military through institutional creativity. Modernization and development of national defense and military competitiveness will be won through institutional creativity. The reform of military colleges and universities continues to deepen. The first step in governing the military is to govern the schools, and to strengthen the military, the schools must be strengthened. Since this round of reform, the education of institutions has embarked on the fast track of connotative development, thousands of students here to refine their talents, from here to the battlefield.2022 summer, a submarine base of the Navy deputy chief of staff has just completed the deep-sea submarine training, on the podium of the Naval Command College. He combined with the results of the practice of the first line of hot air, a submarine combat use of the class is wonderful, the students called ""quench"". High school commanders teaching military schools, from lectures to embedded teaching changes, to achieve a seamless connection with the syllabus, is the military to deepen the reform of institutional education, the establishment of institutions and forces to establish a new pattern of joint efforts to educate people important initiatives. At present, the construction of our military institutions is still facing a number of contradictions and problems that need to be resolved in depth, and it is necessary to take advantage of the momentum and continue to make efforts to come up with ideas and methods of reform and innovation, to grasp the implementation of the follow-up tasks of the institutional reform, to accelerate the innovation of the mode of school running and operation mechanism, to promote the acceleration of the transformation and upgrading of the construction of the institutions, and to continuously improve the level of school running and quality of personnel training. Why is it necessary to strengthen the construction of the mechanism of governing the military according to law? Zhao Yi, a historian of the Qing Dynasty, summarized the phenomenon of bribery through the ages and came to a conclusion called ""bribery follows power"", corruption always follows power. To put the power in the cage, we need to rely on both a complete system and a sound mechanism.2022 In June, the relevant departments of the Central Military Commission issued 12 key industrial areas of power operation constraints and supervision regulations, through the separation of powers, co-management, supervision and review, openness, accountability, and other rigid measures, to explore the formation of the logistical, equipment system, the power operation of the whole process, the whole field, the full range of supervision of the system and the mechanism. Implementing the strategy of ruling the military according to law, and improving the level of rule of law in national defense and military construction, a sound and perfect institutional mechanism is an important grasp. Rule of law is not a single business, but covers all areas of national defense and military construction, involving legislation, law enforcement, justice, supervision, and usage of all aspects, only to establish a sound implementation mechanism, ""the law on paper"" will become ""the law in action"". Since the 18th CPC National Congress, significant progress has been made in the practice of governing the military according to law. The army has formulated and introduced more than 200 military laws and regulations, built up the basic framework of military regulations and systems, formed a systematic, complete, strict and efficient military regulations and systems, military rule of law implementation system, military rule of law supervision system, military rule of law protection system, to promote the way of governance of the army to achieve a fundamental change, to promote the cause of the strong army to provide a strong rule of law guarantee. At the same time, we should see that the army is very fast pace, in the main battle chain on the law as a program to help prepare for war, in the main building chain on the law as a program to release the effectiveness of the army, to promote the construction of the army to further focus on the main responsibilities of the main business, improve the level of management, stimulate the vitality of motivation, etc., need to continue to promote the mechanism of military rule by law construction. For example, to improve the organization and leadership mechanism of governing the military according to law, optimize the working mechanism of military legislation, improve the implementation and supervision mechanism of military regulations and systems, promote the construction of the military coordination mechanism of governing the military according to law, explore the establishment of the assessment and evaluation mechanism of governing the military according to law, and establish and improve the mechanism of the rule of law for foreign military work, and so on. In this way, we can put the strategy of governing the military according to law into practice, ensure that the military construction is promoted on the track of the rule of law, and form a good situation in which the party committee makes decisions according to law, the organs are guided according to law, the troops act according to law, and the officers and soldiers fulfill their duties according to law. Why should we step up the construction of a modern military logistics system and a modern asset management system for the army? The first step is to integrate the supply of goods and to share and utilize them. The ""public goods warehouse"" is a new thing, bringing new changes to the army's material security. An army brigade a staff officer in the preparation of the event, log on the ""public goods warehouse"" management information system, online search and selected to submit a list of required materials, various types of equipment and equipment quickly from the ""public goods warehouse"" call in place. ""Public goods warehouse"" will be office and training class and other idle assets all into the warehouse, breaking the establishment boundaries of sharing and common use, an effective solution to the troops ""moving type"" training, ""training must buy"", surprise This effectively solves the problems of ""moving"" troops in training, ""buying every time they train"", and ""big supply and big repair"" and ""big dismantling and big construction"", and helps the troops to be lightly loaded and quickly prepare for war. The asset visualization system has been put into operation, and all assets have been catalogued and coded with a unique ""ID card"", so as to realize that all of them are on the network and their status is visible, and the protection mode of ""one key to raise demand, one chain to pass links, and one stop to deliver"" is taking shape. The construction of a modern military logistics system and the army's modern asset management system is to accelerate the construction of a modernized logistics strategy, is to build an integrated joint combat comprehensive security system key tasks. Modern military logistics system, mainly the material planning, transportation, storage, supply and military force delivery as an organic whole, the whole process management, whole system optimization and the formation of a new type of material security system, focusing on the supply chain, focusing on solving the supply of materials from where to send where to send how much to send, how to send and other issues. The army's modern asset management system is mainly to twist the assets into, use, exit three links, in accordance with the full-caliber, full-life, full-cost and standardized management requirements, so that the scientific and efficient use of assets and resources management system, focusing on the management chain, focusing on solving the problem of what the assets have, how many, where, how to manage and so on. ""The two systems are mutually supportive and inseparable, and their basic features are system integration, information-led, strengthened standards, and civil-military integration, with the goal of building a joint, streamlined, and highly efficient logistics, focusing on strengthening the military and guaranteeing a win-win situation. Facts have proved that the more the war pattern develops, the greater the dependence of combat on logistics. Fighting a modern war, we must build modern logistics, strengthen the military governance of logistics, focus on innovation and transformation, highlighting the standardization and intensification, twisting the construction of modern military logistics system and the army's modern asset management system, step up to crack the shortcomings and weaknesses of the logistical support, accelerate the high-quality development of modern logistics, so as to give birth to a powerful combat force with strong protection. (Author: Dong Junlin, Xu Xuewen, Fu Dalin)","The article discusses the importance of transforming and upgrading the development effectiveness of the military, highlighting the need for comprehensive strengthening of military governance. This involves improving the quality and efficiency of national defense and military construction, adapting to the trend of war and the evolution of information technology, optimizing the structure and organization of military forces, improving policies and systems, and strengthening the education and training of military personnel. Additionally, the construction of a modern logistics system and asset management system is crucial to improving the winning edge of the military."

Through the theme of education to guide the majority of officers and soldiers to learn the history of inspiration, a deep understanding of the importance of hard work, consciously the hard work of this ""heirloom"" inherited from generation to generation. In the daily work to develop the behavior of hard work habits. Hard work is not a slogan, must be implemented into the daily work life. Currently, by the long-term impact of the peaceful environment, some officers and soldiers, to varying degrees, there are ""proud and delicate"" two gas, individual to ""lie flat"" ""Buddha"" often hanging on the side of the mouth. Leaders to practice the spirit of hard work as an important part of ideological and political work, education officers and soldiers to take the initiative to abandon thrift and frugality is ""shabby"", hard work and simplicity is ""earthy"", generous is ""generous"" and other misconceptions.

This tradition includes frugal living, thrifty attitudes, and the political advantage of the People's Army's continuous development and growth. It is necessary to pass on this spirit to promote the cause of a strong army in the new era, especially in the face of risks and challenges. This can be achieved through theoretical study, inheritance of the red gene, daily work habits, and establishment of rules and regulations. To ensure the implementation of the spirit of hard work, a long-term mechanism needs to be established.

长城论坛丨工作筹划要坚持辩证思维 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：袁百舸 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-29 06:45:09 0,工作筹划要坚持辩证思维 ■袁百舸 思深方益远，谋定而后动。年终岁尾，不少领导机关都在盘点今年得失、筹划明年工作。如何通过年度工作筹划，进一步统一思想、理清思路、明确要求、把握重点？笔者认为，一个重要方面，就是讲点辩证法。 习主席多次强调，要学习掌握唯物辩证法的根本方法，不断增强辩证思维能力，提高驾驭复杂局面、处理复杂问题的本领。我党我军历来提倡按照辩证法办事，搞好年度工作筹划也不例外。成功赖于筹划，事业成于筹划。年度工作筹划不仅仅是设计几项具体工作，还是对标对表、看齐追随的过程，是认清形势、找准定位的过程，是盘点过往得失、明确发力重点的过程。只有善于处理好局部和全局、当前和长远、重点和非重点的关系，分清大小难易、明确轻重缓急、摸清内在规律，才能“审大小而图之，酌缓急而布之”，为新年度描绘出指引前进的“路线图”、指导工作的“规划图”。 做好年度工作筹划，需要正确处理补短板与扬长处的关系。每个单位在整体建设上都不同程度地存在长处和短板，这种“长”和“短”并非一成不变的。长处是单位的优势所在、底气所在，但不能当作一劳永逸的存在。长处不扬会变短，短板若补会变长。“短板”效应告诉我们，只有把这些短板补齐、痛点打通，部队战斗力才能得到大的提升，各项建设才能实现新的飞跃。正如习主席所说，“要坚持辩证思维，转变观念，努力把短板变成‘潜力板’”。年度工作筹划时，领导机关既要扬长处也要补短板，把短板作为攻坚克难的重点，一个一个加长，努力化短板为“潜力板”，变痛点为“增长点”。 “删繁就简三秋树，领异标新二月花。”年度工作筹划自然当有新目标、呈现新气象、勇攀新高度，适当提速加压有利于部队的发展进步。但是任何事情都过犹不及，在做加法、压担子的同时也不能贪多求全。一年的时间是固定的，基层官兵的精力是有限的，如果在工作筹划时不做取舍一味加码，安排的活动过多、指标过高、任务过重，就会使基层分散精力、疲于奔命，反倒无益。领导机关在工作筹划时，应坚持实事求是之意，不搞虚荣浮夸，在做加法的同时不忘做减法。想想哪些会议可以不开、哪些活动可以不搞、哪些文件可以不发……这些减法，对基层官兵而言，是松绑减负；对战斗力而言，是添薪助力。 工作筹划中，还要注意考虑工作的轻重缓急。部队工作千头万绪，大致可以分出既重要又紧迫、重要而不紧迫、不重要但紧迫几种类型。根据工作性质不同采取不同对策，这原本不错，但实际情况是，有很多重要而不紧迫的工作，往往因为时间要求不太急，便容易一拖再拖。比如读书学习、基层建设、人才培养等，短时间内不真抓、不实抓，负面效果一时也显现不出来，就容易陷入“说起来重要，做起来次要，忙起来不要”的窘境。抓好这些重要而不紧迫的工作不可能一蹴而就、一劳永逸，容不得临渴掘井、临阵磨枪、临机而发。领导机关在筹划工作时就应以“功成不必在我，功成必定有我”的精神，重视这些重要而不紧迫的工作，做到有规划、有思路、有检查、有考评，努力为部队的长远发展打下扎实基础。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130001000/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269732.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231129103646/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269732.html,2023-11-30 0:00:00,Great Wall Forum丨Work planning should adhere to dialectical thinking Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Yuan Baige Responsibility: Sun Yue 2023-11-29 06:45:09 0,"Work planning to adhere to the dialectical thinking ■ Yuan Baige Think deep Fang Yi far, planning to move. At the end of the year, many leading organizations are taking stock of this year's gains and losses, planning for next year's work. How to plan through the annual work, further unify thinking, clear thinking, clear requirements, grasp the focus? The author believes that an important aspect, is to speak a little dialectic. President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the need to learn to master the fundamental method of material dialectics, and constantly enhance the ability to think dialectically, improve the ability to manage complex situations and deal with complex issues. Our party and our army have always advocated in accordance with the dialectical approach, and good annual work planning is no exception. Success depends on planning, career into planning. Annual work planning is not only to design a few specific work, or the process of benchmarking, alignment and follow, is to recognize the situation, the process of positioning, is to take stock of the past gains and losses, clear focus on the process. Only good at dealing with the local and global, current and long-term, key and non-key relationships, clear size and difficulty, clear priorities, understand the inner law, in order to ""review the size of the map, discretionary urgency and cloth"" for the new year to draw a guide to move forward, ""roadmap "", to guide the work of the ""plan"". Do a good job of annual work planning, need to correctly deal with the shortcomings and strengths of the relationship. Each unit in the overall construction of varying degrees of strengths and shortcomings, this ""long"" and ""short"" is not static. Strengths are the unit's strengths, where the bottom line is, but can not be taken as a permanent presence. Strengths do not promote will become short, if the short board to make up will become long. The ""short board"" effect tells us that only to make up these short boards, pain points through, the combat effectiveness of the troops can be greatly improved, the construction can realize a new leap. As President Xi said, ""We should adhere to dialectical thinking, change our mindset, and strive to turn short boards into 'potential boards'"". Annual work planning, the leadership should not only Yang strengths but also to make up for the shortcomings, the shortcomings as the focus of the attack, one by one, and strive to make the shortcomings into a ""potential board"", and change the pain point into a ""growth point"". ""To cut the complexity and simplify the three autumn trees, leading the different standard new February flowers."" Annual work planning naturally when there are new goals, presenting a new atmosphere, the courage to scale new heights, appropriate speed and pressure is conducive to the development and progress of the troops. But anything is too much, in the addition, pressure burden at the same time can not be greedy for more. A year's time is fixed, grass-roots officers and men's energy is limited, if you do not make trade-offs in the work of planning to increase the code, the arrangement of too many activities, indicators are too high, the task is too heavy, will make the grass-roots dispersal of energy, fatigue, in turn, unhelpful. Leading authorities in the work of planning, should adhere to the intention of seeking truth from facts, do not engage in vanity and pomposity, do not forget to subtract while adding. Think about which meetings can not open, which activities can not be engaged in, which documents can not be issued ...... these subtractions, the grass-roots officers and soldiers, is to untie the burden; on the combat effectiveness, is to add pay help. Work planning, but also pay attention to consider the priority of work. The work of the troops are many and varied, can be roughly divided into both important and urgent, important and not urgent, not important but urgent several types. According to the different nature of the work to take different measures, which is good, but the actual situation is that there are many important but not urgent work, often because of the time requirements are not too urgent, it is easy to procrastinate again and again. For example, reading and learning, grass-roots construction, talent development, etc., within a short period of time do not really grasp, do not grasp, the negative effects of a moment can not be seen, it is easy to fall into the ""said to be important, do the secondary, busy do not want"" dilemma. Grasp these important but not urgent work can not be accomplished overnight, once and for all, do not allow the thirst to dig a well, the formation of the gun, the opportunity to send. The leading authorities in the planning of work should be ""success does not have to be in me, success must have my"" spirit, pay attention to these important and not urgent work, so that there is planning, ideas, inspection, evaluation, and strive to lay a solid foundation for the long-term development of the force.","The article discusses the importance of incorporating dialectical thinking in work planning, particularly in navigating complex situations and achieving long-term success. It highlights the need to recognize strengths and weaknesses, prioritize tasks, and make trade-offs to optimize resources for best outcomes."
长城瞭望丨加强价值引领 提供精神支撑 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：沈  蓓  梁赢中 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-29 06:44:25 0,加强价值引领 提供精神支撑 ——以习近平文化思想为引领开创宣传思想文化工作新局面③ ■沈  蓓  梁赢中 全国宣传思想文化工作会议最重要的成果，就是正式提出和系统阐述习近平文化思想，在党的宣传思想文化事业发展史上具有里程碑意义。会议还明确要求广泛践行社会主义核心价值观，改进创新精神文明建设工作。我们应全面学习贯彻习近平文化思想，深入学习领会习主席关于培育和践行社会主义核心价值观的重要论述，进一步立精神之柱、树价值标杆、育时代新人，为中国式现代化提供价值引领，为全体人民团结奋斗提供精神支撑。 核心价值观，承载着一个民族、一个国家的精神追求，体现着一个社会评判是非曲直的价值标准。人类社会发展的历史表明，对一个民族、一个国家来说，最持久、最深层的力量是全社会共同认可的核心价值观。如果没有共同的核心价值观，一个民族、一个国家就会魂无定所、行无依归。正如习主席所说，“核心价值观是一个国家的重要稳定器，能否构建具有强大感召力的核心价值观，关系社会和谐稳定，关系国家长治久安”。 社会主义核心价值观植根于中华文化沃土，熔铸于我们党领导人民长期奋斗的伟大实践，凝结着全体人民共同的价值追求，是凝聚人心、汇聚民力的强大力量。习主席对宣传思想文化工作作出“七个着力”的重要指示，其中之一是“着力培育和践行社会主义核心价值观”。在强国建设、民族复兴的新征程上，社会思想意识和价值理念日益多元多样多变，需要我们进一步发挥社会主义核心价值观的引领作用，进一步强化教育引导、实践养成、制度保障，把社会主义核心价值观融入法治建设、融入社会发展、融入日常生活，更好构筑中国精神、中国价值、中国力量。 习主席指出：“当高楼大厦在我国大地上遍地林立时，中华民族精神的大厦也应该巍然耸立。”物质文明和精神文明是人类认识世界、改造世界全部成果的总括和结晶。没有坚实、先进的物质文明，一个国家和民族就会缺乏昂首于世的物质基础。党的十八大以来，党中央、习主席把精神文明建设贯穿改革开放和现代化全过程、渗透社会生活各方面，全面展开精神文明建设各项工作，取得了巨大成就。实践证明，只有物质文明建设和精神文明建设都搞好，国家物质力量和精神力量都增强，全国各族人民物质生活和精神生活都改善，中国特色社会主义事业才能顺利向前推进。 中国式现代化的一个突出特色，就是物质文明和精神文明相协调的现代化。在中国共产党领导下建设的社会主义现代化强国，不仅要在物质上强，更要在精神上强。这就要求我们在推进和拓展中国式现代化的历史进程中，将物质文明的发展与精神文明的进步统一起来，更加坚定、更加自觉地推动“两个文明”协调发展，不断增强新形势下“两手抓、两手都要硬”的思想自觉、政治自觉、行动自觉，努力促进物的全面丰富和人的全面发展。 我军作为一支无产阶级性质的新型人民军队，从创建之日起，就牢记党和人民的嘱托，坚持把“培养什么人、怎样培养人”作为政治工作的主要内容，引导官兵始终保持鲜明的政治立场、坚定的信仰信念、崇高的革命精神、优良的作风纪律，在践行社会主义核心价值观、加强精神文明建设上始终走在前列。这不仅为我军发展壮大、克敌制胜提供了强大思想保证和重要力量源泉，而且对全民族产生了巨大精神影响，为社会文明进步作出了重大贡献。人无精神则不立，国无精神则不强。这种政治优势、精神优势，熔铸成了人民军队的制胜优势。 “万物得其本者生，百事得其道者成。”培育和践行社会主义核心价值观是凝魂聚气、强基固本的基础工程。各级应坚持以德树人、以文化人，推动理想信念教育常态化制度化，大力弘扬以伟大建党精神为源头的中国共产党人精神谱系，深化中国特色社会主义和中国梦强军梦宣传教育，弘扬以爱国主义为核心的民族精神和以改革创新为核心的时代精神。深入开展社会主义核心价值观宣传教育，持久培育当代革命军人核心价值观，广泛开展社会公德、职业道德、家庭美德、个人品德教育，引导官兵争做“四有”新时代革命军人。按照走在前列的要求大抓精神文明建设，大力弘扬劳动精神、奋斗精神、奉献精神、创造精神、勤俭节约精神，带头传播真善美、传递正能量，不断激发官兵爱党忠诚、爱国奉献、爱军精武、爱岗敬业的热情。 （作者单位：武警第二机动总队某支队）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130001000/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269731.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231129115534/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269731.html,2023-11-30 0:00:00,Great Wall Outlook丨Strengthening Value Leadership and Providing Spiritual Support Source：China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author：Shen Bei Liang Yingzhong Editor-in-Chief：Sun Yue 2023-11-29 06:44:25 0,"The most important result of the National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology and Culture is the formal introduction and systematic elaboration of Xi Jinping's cultural ideology, which is a milestone in the history of the development of the Party's propaganda, ideology and culture. The conference also explicitly called for the widespread practice of socialist core values and the improvement and innovation of spiritual civilization construction work. We should comprehensively study and implement Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, deeply learn and understand President Xi's important exposition on cultivating and practicing socialist core values, further establish spiritual pillars, set up value benchmarks, and nurture newcomers of the times, so as to provide value leadership for Chinese-style modernization and spiritual support for the united struggle of the entire people. Core values carry the spiritual pursuit of a nation and a country, and embody the value standard of a society in judging what is right and wrong. The history of the development of human society shows that for a nation or a country, the most lasting and deepest strength is the core values recognized by the whole society. Without common core values, a nation or a country will have no place to go and no place to live. As President Xi said, ""Core values are an important stabilizer of a country, and whether or not we can build core values with a strong appeal is related to social harmony and stability, and the long-term stability of the country."" Socialist core values are rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture, fused with the great practice of the Party's leadership of the people's long-term struggle, and condensed with the common value pursuit of the entire people, which is a powerful force that unites people's hearts and minds and gathers the people's strength. President Xi has given important instructions on propaganda, ideological and cultural work in the form of ""seven efforts"", one of which is ""making efforts to cultivate and practice socialist core values"". On the new journey of building a strong nation and rejuvenating the nation, social ideologies and values are becoming increasingly diversified and diverse, requiring us to further play a leading role in socialist core values, further strengthen education, guidance, practice and institutional safeguards, and integrate socialist core values into the construction of the rule of law, into the development of society, and into daily life, so as to better build the Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese power. President Xi pointed out, ""When skyscrapers are erected all over our country, the edifice of the spirit of the Chinese nation should also stand tall."" Material civilization and spiritual civilization are the sum total and crystallization of all the achievements of human beings in understanding the world and transforming it. Without a solid and advanced material civilization, a country and nation will lack the material foundation to stand tall in the world. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the Central Committee of the CPC and President Xi have carried out the construction of spiritual civilization throughout the entire process of reform, opening up and modernization, and permeated all aspects of social life, launching comprehensive work on the construction of spiritual civilization, and making great achievements. Practice has proved that the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics can only move forward smoothly if the construction of both material and spiritual civilization is done well, the country's material and spiritual power is strengthened, and the material and spiritual life of people of all ethnic groups throughout the country is improved. One of the outstanding features of Chinese-style modernization is that it is a modernization that harmonizes material and spiritual civilization. A strong modernized socialist country built under the leadership of the CPC must be strong not only materially but also spiritually. This requires us to unify the development of material civilization with the progress of spiritual civilization in the historical process of promoting and expanding Chinese-style modernization, to promote the coordinated development of the ""two civilizations"" more firmly and consciously, and to continuously enhance the ideological, political and conscious principle of ""grasping with both hands, and doing hard work with both hands"" in the new situation. ""In the new situation, we will continue to enhance our ideological, political, and operational consciousness, and strive to promote the comprehensive enrichment of things and the comprehensive development of human beings. As a new type of people's army of proletarian nature, our army, from the day of its creation, has borne in mind the mandate of the Party and the people, insisted on ""what people to train and how to train them"" as the main content of its political work, and has guided its officers and soldiers to maintain at all times a distinct political stance, firm beliefs and convictions, a noble revolutionary spirit, and an excellent style and discipline. We are always in the forefront of practicing socialist core values and strengthening spiritual civilization. This has not only provided a strong ideological guarantee and an important source of strength for the development and growth of our army and its victory over the enemy, but has also had a great spiritual impact on the whole nation and made a significant contribution to the progress of social civilization. A man cannot stand without spirit, and a nation cannot be strong without spirit. This political and spiritual advantage has been molded into the winning advantage of the People's Army. ""All things are born when they have their origin, and all things are accomplished when they have their way."" Cultivating and practicing socialist core values is a basic project to condense the soul and strengthen the foundation. At all levels, we should adhere to the principle of cultivating people by virtue and educating people by culture, promote the normalization and institutionalization of education on ideals and beliefs, vigorously carry forward the spiritual genealogy of the Chinese Communists with the great founding spirit of the Party as the source, deepen the propaganda and education on socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Chinese dream of a strong army, and carry forward the national spirit with patriotism at its core, and the zeitgeist with reform and innovation at its core. In-depth publicity and education on core socialist values is being carried out, the core values of contemporary revolutionary soldiers are being cultivated on a lasting basis, and education on social morality, professional morality, family virtues and personal integrity is being carried out extensively to guide officers and soldiers to strive to be the ""four"" revolutionary soldiers of the new era. In accordance with the requirements of the forefront of the construction of spiritual civilization, vigorously carry forward the spirit of labor, the spirit of struggle, the spirit of dedication, the spirit of creativity, thrift and frugality, take the lead in the dissemination of truth, goodness, beauty and positive energy, and constantly stimulate the officers and soldiers to love the Party, loyalty and patriotic dedication, the love of the military, love of the enthusiasm of the job and dedication.

联合空中作战筹划要树立起与信息化作战相适应的新观念 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：鲍振峰 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-28 06:14:03 0,联合空中作战筹划要有新理念 ■鲍振峰 信息化联合空中作战筹划，是联合空中分域指挥员和指挥机关为达成上级战略意图或战役企图，完成联合空中作战任务，运用信息化筹划手段对联合空中作战行动进行科学决策、精确计划的思维和行动过程。应当看到，信息化联合空中作战筹划不是传统作战筹划与信息化筹划手段的简单叠加，而是信息化联合空中作战对作战筹划的内在要求。面向未来战争，联合空中作战筹划应突破传统思维方式的藩篱，树立起与信息化作战相适应的新观念。 全维时空观念。由于科技水平的制约，机械化战争中的空中作战一般局限于良好气象条件下的三维空间之中，空中作战指挥主要表现为交战双方在有限时间内的有形战场上进行激烈争夺和较量，此时的作战筹划难以摆脱时间和三维空间的束缚。在信息化战争大背景下，空中作战的实施空间由近及远、由平面向立体、由有形向无形延伸和拓展，呈现出全维一体的特征。战场由陆、海、空、天、电磁、网络等空间组成，并不断向新的维度延伸。同样，随着空中作战平台机动能力和武器系统夜视能力的大幅提升，空中作战受时间约束程度变小，全天候作战成为主流。这些变化成为空中作战筹划活动必须考虑的全新因素，要求联合空中分域指挥员及其指挥机关树立全维时空观念，依托指挥信息系统，运用先进的筹划方法，与对手在全维多域进行对抗和交锋。 全局网络观念。信息化战争时代，以网络为中心的作战理念已被世界各国接受和认同。网络化作战体系使空中作战模式由以平台为中心转变为以网络为中心，由以平台力量叠加谋求整体作战优势转变为以网络聚合作战力量谋求体系作战优势，为空中作战指挥提供了高效便捷的信息化手段，引发空中作战筹划和指挥控制模式的深刻变革。各级指挥机构组织实施信息化联合空中作战行动，需要充分利用指挥信息系统组织网络化作战筹划，即在情报信息共享的基础上，各级指挥机构根据统一的战场态势图，依托网络化指挥信息系统多级同步联合进行作战筹划，联合制定作战计划，对其进行推演、验证和评估，从而提高作战筹划效率。依托网络化作战体系组织实施信息化联合空中作战，应当通过科学、精确、快速的筹划，把信息优势转化为决策优势，进而再通过精打要害、破击体系，震慑敌军意志，削弱其整体作战能力，最终达成克敌制胜的目的。 全程稳定观念。未来战争，在基于网络化作战体系的对抗中，敌方将不断运用各种打击、干扰手段对我作战筹划活动进行破坏。指挥员及其指挥机关需要确保信息可靠、及时、持续传递，筹划活动有序、高效、持续展开，顺利完成各项筹划工作。信息化联合空中作战，其作战筹划大多情况下是基于网络的同步并行式筹划，筹划时效性更强，作战筹划是否稳定将对作战进程及其结局产生重要影响。可以说，在信息化联合空中作战中，保持筹划稳定比以往任何时期都更为重要。为此，需要做好以下几点：一要综合运用信息火力攻防手段，抗击敌人的侦察和打击，以确保指挥机构的安全；二要多手段多方法获取信息，灵活对抗信息干扰与进攻，快捷有序处理信息，确保指挥信息的准确；三要注重技术管理结合，采取积极防御方法，确保信息网络的正常运行；四要周密组织实施心战对抗，筑牢心理防线，确保指挥人员心理稳定、状态良好。 全向精准观念。信息化联合空中作战，攻防对抗激烈，态势瞬息万变，战机稍纵即逝，空中作战行动必须快速而精准，这对作战筹划提出了更高要求。精准的作战筹划，可以从智能化筹划和定量分析等方面来实现。具体来说，智能化筹划就是利用智能化筹划系统，快速准确地处理情报信息，评估联合空中作战参战力量的作战能力，辅助制定作战方案，论证评估优选作战方案，提供决策建议等等，旨在增强联合空中作战方案的可操作性，提高作战筹划的质量和效率。此外，根据军事运筹理论和先进的计算机算法建立空中各种行动的数学模型，不仅能够进行传统的兵力编成和任务分配计算，还可以对作战能力、作战效能、作战强度、作战心理等深层次的作战因素进行定量分析，大大增加作战筹划的准确性。借助智能化筹划系统的智力支持和定量计算的科学分析，作战筹划的精准性可以得到极大提升。 全新谋略观念。信息化战争，不仅没有削弱谋略在双方指挥对抗中的地位，反而由于信息化作战目的、作战样式、制胜机理等诸要素的变化，使得双方的谋略对抗呈现出新的变化。例如，由于信息化战场态势的动态透明，谋略对抗更加注重灵活性和时效性；由于信息技术的作用突出，谋划方法由群体谋划向人机合谋转变，等等。此外，随着大量信息化武器装备和技术手段的运用，指挥人员识谋、用谋的能力增强，谋略对抗的强度升级、难度增大。信息化战场上，基于网络的体系对抗需要依托网络来进行谋略对抗。为此，运用谋略首先应突出非线性思维和交互式思维，在此基础上对用谋对象进行全面分析，从全局把握敌作战体系与外部环境的关系，筹划全局性谋略。然后，对用谋对象进行要素分解，把握其中关键要素的特征，再进行系统还原，搞清楚用谋对象的全貌，继而有针对性地进行筹划。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130001000/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269580.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231128084801/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269580.html,2023-11-30 0:00:00,Joint Air Combat Planning to Establish New Concepts Compatible with Informatized Combat Source: china military net - liberation army newspaper Author: Bao Zhenfeng Editor-in-Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-28 06:14:03 0,"Joint air combat planning to have a new concept ■ Bao Zhenfeng informatization joint air combat planning, is a joint air sub-domain commanders and command authorities to achieve the superior strategic intent or campaign attempts to complete the joint air combat mission, the use of information technology planning means of joint air combat operations for scientific decision-making, precise planning thinking and action process.

Due to the constraints of the level of science and technology, mechanized war in the air combat is generally limited to good meteorological conditions in three-dimensional space, the air combat command is mainly manifested as the two sides in a limited period of time in the tangible battlefield to carry out fierce competition and contest, at this time it is difficult to get rid of the time of the combat planning and the three-dimensional space of the constraints. In the context of information war, the implementation of air combat space from near and far, from plane to three-dimensional, from tangible to intangible extension and expansion, showing the characteristics of the whole dimension. The battlefield consists of land, sea, air, sky, electromagnetic, network and other spaces, and constantly extends to new dimensions. Similarly, with the significant improvement of air combat platform mobility and weapon system night vision capability, air combat is less constrained by time, and all-weather combat has become the mainstream. These changes have become completely new factors that must be considered in air combat planning activities, requiring joint air sub-domain commanders and their command authorities to establish a full-dimensional space-time concept, relying on command information systems, the use of advanced planning methods, and the adversary in the full-dimensional multi-domain confrontation and engagement. Global network concept. In the era of information war, the network-centered combat concept has been accepted and recognized by countries around the world. Networked combat system makes the air combat mode from platform-centered to network-centered, from platform power superposition to seek overall combat advantages to network aggregation of combat power to seek system combat advantages, air combat command provides efficient and convenient means of information technology, triggering profound changes in air combat planning and command and control mode. Command institutions at all levels to organize and implement information-based joint air operations need to make full use of the command information system to organize networked operational planning, i.e., on the basis of intelligence and information sharing, command institutions at all levels will conduct joint operational planning based on a unified battlefield situation map, relying on a networked command information system to synchronize operational planning at multiple levels, jointly formulate operational plans, and carry out rehearsals, validation, and evaluation, thus improving the efficiency of operational planning. The efficiency of battle planning can be improved by jointly formulating battle plans and verifying and evaluating them. Relying on the networked combat system to organize and implement information-based joint air operations, through scientific, precise and rapid planning, the information advantage into a decision-making advantage, and then through the key points, breaking the system, deterring the enemy's will, weakening its overall combat capability, and ultimately achieve the purpose of defeating the enemy and winning the war. The concept of full stabilization. In the future war, in the confrontation based on networked combat system, the enemy will constantly use various strikes and interference means to sabotage my combat planning activities. Commanders and their command organs need to ensure that the information is reliable, timely, and continuously transmitted, and that the planning activities are orderly, efficient, and continuously carried out, so as to successfully complete the planning work. In the case of information-based joint air operations, most of the operational planning is network-based synchronized parallel planning, which is more time-sensitive, and whether the operational planning is stable or not will have an important impact on the operational process and its outcome. It can be said that in the informationized joint air operations, it is more important to maintain the stability of planning than in any previous period. To this end, the following points need to be done: First, comprehensive use of information firepower offensive and defensive means to resist enemy reconnaissance and strikes to ensure the safety of the command structure; second, multiple means and methods to obtain information, flexible confrontation of information jamming and attack, fast and orderly processing of information, to ensure the accuracy of the command information; third, we need to pay attention to the combination of technical management and take active defense methods to ensure the normal operation of the information network; fourth, we need to be carefully Organize the implementation of psychological warfare confrontation, build a firm psychological defense line, to ensure that the command staff psychological stability, good condition. Omni-directional precision concept. Informatization joint air combat, offensive and defensive confrontation is intense, the situation is changing rapidly, the war machine is fleeting, air combat operations must be fast and precise, which puts forward a higher demand for combat planning. Accurate combat planning can be realized from intelligent planning and quantitative analysis. Specifically, intelligent planning is the use of intelligent planning system, rapid and accurate processing of intelligence information, assessment of the combat capability of the joint air combat forces, assist in the development of combat programs, demonstration and evaluation of preferred combat programs, provide decision-making recommendations, etc., aiming to enhance the operability of the joint air combat program and improve the quality and efficiency of combat planning. In addition, according to military operations research theory and advanced computer algorithms to establish the mathematical model of various actions in the air, not only can carry out the traditional force formation and task allocation calculations, but also can carry out quantitative analysis of combat capability, combat effectiveness, combat intensity, combat psychology and other deep-level combat factors, greatly increasing the accuracy of combat planning. With the intellectual support of intelligent planning system and the scientific analysis of quantitative calculation, the accuracy of combat planning can be greatly enhanced. A new concept of strategy. Informatization war, not only did not weaken the position of strategy in the command confrontation between the two sides, but also due to the informatization of the purpose of combat, combat style, winning mechanism and other elements of the change, so that the two sides of the strategy confrontation presents new changes. For example, due to the dynamic transparency of the informationized battlefield situation, strategy confrontation pay more attention to the flexibility and timeliness; due to the prominent role of information technology, the planning method from the group planning to the transformation of man-machine conspiracy, and so on. In addition, with the use of a large number of informatized weapons and equipment and technical means, the commanding officer to know the strategy, the ability to use the strategy to enhance the intensity of the strategy confrontation escalation, increasing difficulty. On the informationized battlefield, network-based system confrontation needs to rely on the network to carry out strategic confrontation. For this reason, the use of strategy should first highlight the non-linear thinking and interactive thinking, on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the object of the strategy, from the overall grasp of the enemy combat system and the relationship between the external environment, planning the overall strategy. Then, the object of the strategy should be broken down into its elements, the characteristics of the key elements should be grasped, and then the system should be restored to make clear the whole picture of the object of the strategy, and then the strategy should be planned in a targeted manner.","Joint Air Combat Planning to Establish New Concepts Compatible with Informatized Combat. The article discusses the need for a new approach to air combat planning in the context of informationized warfare. This approach should include a global network concept, emphasizing the use of networked combat systems and information sharing among command institutions. The article also highlights the need for a full-dimensional space-time concept, recognizing that air combat is no longer limited to three-dimensional space and tangible battlefields. It also suggests that planning methods should rely on command information systems and advanced planning methods to effectively engage the adversary in multiple domains. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of maintaining stability in planning, using various means to resist enemy strikes and ensure the accuracy of command information. Finally, the article mentions the need for an omni-directional precision concept, suggesting that intelligent planning and quantitative analysis can significantly improve the accuracy of combat planning."

Joint culture is an important part of strong military culture, and it is a strategic hand that nourishes the joint combat system and enhances the joint combat capability. At present, our military joint combat system and mechanism has been established and increasingly perfect, there is an urgent need to step up the cultivation of joint culture to adapt to it, to educate people with culture, to culture people, with cultural ""soft power"" to promote the win ""hard power"" growth. Enhance the political consciousness of listening to the command in all actions Under the conditions of joint operations, the political factor will be more prominent, the forces involved in the war will be more diversified, and the joint operations will be more frequent, which requires that we must give full play to the political advantage of listening to the command of the Party, and ensure that at any time and in any situation, we always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Central Committee of the CPC, the Central Military Commission, and President Xi. Deepen the education on the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission. ""The power of the military is one, and military orders are one."" To comprehensively deepen the learning and education of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and to coordinate the education of the military soul and faith, especially in close connection with the historic achievements of the cause of strengthening the military since the 18th National Congress of the CPC and the historic changes that have taken place, to profoundly comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", to enhance the ""four consciousnesses"", to firmly establish the ""four consciousnesses"", and to strengthen the ""four consciousnesses"". To strengthen the ""four consciousnesses"", ""four self-confidence"" and ""two safeguards"", to implement the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission, and to always listen to the command of President Xi, be responsible to President Xi, and let President Xi rest assured. Strengthen the cultivation of global awareness. The forces of the various military branches in the joint operation are mixed and modularized according to the needs of the mission, and the strategic systematicity, relevance and wholeness are increasing. To deeply understand the Marxist military concept and methodology, the military guidance theory of our army and the inner mechanism of joint combat victory, to deeply grasp the individual elements of joint combat, local tactics on the system of combat, the battle of the whole situation of the key support, focusing on the realization of the President Xi and the Central Military Commission's strategic intent, regardless of what tasks are resolutely obey the orders, follow the command, to ensure that the overall overall overall advancement of the overall situation of the efficient coordination of the local. Strict discipline and rules. The battlefield environment of joint operations is more complex, and the war situation is changing rapidly, so it is more necessary to use iron discipline to gather iron will, refine iron style, and forge an iron team. To continue to carry out party spirit and discipline education and warning education, guide officers and soldiers to constantly strengthen a high degree of political awareness based on the concept of discipline and order consciousness, abide by the rules of discipline, and refine the order to prohibit the hard fighting style. Cultivation of unity and collaboration heavy joint thinking concept of modern warfare without war, without joint not win. As the pioneer of military practice, the joint culture of the most direct nourishment of the troops is to promote the values, thinking methods and behavioral norms to seek joint, want to joint, heavy joint change, and then to achieve close coordination between the combat troops, seamless, full coupling. Tree firmly the idea of joint. Joint combat organization and command complex, collaborative requirements are strict, a single mind can not command the war, a single military can not win the war. To consciously set off the ideological ""brainstorming"", efforts to remove the closed, linear, single, vertical integration of the traditional combat thinking, set up open, non-linear, the whole domain, horizontal integration of the joint operational thinking; remove the traditional mechanized warfare thinking and the limitations of the military branch, set up a joint winning, system construction, intensive and efficient, integrated development and other advanced Thinking concepts. Refining the skills of the United Front. The law of historical development of war tells us that to win integrated joint operations based on the network information system, we need to have a matching military literacy in information war. To this end, we need to increase the theoretical study of informationized warfare and informationized knowledge learning and training, focusing on the combat mission, focusing on the enemy situation and opponents, focusing on the future battlefield, through the joint coordination and command strategy training, major drills and training missions, research and innovation of war methods and training methods, guiding the troops to master the system of joint warfare, structure, style and laws of action, and to familiarize themselves with the main points of different forces in combat, the principles of application and the main performance of weapons and equipment, and to integrate into the system of joint warfare in an integrated way. Integrate into the joint combat system, and strive to use the battle method to strengthen the enemy a move, the odd calculation to win the enemy a chip. Strengthen the emotion of the United. In modern warfare, the institutional mechanism is a symptom, and emotional integration is fundamental. Our army in the initial stage of joint operations, we can fight the Battle of Hainan Island such a classic example of war, an important one is to participate in the long-term unity of the troops fighting together, the deep friendship under the common fight. To this end, we must focus on building values and mission concepts that are compatible with joint operations, give full play to the traditional advantages of the military forces with the same origin and roots, cultivate common emotions and values, common ideals and spirit, strengthen the collective psychological identity, and cohesion of the unbreakable will to win. The spirit of combat is the spirit of courage to fight and win. The cause and effect of the material is just the handle of the knife, the cause and effect of the spirit is the precious metal, is the real sharp blade. The joint culture belongs to the military culture, born in the joint operation, is essentially rich in combat elements, full of military flavor combat culture, its most distinctive trait is the spirit of combat. Under the conditions of joint operations, the enemy and I confrontation is more intense, more brutal fire kill, officers and soldiers face the test of life and death, psychological will more severe, more need to support the spirit of combat. Always think of the battle of bravado. The high fighting spirit, from the ""war is not far away"" sense of anxiety. Therefore, to strengthen the fundamental functions of the military education, clear when the soldiers to fight, lead the troops to fight, training and fighting is the main responsibility is also the main job, clear troops to bear the task of war preparation, shoulder war preparation requirements, and constantly strengthen the troops to prepare for war duty and mission; strengthen the situation of war preparedness education, and constantly strengthen the bow of the enemy's awareness of the pre-firing; tamping down the overall concept of national security education, and clear the hostile forces of public opinion on me to discredit the network attacks and other adverse effects, to guide the officers and men to further stimulate the war. The company's goal is to guide the officers and soldiers to further stimulate the motivation to fight. Inspire the courage to fight. In-depth education on the Marxist concept of war and the concept of life and death of revolutionary soldiers has been carried out, guiding officers and soldiers to deeply understand the martyrs' spirit of living to the death and sacrificing their lives to ensure that they can come out and stand up at critical times. In-depth promotion of the glorious traditions of the people's army and advanced models, combat heroes typical deeds, focus on shaping the war is happy, brave and tenacious, the will to sacrifice character and dare to fight will win the martial spirit. Hammering the bottom of the battle. To be able to win the war, we must set up the actual combat standard to pay close attention to the preparation and training. First of all, the battlefield environment to build close to the actual combat, highlighting the extreme environment of the field, the actual fight under the conditions of continuous operation, so that the officers and men in training smell the smoke of the battlefield, to strengthen the battlefield experience, refining ""not afraid of tiredness"" of the strong body and ""pressure not collapse"" of the strong psychological. Secondly, the situation should be set up to closely follow the actual combat, highlighting the setting of the dangerous situation, the dangerous situation, the difficult situation, cloth handicap, the opponent to set up a strong, the situation to set up a difficult, difficult to set up enough, so that the troops in the overwhelmed, ""suffer"" to practice style, and in the constant failure of frustration in the ""planted heel""! Strong will, forging and casting changes, not afraid of danger, indomitable strong will. Again, the assessment standard requirements to closely follow the actual combat, urging officers and men to jointly practice this ability, skills to the extreme, thus improving the dare to fight confidence, strengthen the belief in the war. Constructing a system pattern of mutual integration and borrowing to promote the joint culture grows in the military culture, but not a simple splicing of the military culture, but from the military culture to draw the essence of the superiority of the two are compatible symbiosis, mutual promotion. Therefore, the construction of joint culture is a systematic project to promote the culture of each military branch, integrate and upgrade, and we should not only adhere to the goal and direction of the joint culture, but also focus on providing nourishment for the joint culture. Twist the leader of the top-level integrated design. The joint culture will be reflected through the joint institutional mechanism, and the joint institutional mechanism will in turn promote the improvement of the joint culture. At present, the awareness and concept of joint has been gradually integrated into the practice of troop construction, should closely follow the dynamic adjustment of the institutional establishment to promote the innovation and development of the joint cultural mechanism, and strengthen the overall design and intensive planning for the development of the culture of troops at all levels and of all types. Party committees at all levels should regularly analyze the situation of joint cultural cultivation, combine joint training monitoring and combat effectiveness assessment to find weak links, study improvement measures, and resolve various contradictions and problems in construction in an integrated manner. Grass-roots troops should summarize and feedback the effectiveness of their work in a timely manner to ensure that the construction of a joint culture is standardized and implemented on a regular basis. Twisting the key to the cultural integration of the military services. The joint culture cannot be without the support of the military culture, and the military culture cannot be separated from the integration of the joint culture. Our military practice in the formation of a distinctive military culture, the deeper the roots of the military characteristics of the culture, the more vitality of the joint culture. To this end, to highlight the ""joint"" theme, guide the military culture in maintaining their unique traditions on the basis of efforts to cultivate the political soul of the party command, the value of joint victory concept and information-led military literacy, to create a cultural brand in line with the joint requirements. It is necessary to systematically sort out the glorious traditions and unique spirit of each military service, promote its integration into the joint culture, and comprehensively enhance the recognition and consensus of the joint culture of the various forces, so as to provide rich nourishment and vitality for the construction of the joint culture. The fundamental aspect of training talents for joint operations is that they are the key to commanding the war. Joint combat talents are the backbone of commanding the war and building up the army, and the nourishment of joint culture should be integrated into the whole process of talent training. On the one hand, to use a good ""three-in-one"" new military personnel training system, integration of troops, colleges and universities, local and other elements of multi-channel power, increase exchanges and cooperation, and build a joint culture embedded in the new mode of personnel training system. On the other hand, we should grasp the post practice exercise, through the military cross-posting, participate in joint combat exercises, complete major tasks, respond to emergencies, etc., the spirit of the ""United"" kernel into the practice of joint combat in all areas of the whole process, to ensure that preparation for training by the ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"", ""United"" and ""United"". This ensures that the preparation and training are born from the ""United"", take the ""United"" as the key, and make efforts towards the ""United"". (Author's unit: School of Joint Operations, National Defense University)","The article highlights the importance of strengthening the construction of joint warfare culture in the new era. Joint culture is an essential part of strong military culture, and it is a strategic hand that nourishes the joint combat system and enhances the joint combat capability. The political consciousness of listening to the command is crucial in joint operations, and the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission needs to be deepened. Additionally, the importance of cultivating global awareness and strict discipline and rules is emphasized. The spirit of the ""United"" is crucial in modern warfare, and the joint culture should be integrated into the joint combat system to strengthen the enemy and win the war. Finally, the article emphasizes the need to promote joint culture, focus on training military personnel for joint operations, and integrate the various branches of the military to strengthen the joint culture."
在文化自信自强中凝聚精神力量 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：徐建飞 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-27 06:51:58 0,在文化自信自强中凝聚精神力量 ■徐建飞 在文化传承发展座谈会上，习近平总书记提出了“建设中华民族现代文明”这一恢宏时代主题，强调要“坚定文化自信、担当使命、奋发有为，共同努力创造属于我们这个时代的新文化，建设中华民族现代文明”。建设中华民族现代文明，是社会主义精神文明建设的重要内容，是赓续中华民族历史文脉的必由之路，也是实现中华民族伟大复兴的必然要求。习近平总书记从党和国家事业发展全局战略高度，对中华文化传承发展的一系列重大理论和现实问题作了全面系统深入阐述，为我们更好担负起新时代新的文化使命，扎实推进中华民族现代文明和社会主义文化强国建设，指明了前进方向、提供了根本遵循。 中华文明是世界上唯一绵延不断且以国家形态发展至今的伟大文明。回望历史，在5000多年的中华文明中涌现出了老子、孔子、屈原等灿若星辰的历史人物，诞生了诗经、楚辞、汉赋、唐诗、宋词等浩如烟海的文学经典，为中华民族提供了丰厚精神滋养。中华优秀传统文化是中华文明的智慧结晶和精华所在，镌刻着中华民族精忠爱国、刚健有为、自强不息、革故鼎新等民族品格，承载着中华民族共有的历史文化记忆与思想价值认同，其内蕴的思辨哲学、价值追求、德行践履、人文品格等精神特质，凝铸成中华民族独特的文化基因。同时，中华优秀传统文化中蕴含的天下为公、民为邦本、为政以德、革故鼎新、任人唯贤、天人合一、自强不息、厚德载物、讲信修睦、亲仁善邻等，是中国人民在长期生产生活中积累的宇宙观、天下观、社会观、道德观的重要体现，同科学社会主义价值观主张具有高度契合性，也是推进马克思主义中国化时代化的丰厚文化沃土。建设中华民族现代文明，必须要加强对中华优秀传统文化的保护传承和创新发展，深入挖掘其蕴含的思想观念、人文精神、道德规范，把中华优秀传统文化的精神标识提炼出来、展示出来，把中华优秀传统文化中具有当代价值、世界意义的文化精髓提炼出来、展示出来。要坚持以马克思主义为指导，对中华5000多年文明宝库进行全面挖掘，用马克思主义激活中华优秀传统文化中富有生命力的优秀因子并赋予新的时代内涵，把马克思主义思想精髓同中华优秀传统文化精华贯通起来、同人民群众日用而不觉的共同价值观念融通起来，把中华民族的伟大精神和丰富智慧更深层次地注入马克思主义，让中华文明展现出时代风采和永久魅力。 文化建设是培根铸魂、凝神聚力的重要事业。繁荣发展文化事业和文化产业，有助于发展社会主义文化，更好满足人民群众对精神文化的需求；有助于培育和弘扬社会主义核心价值观，增强实现中华民族伟大复兴的精神力量；有助于推动中华民族现代文明建设，提升国家文化软实力和中华文化影响力。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央高度重视文化工作，作出一系列重大决策部署，推出一系列重大政策举措，推动中国特色社会主义文化繁荣发展。在看到文化建设取得重大成就的同时，我们也要清醒认识到，文化引领风尚、教育人民、服务社会、推动发展的作用还未充分发挥；文化创新创造能力还不够强，高质量文化产品和文化服务还不够多；我国文化话语权与综合国力和国际地位还不相匹配，维护国家文化安全和提升中华文化影响力任重而道远。习近平总书记在对宣传思想文化工作作出的重要指示中，明确提出“七个着力”，其中之一是“着力推动文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展”。在推动文化事业和文化产业繁荣发展过程中，一方面我们要把握好意识形态属性和产业属性、社会效益和经济效益的关系，坚持社会主义先进文化前进方向，把社会效益放在首位，推动基本公共文化服务标准化、均等化，坚持政府主导、社会参与、重心下移、共建共享，完善公共文化服务体系，提高基本公共文化服务的覆盖面和适用性，切实保障人民群众基本文化权益。另一方面，大力推进文化领域供给侧结构性改革，健全现代文化产业体系和市场体系，推动各类文化市场主体发展壮大。要顺应数字产业化和产业数字化发展趋势，推动文化产业与互联网、大数据、人工智能等融合发展，培育新型文化业态和文化消费模式，增强文化整体实力和竞争力，努力推动文化事业全面繁荣、文化产业快速发展。 坚定文化自信自强，是事关国运兴衰、事关文化安全、事关民族精神独立性的大问题。我们坚定的道路自信、理论自信、制度自信，其本质正是建立在5000多年文明传承基础上的文化自信。当前，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开，各种传统和非传统安全威胁交织叠加，需要应对的风险和挑战、需要解决的矛盾和问题比以往更加错综复杂。在新的历史起点上继续推动文化繁荣、建设文化强国、建设中华民族现代文明，必须坚定文化自信，坚持走自己的路，立足中华民族伟大历史实践和当代实践，用中国道理总结好中国经验，把中国经验提升为中国理论，实现精神上的独立自主。新征程上，推进文化自信自强，必须坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义文化发展道路，发展面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来的，民族的科学的大众的社会主义文化，推动社会主义物质文明和精神文明协调发展。不论过去、现在和将来，我们都要把国家和民族发展放在自己力量的基点上，持续强化民族自尊心和自信心，弘扬以爱国主义为核心的民族精神和以改革创新为核心的时代精神，不断深化文化体制机制改革创新，激发全民族文化创新创造活力，满足人民文化需求、丰富人民精神世界，凝聚实现中华民族伟大复兴的精神力量。 （作者单位：扬州大学马克思主义学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130001000/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269394.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127182841/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269394.html,2023-11-30 0:00:00,Gathering Spiritual Strength in Cultural Self-confidence and Self-strengthening Source: china military net - liberation army daily Author: Xu Jianfei Editor-in-chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-27 06:51:58 0,"In the cultural self-confidence and self-improvement in the spirit of cohesion ■ Xu Jianfei in the cultural heritage development symposium, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the grand theme of the times ""building a modern civilization of the Chinese nation,"" emphasized the need to ""firm cultural self-confidence, to take up the mission, and strive to work hard, and work together to create a new culture of our time, building a modern civilization of the Chinese nation"". We should work together to create a new culture for our time and build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation. Building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation is an important part of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, a necessary way to continue the historical lineage of the Chinese nation, and an inevitable requirement for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a comprehensive, systematic and in-depth elaboration of a series of major theoretical and practical issues on the development of Chinese cultural heritage from the strategic height of the overall development of the Party and the country, which has pointed out the way forward and provided a fundamental guideline for us to better shoulder the new cultural mission in the new era, and to solidly push forward the construction of modern civilization of the Chinese nation and the construction of a strong socialist cultural country. Chinese civilization is the only great civilization in the world that has continued to develop in the form of a nation. Looking back at history, Chinese civilization of more than 5,000 years has produced star-studded historical figures such as Laozi, Confucius and Qu Yuan, as well as literary classics such as the Classic of Poetry, Chu Rhetoric, Han Fugue, Tang Poetry and Song Lyrics, which have provided the Chinese nation with rich spiritual nourishment. Excellent traditional Chinese culture is the crystallization of the wisdom and essence of Chinese civilization, engraved with the national character of the Chinese people, such as loyalty and patriotism, robustness, self-improvement and innovation, carrying the historical and cultural memories and ideological and value identities shared by the Chinese people, and its embedded philosophies of thought and discernment, pursuit of values, virtues, humanistic character and other spiritual traits, which have been cast into the unique cultural genes of the Chinese people. At the same time, the concepts of ""the world is for the public"", ""the people are the foundation of the state"", ""governance is based on morality"", ""reforming the old and introducing the new"", ""meritocracy"", ""unity of heaven and mankind"", ""self-improvement"", ""virtue"", ""preaching faith and cultivation of harmony"", ""being kind to one's neighbor"" and so on, embedded in the excellent traditional Chinese culture, are the important embodiment of the concepts of the universe, the world, the community and the morals that have accumulated by the Chinese people during the long period of their productive life. It is also a fertile cultural ground for promoting the modernization of Marxism. To build the modern civilization of the Chinese nation, it is necessary to strengthen the protection, inheritance and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, deeply excavate the ideological concepts, humanistic spirit and ethical norms it contains, and distill and display the spiritual markers of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and distill and display the cultural essence of the excellent traditional Chinese culture that is of contemporary value and world significance. We should adhere to the guidance of Marxism, conduct a comprehensive excavation of the treasure trove of China's 5,000 years of civilization, use Marxism to activate the vitality of the outstanding factors of Chinese fine traditional culture and give them new connotations for the times, integrate the essence of Marxist thought with the essence of Chinese fine traditional culture, and with the common values that the people have used every day without realizing it, so as to infuse the great spirit and rich wisdom of the Chinese nation more deeply into the Chinese culture and to make the Chinese people more aware of the importance of the Chinese culture. Inject the great spirit and rich wisdom of the Chinese nation into Marxism at a deeper level, so that Chinese civilization can display the elegance and permanent charm of the times. Cultural construction is an important undertaking to cultivate the roots and soul and to concentrate the spirit and energy of the people. Prospering and developing cultural undertakings and cultural industries will help develop socialist culture and better satisfy the people's demand for spiritual culture; help cultivate and carry forward socialist core values and enhance the spiritual strength for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; and help promote the construction of a modern civilization for the Chinese nation and enhance the country's cultural soft power and the influence of Chinese culture. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has attached great importance to cultural work, made a series of major decisions and deployments, and launched a series of major policies and initiatives to promote the prosperity and development of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. While seeing the significant achievements in cultural construction, we also need to be soberly aware that the role of culture in leading customs, educating the people, serving the society and promoting development has not yet been given full play; the capacity for cultural innovation and creativity is still not strong enough, and there are not enough high-quality cultural products and services; China's cultural discourse does not yet match its comprehensive national strength and international status, and safeguarding national cultural security and enhancing the influence of Chinese culture is a heavy task and has a long way to go. Maintaining national cultural security and enhancing China's cultural influence is a heavy task and a long way to go. General Secretary Xi Jinping, in his important instructions on propaganda, ideology and cultural work, explicitly put forward ""seven efforts"", one of which is to ""strive to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings and cultural industries"". In promoting the prosperous development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries, on the one hand, we have to grasp the relationship between ideological attributes and industrial attributes, social benefits and economic benefits, adhere to the direction of advanced socialist culture, put social benefits in the first place, promote the standardization and equalization of basic public cultural services, adhere to the government's leading role, social participation, the center of gravity downward, and the common sharing, and improve the public cultural service system, improve the coverage of basic public cultural services, and increase the coverage of public cultural services. Improve the coverage and applicability of basic public cultural services, and effectively safeguard the basic cultural rights and interests of the people. On the other hand, vigorously promote the supply-side structural reform in the field of culture, improve the modern cultural industry system and market system, and promote the development and growth of all kinds of cultural market players. It is necessary to comply with the development trend of digital industrialization and industrial digitization, promote the integration and development of the cultural industry with the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, etc., cultivate new cultural forms and cultural consumption patterns, enhance the overall strength and competitiveness of culture, and strive to promote the overall prosperity of the cultural undertakings and the rapid development of the cultural industry. Firm cultural self-confidence and self-improvement is a major issue related to the rise and fall of the nation, cultural security, and the spiritual independence of the nation. Our firm road confidence, theoretical self-confidence, institutional self-confidence, the essence of which is precisely the cultural self-confidence based on the inheritance of more than 5,000 years of civilization. At present, the changes in the world, the times and history are unfolding in an unprecedented manner, with various traditional and non-traditional security threats intertwined and overlapping, and the risks and challenges to be dealt with as well as the contradictions and problems to be solved are more intricate and complex than ever before. To continue to promote cultural prosperity, build a strong cultural country, and build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation from a new historical starting point, we must be firm in our cultural self-confidence, adhere to our own path, base ourselves on the great historical practice of the Chinese nation and contemporary practice, summarize the Chinese experience with Chinese reasoning, and elevate the Chinese experience to a Chinese theory, so as to realize our spiritual independence. On the new journey, to promote cultural self-confidence and self-reliance, we must adhere to Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our guide, unswervingly follow the road of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, develop a modernized, world-facing, and future-oriented, nationalistic, scientific, and popular socialist culture, and promote the coordinated development of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization. Regardless of the past, present and future, we must place the development of the country and the nation at the base of our strength, continue to strengthen national pride and self-confidence, carry forward the national spirit with patriotism at its core and the spirit of the times with reform and innovation at its core, deepen the reforms and innovations of the cultural system and mechanisms, stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation, satisfy the people's cultural needs, enrich the people's spiritual world, and unite the spiritual forces for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The spirit of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be strengthened.

思想战线丨一体推进战、建、备高质量发展 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：马永生 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-27 06:49:22 0,一体推进战建备高质量发展 ■马永生 坚持边斗争、边备战、边建设，是习近平强军思想的重要内涵，是“十四五”乃至今后一个较长时期我军的突出特点。面对这一新的目标任务和形势要求，我们必须坚持以战领建，强化战建统筹，做好军事斗争准备，进一步突出战的牵引、提升建的效能、强化备的支撑，形成战、建、备一体推进的良好局面。 把握时代要求，在以战领建上立起新标高 一切为了打仗、一切为了胜利，是贯穿我军建设发展的鲜明主线。回顾我军90多年的发展历程，能打仗、打胜仗是一以贯之的目标追求。进入新时代，我军建设面临一系列新形势新情况新任务，迫切需要从更宽视野、更深层次立牢以战领建这个“指挥棒”，充分发挥作战需求对建设规划的牵引作用。 战争风险增大形势所迫。随着世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，我国安全形势不稳定性不确定性增大。我军要在风云变幻的严峻考验面前履行好新时代使命任务，必须认清战争风险，增强忧患意识，牢记我军首先是一个战斗队，是为打仗而存在的，确保一旦有事拉得出、上得去、打得赢。 军事科技革命发展所指。当前，新一轮科技革命和军事革命正在加速发展，一系列前沿性颠覆性战略性技术广泛应用于军事领域，混合战争、代理人战争有新的发展，无人作战、认知攻防等新的作战方式层出不穷，正从全局上深刻改变战争面貌。唯有紧盯科技之变、战争之变、对手之变，坚持自主创新战略基点，加快突破关键核心技术，发展战略性、前沿性、颠覆性技术，实施国防科技和武器装备重大工程，提升我军打赢信息化智能化战争能力，才能牢牢把握军事竞争主动权。 强军战略安排使命所系。国防和军队现代化新“三步走”战略安排，是新时代强军事业的蓝图擘画。实现建军一百年奋斗目标，确保掌握捍卫国家主权、安全、发展利益的战略主动，重中之重就是加快形成同国家战略需求相适应的军事能力。要实现这一重大历史使命，必须从全局和长远上推进我军实战能力建设，把工作重心归正到备战打仗上来，加快锻造更强大的能力、更可靠的手段。 战争筹划设计现实所需。近年来，在新时代军事战略方针指引下，我军积极加强核心作战概念开发，着力把打什么仗、怎么打仗搞清楚，在战争和作战问题研究上取得了重要进展和成效。但同强敌对手相比，在构建先进作战理论体系、创新战法训法等方面，还有不小差距。创新提高战争筹划和指导水平，深入研究现代战争制胜机理，加速提升一体化联合作战能力，是我们必须回答好的时代课题。 强化战略支撑，在抓建为战上务求新成效 党的十八大以来，抓备战、谋打赢奏响了强军兴军的时代强音，全部心思向打仗聚焦、全部工作向打仗用劲，成为全军普遍共识和行动。我们要始终瞄准强军胜战这个基点，让生成和提高战斗力的要素充分涌现，推动各项工作更好服务战斗力建设。 加强军队党的建设。组织强则军队强。革命战争年代，红军之所以艰苦奋战而不溃散，支部建在连上是一个重要原因。组织力就是战斗力，把党组织锻造成坚强战斗堡垒，就能够把党的政治优势和组织优势转化为制胜优势。在新形势下推进军队党的建设，着力重点就是要把战斗力标准贯彻到军队党的建设各个方面，推动形成有利于加强练兵备战的工作导向、用人导向、政策导向、舆论导向，在务打赢、谋创新、抓人才、励军心上取得实实在在成效。 建强军事力量体系。人才是战争胜负的决定性因素。全面提升我军备战打仗能力，最艰巨的是人才准备。近年来，通过推进军队规模结构和力量编成改革，实现了我军革命性锻造、整体性重塑，在军事人员现代化上向前迈进了一大步，达到了强筋壮骨、消肿瘦身的目的。随着战争形态和作战方式的深度演进，加快构建以新域新质为增长极、以精锐作战力量为主体的联合作战力量体系是大势所趋，必须在这方面重点突破、整体推进。 完善军事政策制度。当今世界，大国军事竞争很重要的一个方面就体现在军事政策制度上，必须把制度建设摆在战略位置紧抓不放。经过军事政策制度改革，我军逐步建立健全基于联合、平战一体的军事力量运用政策制度体系，建立健全聚焦打仗、激励创新、军民融合的军事力量建设政策制度体系，建立健全精准高效、全面规范、刚性约束的军事管理政策制度体系以及国防科技创新和武器装备建设制度。我们要不断巩固深化军事政策制度改革成果，在聚焦备战、激励创新、刚性约束等方面持续用力，为部队战斗力建设保驾护航。 提升军事治理效能。管理粗放是长期制约我军建设发展的一个突出问题。党的二十大作出了全面加强军事治理的战略部署，核心指向就是拓宽视野、更新理念，着力构建现代军事治理体系、提高现代军事治理能力，以高水平治理支撑备战打仗高质量发展。我们要以巩固提高一体化国家战略体系和能力为推动，促进军事治理与国家治理有机衔接、密切协同，促进军地各领域各层级相互促进、相互协同，加快信息、技术、人才、设施等要素双向流动和高效配置，最大程度实现功能结构耦合联动。 练强斗争本领，在备战打仗上展现新作为 新时代强军事业是在斗争中开创和前进的。新征程上，我们还有不少“娄山关”“腊子口”需要攻克，必须充分做好应对各种复杂困难局面的准备，练强敢打必胜的真功夫硬功夫。 加强战略威慑“塑势”。军队的战略功能之一就是塑造态势、管控危机，用强大的军事实力震慑敌人、以武止戈。近代中国发展屡屡被外敌阻滞，孱弱的军事力量总是最先倒下的那块“多米诺骨牌”。习主席通过对古今中外战争与和平规律的总结，特别是透过近代以来我国遭受列强战争蹂躏的历史教训，深刻指出：“能战方能止战，准备打才可能不必打，越不能打越可能挨打，这就是战争与和平的辩证法。”新的时代条件下，我们要始终坚持以习近平强军思想为指导，厚植以能击不能的战略优势，对可能发生的战争风险始终保持战略清醒，随时准备打仗，立足现有条件打仗，不打无准备无把握之仗，有力慑止战争，使对手不敢轻启战端。 坚持军事斗争“制衡”。当前，面对逆风逆水的外部环境挑战，国家安全压力上升，军事斗争任务越来越重。我们必须坚持斗争原则的坚定性与策略的灵活性相统一，在原则问题上寸土不让，做到针锋相对、寸土必争；在策略问题上灵活机动，讲求斗争的方式方法和艺术。实践证明，斗争形势越复杂，越要有策略、有步骤地用好军事这一手，在军事行动同政治外交行动协调配合中，形成斗争整体合力。 运用底线思维“稳局”。我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，各种“黑天鹅”“灰犀牛”事件随时可能发生。这就要求我们必须坚持底线思维、极限思维，做到准确识变、科学应变、主动求变，沉着应对各种风险挑战，努力在危机中育先机、于变局中开新局。只有以“一失万无”的心态做“万无一失”的准备，把困难估计得更充分一些，把风险思考得更深入一些，下好先手棋、打好主动仗，才能在控危局、制险局、保大局上牢牢守住底线。 （作者单位：湖南省军区）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130001000/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269393.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127190951/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269393.html,2023-11-30 0:00:00,"Ideological Front丨integrated to promote the high-quality development of war, construction and preparation Source: china military net - liberation army newspaper Author: Ma Yongsheng Editor in Chief: Yixi Ram 2023-11-27 06:49:22 0","The one to promote the high-quality development of war construction and preparation ■ Ma Yongsheng Adhering to the struggle, preparation and construction is an important connotation of Xi Jinping's idea of strengthening the military, is the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" and even a longer period of time in the future of the outstanding characteristics of our military. In the face of this new goal and task and the requirements of the situation, we must adhere to the war to lead the construction, strengthen the war and construction of the integration of the military struggle to do a good job of preparation, further highlighting the traction of the war, to enhance the effectiveness of the construction, strengthen the support for the preparation of the formation of the war, the construction of the preparation of the integration of the promotion of a good situation. Grasp the requirements of the times, and set up a new elevation on the war-led construction All for the sake of war, all for the sake of victory, is the distinctive main line running through the development of our military construction. Looking back at the development of our army over the past 90 years, the goal of being able to fight and win battles has always been pursued. Entering the new era, our military construction is facing a series of new situations and new tasks, and there is an urgent need to establish the ""baton"" from a wider perspective and at a deeper level, and to give full play to the pulling effect of operational needs on construction planning. The situation of increasing war risk is compelling. With the accelerated evolution of the world's unprecedented changes, the instability and uncertainty of China's security situation has increased. Our army to fulfill the mission and task of the new era in front of the severe test of the storm clouds and changes, we must recognize the risk of war, enhance the sense of anxiety, bearing in mind that our army is first of all a combat team, is for the war and the existence of, to ensure that once there is something to pull out, on the go, to fight and win. The development of military science and technology revolution refers to. At present, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and military revolution is accelerating the development of a series of cutting-edge subversive strategic technology widely used in the military field, hybrid warfare, proxy wars have new developments, unmanned combat, cognitive attack and defense and other new ways of warfare emerge in an endless stream, from the overall situation profoundly change the face of the war. The only way to firmly grasp the initiative of military competition is to keep a close eye on the changes in science and technology, the changes in war, and the changes in opponents, adhere to the strategic base of independent innovation, accelerate the breakthroughs in key core technologies, develop strategic, cutting-edge, and subversive technologies, carry out major projects in national defense science and technology as well as in armaments and equipment, and enhance the ability of the military to win the information-intelligent war. Strong military strategic arrangement mission. The new ""three-step"" strategic arrangement for the modernization of national defense and the military is a blueprint for the cause of strengthening the military in the new era. To realize the goal of building the army for 100 years, and to ensure the strategic initiative of defending national sovereignty, security and development interests, the most important thing is to accelerate the formation of military capabilities that are in line with the country's strategic needs. To realize this major historical mission, it is necessary to promote the construction of our military's actual combat capability in the overall situation and in the long run, to focus on preparing for war, and to accelerate the forging of more powerful capabilities and more reliable means. War planning and design is required by reality. In recent years, under the guidance of the military strategic policy of the new era, our army has actively strengthened the development of core operational concepts, focusing on what kind of war to fight and how to fight to make it clear, and has made important progress and results in the study of war and operational issues. However, compared with our strongest rivals, there is still a considerable gap between us in terms of building an advanced combat theory system and innovating combat methods and training methods. Innovation to improve the level of war planning and guidance, in-depth study of the mechanism of victory in modern war, accelerate the enhancement of integrated joint combat capabilities, is the subject of the times we must answer. Strengthen the strategic support, in grasping the construction for the war to seek new results since the 18th CPC National Congress, grasping the preparation for war, seeking to win played the strong sound of the era of the army, all the mind to the war focus, all the work to the war effort, the army has become a general consensus and action. We should always aim at the base of the strong army to win the war, so that the elements of generating and improving combat effectiveness fully emerge, and promote the work to better serve the construction of combat effectiveness. Strengthen the construction of the army party. A strong organization is a strong army. In the revolutionary war era, the reason why the Red Army fought hard and did not break up, the branch built on the company is an important reason. Organizational strength is combat effectiveness, the party organization forged into a strong fighting fortress, the party's political and organizational advantages can be transformed into a winning advantage. In the new situation to promote the construction of the army party, the focus is to carry out the combat effectiveness standard to all aspects of the construction of the army party, and promote the formation of work orientation, employment orientation, policy orientation, public opinion orientation conducive to strengthening the training and preparation for war, in the service to win, seek innovation, grasp the talent, motivation of the military to achieve tangible results. Build a strong military force system. Talent is the decisive factor in winning or losing a war. Comprehensively enhance the ability of our army to prepare for war, the most arduous is the preparation of talents. In recent years, by pushing forward the reform of the size and structure of the army and the formation of forces, we have achieved a revolutionary forging and overall reshaping of the army, and have taken a big step forward in the modernization of military personnel, achieving the purpose of strengthening the muscles and bones and reducing swelling and thinning the body. With the in-depth evolution of war forms and combat modes, accelerating the construction of a joint combat force system with new domains and new qualities as growth poles and elite combat forces as the main body is a general trend, and it is necessary to make key breakthroughs in this area and promote it as a whole. Improve the military policy system. In today's world, a very important aspect of military competition among major powers is reflected in the military policy system, which must be placed in a strategic position to grasp the construction of the system. After the reform of the military policy system, our military has gradually established and improved the policy and system of military force utilization based on jointness and the integration of peace and war, established and improved the policy and system of military force construction focusing on war fighting, stimulating innovation, and integrating the military with the people, and established and improved the precise and efficient, comprehensive and standardized, and rigidly constrained policy and system of military management, as well as the system of national defense science and technology innovation and weapons and equipment construction. We must continuously consolidate and deepen the results of the reform of the military policy system, and continue to exert efforts in focusing on war preparation, incentivizing innovation, and rigidly restraining, so as to escort the construction of combat power for the troops. Enhance the effectiveness of military governance. Sloppy management is a prominent problem that has long constrained the development of our military construction. The 20th CPC National Congress made a strategic plan to comprehensively strengthen military governance, the core point is to broaden the vision, update the concept, focus on building a modern military governance system, improve modern military governance capabilities, and support the preparation for war with a high level of governance and high quality development. We need to consolidate and improve the integrated national strategic system and capabilities as a drive to promote the organic convergence and close synergy between military governance and national governance, to promote mutual promotion and synergy between various fields and levels in the military and the field, to accelerate the two-way flow of information, technology, talent, facilities and other elements and efficient allocation, to maximize the realization of the functional structure of the coupling and linkage. Practicing strong struggle skills, in the preparation for war and war to show a new role in the new era of strong military cause is in the struggle to create and move forward. On the new journey, we still have a lot of ""Loushan Pass"" ""Lazikou"" need to be overcome, we must be fully prepared to deal with a variety of complex and difficult situations, and practicing strong dare to fight and win the real hard work. Strengthening strategic deterrence ""molding"". One of the strategic functions of the military is to shape the posture, crisis management, with a strong military power to deter the enemy, to stop the war. Modern China's development has been repeatedly blocked by foreign enemies, weak military force is always the first to fall that ""dominoes"". President Xi summarized the laws of war and peace in ancient and modern times and at home, especially through the history of modern China suffered from the war ravages of the great powers, profoundly pointed out that: ""the war can stop the war, ready to fight may not have to fight, the more you can not fight, the more likely to be beaten, this is the dialectics of war and peace."" Under the conditions of the new era, we should always adhere to Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military as a guide, planting a strategic advantage of being able to fight against being unable to do so, maintaining strategic clarity on the possible risks of war, being ready to fight at any time, fighting on the basis of the existing conditions, and not fighting unprepared and unsure battles, so as to effectively deter wars, so that the opponents do not dare to start the war lightly. Adhere to the military struggle ""checks and balances"". At present, in the face of the challenges of the external environment against the wind and water, the national security pressure is rising, the military struggle task is getting heavier and heavier. We must adhere to the unity of the principle of the struggle and the flexibility of the strategy, in the principle of the issue of not yielding an inch, so that the tit for tat, inch for inch; in the strategy of the issue of flexibility, seeking ways and means and the art of the struggle. Practice has proved that the more complex the struggle situation, the more strategic and systematic use of the military hand, in the military action and political and diplomatic action to coordinate and cooperate, to form the overall synergy of the struggle. Use bottom-line thinking to stabilize the situation. China's development has entered a period where strategic opportunities and risks and challenges coexist, and uncertainties and unpredictable factors increase, and various ""black swans"" and ""gray rhinoceros"" events may occur at any time. This requires us to adhere to the bottom line thinking, limit thinking, to accurately identify changes, scientific response to changes, take the initiative to seek changes, calmly respond to various risks and challenges, and strive to cultivate the first opportunity in the crisis, and to open a new situation in the changing situation. Only with the ""one failure"" mentality to do ""foolproof"" preparation, the difficulties are more fully estimated, the risk of thinking more deeply, play a good first move, play a good initiative, in order to control the crisis, check the danger, to protect the overall situation on the bottom line firmly guarded.

To open up new horizons for the Party's self-revolution on the new journey, we should play the role of a good system to manage the fundamentals and the long term, improve the Party's self-revolutionary system of institutions and norms, give more prominence to the organic connection, linkage and integration, synergy and coordination of the Party's construction in all aspects, give more prominence to the soundness of the institutional mechanism and the scientific and effective nature of the regulations and systems, and give more prominence to the use of the concepts of governance, systemic concepts, and dialectical thinking to manage and govern the Party and to build the Party. Ensure that the Party stays young and vigorous forever. A look at the party's previous centralized educational activities, each time is a vivid practice of self-revolution, each time is a rallying cry for progress. ""Learning to forge the soul, learning to enhance wisdom, learning to correct the wind, learning to promote dryness"", the implementation of the overall strict governance of the Party, requires us to strengthen the understanding of the importance of self-revolution, deepen the understanding of the law of self-revolution, in order to improve the Party's self-revolutionary system of institutional norms to lay a solid ideological foundation. Strengthening party leadership and party building is fundamental. Governing the country must first govern the Party, and only when the Party is flourishing can the country be strong. Into the new era, our party to comprehensively strictly govern the party into the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout of the drawing and planning, from the development and implementation of the central eight provisions of the opening break, perseverance and discipline, to carry out unprecedented anti-corruption struggle, to find a self-revolutionary this jump out of the historical cycle rate of the rise and fall of the second answer. At the same time should be sober to see, the party is facing the ""four tests"" will exist for a long time, ""four dangers"" will exist for a long time. Only by constantly improving the Party's self-revolutionary system of norms, and deeply promoting the new era of the Party's construction of a new great project, can we enhance the Party's self-purification, self-improvement, self-renewal and self-improvement capabilities, and ensure that the Party has always become a strong leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The key to summarizing successful practices and valuable experience. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has promoted the Party's strict governance in all aspects with unprecedented political courage and strategic determination, and played a set of self-revolutionary ""combinations of punches"" to curb a number of crooked winds and evil influences that have not been curbed for many years, solve many long-standing miasmas and chronic diseases, and eliminate serious hidden dangers that existed in the Party, the State and the military, making it possible for the Party, the State, and the military to be more effective and efficient. The Party, the State and the military have eliminated serious hidden dangers, making the Party stronger and more powerful in its revolutionary forging. To continuously consolidate and deepen the hard-won good situation, it is necessary to adhere to the strict tone, strict measures and strict atmosphere for a long time, improve the Party's self-revolutionary system and normative system, combine the requirements of the central government, the expectations of the masses, the actual needs, and the fresh experience, and refine the successful practices and mature experience, so that we can better gather the powerful positive energy that stirs up turbulence and brings forth clarity, and make sure that the Party will never deteriorate in quality, color or taste. The foundation of the Party is to promote systemic and regulatory governance. The Party's internal regulations are born because of the Party, established because of the Party, and emerging because of the Party. Entering the new era, we adhere to the comprehensive rule of law and the system of party governance, rule by rule of the party in a coordinated manner, the construction of a comprehensive realization of the implementation of the party's leadership can be followed, strict control of the party has rules to follow, the advantages of the party regulations and systems continue to be transformed into the governance of the party from the strict governance of the effectiveness of the party in a comprehensive manner, in order to promote the self-revolution of the party to provide a strong guarantee. Embarking on the construction of a strong nation and a new journey of national rejuvenation, we should give full play to the role of political guarantee for ruling the Party in accordance with the rules and regulations, and fix the fine traditions, valuable experiences, and practical achievements of the Party in the self-revolutionary process in the form of institutionalization to accelerate the formation of a scientific, rigorous, and comprehensive system of self-revolutionary regulations of the Party to realize the full coverage of the content, the full coverage of the target audience, the full chain of responsibility, and the full coherence of the system. The report of the 20th CPC National Congress proposes to ""improve the Party's self-revolutionary system"". The Party members and cadres should, through ""learning ideas"", deeply understand and grasp the intrinsic connection of the Party's self-revolutionary system of institutions and norms, understand the key points of the construction, and master the scientific method, so as to make the process of improvement interlocked, layer by layer, step by step, in order to realize the high degree of unity among the Party's self-revolutionary theoretical, practical, and institutional innovations.

Promote the concretization, precision and normalization of political supervision. Political supervision is an important guarantee for realizing the Party's political line, and a powerful measure for urging the whole Party to adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee. To improve the Party's self-revolutionary system and normative system, we need to make greater efforts in concretization, precision and normalization, focusing on the goal and task of comprehensively building a strong socialist modernized country, as well as the complete and accurate implementation of the New Development Concept, accelerating the construction of a new pattern of development, and striving to promote high-quality development, and other major strategic plans to strengthen supervision and inspection, and to provide effective services for the start of a good start in the new journey.

Focusing on ""a hand"" and the leadership team as the focus of supervision, strengthen the supervision of higher-level party organizations, do a solid and detailed supervision at the same level, and urge the leading cadres to be strict in self-discipline, responsibility, and control under their jurisdiction. Powerfully play the role of political inspection sword.

Establish and improve the rectification responsibility system, promotion mechanism and assessment standards, strengthen the daily supervision of rectification and special supervision, strengthen the tracking and supervision, supervise all levels of serious rectification, comprehensive rectification, rectification in a time-bound manner, and enhance the effectiveness of the inspection to promote rectification, inspection to promote the construction, inspection to promote the effectiveness of governance. Implement the political responsibility for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party. Deepen the party's self-revolution, the key to all levels of party organizations and leading cadres to know their responsibilities, responsible for the responsibility, to do up and down one linkage, the formation of the overall synergy. To tighten the chain of responsibility, the fulfillment of the political responsibility for the overall strict governance of the Party as the key to party building, management of power, promote business, the implementation of the key to the party committee (party group) main responsibility, the Commission for Discipline Inspection supervisory responsibility, the responsibility of the industry sector of the integrity of the supervisor to grasp the system into a system to tighten the control of power and authority, risk early warning, traceability and accountability of the institutional cage, in order to systematic governance, the root causes of the concept of governance of the Party. Make full use of the sharp weapon of accountability, not only to prevent the lack of accountability, but also to prevent the generalization of accountability, for dereliction of duty and responsibility resulting in serious consequences, the people's strong reaction, damage to the political foundation of the party's rule, are to be seriously held accountable, not only the main body responsibility, supervisory responsibility, and accountability for the leadership, and resolutely to prevent and rectify the supervision of the ""relaxation"", the disciplinary ""watering down"", the ""watering down"", the ""watering down"" of the discipline. resolutely prevent and rectify the ""relaxation"" of supervision, ""relaxation"" of discipline, and ""relaxation"" of accountability. Third, the implementation of President Xi's important instructions ""to carry out a scientific and objective assessment of the effectiveness of the theme of education,"" the requirements of the new journey to persevere in promoting the Party's self-revolution, we must enhance the institutionalization, standardization and scientific level of the Party's governance, so that the Party's self-revolutionary work to better reflect the times, grasp the regularity, and rich in creativity. The Party's self-revolutionary efforts should better reflect the times, grasp the laws and be rich in creativity. Ideas lead and truth navigate throughout. Thought leads the construction of the system, and the system promotes the implementation of thought. To improve the Party's self-revolutionary system of institutional norms, it is necessary to use Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era to unify thought, will and action. Adhere to the idea of building the Party and the system of party governance in the same direction, so that scientific theories are transformed into institutional norms and established as the basis for action, to ensure the effective implementation of the Party's innovative theories by playing the role of the system to consolidate the fundamentals, enhance the advantages, make up for the shortcomings, and benefit in the long term, and to form a virtuous circle relying on the Party's own strength to identify problems, correct deviations, promote innovation, and realize the overall enhancement of the ability to govern, so as to better promote the unity of the Party's ideology, political unity, and unanimity of its actions. It will better promote the Party's unity of thought, political solidarity and unanimity of action. Systematic and focused promotion will be carried out throughout.

推动基层工作顺利开展，要善于从学习中获得智慧本领 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：王悦 等 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-30 07:27:17 0,从学习中获得智慧本领 主持人语 深入开展第二批主题教育，基层是大头、是主体。对于广大基层官兵而言，要推动基层工作顺利开展，解决阻碍部队建设发展的难题，就必须善于从学习中获得智慧本领。习主席指出，“以学增智，就是要从党的科学理论中悟规律、明方向、学方法、增智慧，把看家本领、兴党本领、强国本领学到手”，并从提升政治能力、提升思维能力、提升实践能力三个方面提出明确要求。如何让以学增智在基层、在一线见到实效，基层官兵结合基层工作实际和备战打仗需要给出了自己的思考和答案。本期选编的这三篇文章，就此话题与读者作一交流。 主持人：王悦 练就一双政治慧眼 ■陆军炮兵防空兵学院  张锦刚 “每名基层党员干部都应在第二批主题教育中带头学习，练就一双政治慧眼，切实做到以学增智，以过硬政治能力推动工作顺利开展。”不久前，某部领导在单位组织的“读原著、学原文、悟原理”活动中的发言，使许多基层党员干部深有同感。 习主席深刻指出，在干部干好工作所需的各种能力中，政治能力是第一位的。政治能力是把握方向、把握大势、把握全局的能力，是辨别政治是非、保持政治定力、驾驭政治局面、防范政治风险的能力，具有全局性、主导性、决定性作用。对于基层党员干部来说，如果缺乏政治能力，认识问题、分析问题就缺乏高度，就难以正确引导官兵思想，难以有效应对复杂形势任务。要使基层官兵在思想上更加统一、在政治上更加团结、在行动上更加一致，就必须练就一双政治慧眼，具备过硬政治能力，确保自己思想上政治上特别坚定，“乱云飞渡仍从容”。 练就一双政治慧眼，必须强化政治意识，善于从政治上看问题。旗帜鲜明讲政治，是我党我军的优良传统和政治优势。是否善于从政治上看问题，是党员干部政治头脑是否清醒、政治立场是否坚定、政治能力是否过硬的直接体现。基层工作千头万绪，基层党员干部在面对问题矛盾时不善于从政治上分析研判，就很有可能无法观其全貌，也就难以找到最合适的解决办法。在利益诱惑面前，只有保持强大政治定力，才能做到不碰红线、不触底线、不越雷池。基层党员干部要不断强化政治意识，观察分析形势把握政治因素，筹划推动工作落实政治要求，处理解决问题防范政治风险，在任何时候任何情况下都“不畏浮云遮望眼”。 练就一双政治慧眼，要在常学常新中加强理论修养，在知行合一中主动担当作为。政治上的坚定离不开理论上的清醒。基层党员干部提高政治能力就要持续加强理论学习，在深入学习党的创新理论中实现以学增智。利用第二批主题教育的契机，基层党员干部要带头学、主动学，要认真读原著、学原文、悟原理，深入学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想特别是习近平强军思想，坚持全面系统学、及时跟进学、深入思考学、联系实际学。学习的最终目的是运用，提升政治能力需要在强军兴军实践中磨砺。只有在基层工作中主动担当作为，运用科学理论方法完成重大任务，分析、解决实际问题，才能切实在强军兴军实践中不断锻造提升政治能力。基层党员干部要始终把“学”的起点和“干”的落点紧密结合在一起，坚持学以致用、用以促学，把党的创新理论蕴含的立场观点方法转化为与岗位职责相匹配的政治能力。 掌握科学思维方法 ■75222部队  李亚洲 思维能力是人类认识世界、改造世界能力的最直接体现。人要使自己聪明起来，最根本的办法是培养思维能力。思维能力关乎工作成效，影响事业成败，广大基层官兵要想切实提高工作能力，就必须掌握科学思维方法，不断强化思维能力。 随着第二批主题教育逐渐推开，我注意到少数官兵虽然也在坚持学习，但只满足于浅尝辄止，学习不系统、不深入，并没有从中总结出认识问题、分析问题的科学思维方法，更别说将之应用于实践。这样的学习往往只是流于形式，无法真正做到以学增智，帮助自己更好地解决问题、推进工作。基层官兵作为部队的主体，是部队建设的基石。广大基层官兵只有不断强化思维能力，才能真正掌握解决问题的科学方法，让第二批主题教育在基层取得实效。 着眼掌握科学思维方法、强化思维能力，首先要深入进行理论学习。科学思维方法往往蕴含于科学理论之中，但倘若只是学在表面，没有深入研究和自我思考，便无法从理论中汲取智慧力量，为提升思维能力积蓄“养分”。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，贯穿着辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观和方法论，既是我们研究问题、解决问题的“总钥匙”，也是政治上军事上的“望远镜”和“显微镜”。把蕴含其中的科学思维方法学到手、运用好，才能把握事物本质和发展规律，切实提高分析问题、解决问题的能力。这就需要广大基层官兵着力把“六个必须坚持”的世界观和方法论、“五个坚持”的军事观和方法论学到手，结合基层实际多进行思考研究，真正从理论中学到科学思维方法，切实增强工作科学性、预见性、主动性、创造性。 着眼掌握科学思维方法、强化思维能力，还要注重将学习与实践相结合。习主席强调：“要坚持理论和实践相结合，注重在实践中学真知、悟真谛，加强磨练、增长本领。”理论学习学得再好，不付诸实践，“养分”就无法消化，强化思维能力也就沦为空谈。只有坚持弘扬理论联系实际的学风，才能不断在实践历练中运用科学思维方法推动工作开展。对此，广大基层官兵要勇于承担重任，在急难险重任务中锻炼思维能力；要敢于直面基层现实问题和矛盾困难，利用所学理论结合实际破解难题。通过反复磨练、总结经验，将理论学习的成果通过实践充分转化为思维能力的飞跃，推动基层工作高效开展，促进部队建设提质增效。 用学习为实践赋能 ■65367部队  孟璠玙 习主席指出：“增强本领就要加强学习，既把学到的知识运用于实践，又在实践中增长解决问题的新本领。”这要求广大基层党员干部扎扎实实在以学增智上下硬功夫、狠功夫，用学习为实践赋能。 “事有所成，必是学有所成。”毛泽东同志曾说：“《共产党宣言》我看了不下一百遍，每阅读一次，我都有新的启发。”正是我们党对学习的高度重视，革命先辈们在战斗岁月中坚持学习，才为最终夺取革命的胜利打下了坚实的基础。第二批主题教育已经在基层部队广泛开展，基层党员干部要以此为契机做到以学增智，持续通过学习打牢干事创业的本领、提升实践的能力。只有这样，才能更好解决阻碍基层建设发展的矛盾问题，推动基层工作有序高效开展。 “绳短不能汲深井，浅水难以负大舟。”当前，基层部队发展呈现出专业性、关联性强的特征，各项工作的专业化、专门化、精细化程度越来越高。个别基层党员干部到官兵中开展调研会出现“虎头蛇尾”的情况，来的时候信心满满，要为基层排忧解难，真正面对官兵提出的“急、难、愁、盼”问题时却束手无策。出现这种情况，说到底还是自身专业素养不过硬。没有金刚钻，揽不了瓷器活。基层党员干部要聚焦提升自己的专业素质，针对相应岗位、相应职级、相应专业的要求设计学习计划，从实际需要出发，在增强学习质效上下功夫。坚持“干什么学什么，缺什么补什么”的原则，针对自身能力建设的短板和弱项，量身定制学习内容，让学习的“供”与“需”精准对接，不断提高知识水平，以过硬专业能力推动解决实际问题。 “纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行。”实践是知识向能力转化的载体，实践能力的提升离不开学用结合。笔者在调研中发现，有的基层党员干部虽然也在不断学理论，处理问题时却仍存在“经验思维”，面对新问题继续使用老一套的办法，既解决不了问题，还白白浪费了时间，这就是典型的学用脱节。时代在变、形势任务在变，对基层党员干部的实践能力也提出了新的更高的要求，只有不断学习新知识、开拓新视野、了解新领域，增强自身的知识储备，才能在工作实践中有“源头活水”、在攻克“疑难杂症”时“对症下药”。要注重学用结合，坚持用学到的理论指导工作实践，并在实践中学真知、悟真谛，切实增长实践本领，真正做到学思用贯通、知信行统一。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231202234951/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269997.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130193417/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269997.html,2023-12-03 0:00:00,"To promote the smooth development of grass-roots work, we must be good at gaining wisdom and competence from learning Source: China Military Network-Jiefangjun Daily Author: Wang Yue, etc. Editor-in-chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-30 07:27:17 0","From learning to gain wisdom and competence Moderator language In-depth development of the second batch of theme education, grass-roots is the big head, is the main body. For the majority of grass-roots officers and soldiers, in order to promote the smooth implementation of grass-roots work, to solve the problems that hinder the development of the construction of the army, we must be good at learning from the wisdom of the skills. President Xi pointed out that ""to learn to increase wisdom, is to understand the law from the Party's scientific theories, clear direction, learning methods, increase wisdom, the watchword, the Party, the strong country to learn,"" and from the enhancement of political ability, enhance the ability to think, enhance the ability to practice the three aspects of the clear requirements. How to make learning to increase wisdom at the grassroots, in the front line to see the effect, grass-roots officers and soldiers combined with the actual grass-roots work and preparation for war needs to give their own thinking and answers. The three articles selected for this issue will be exchanged with readers on this topic. Moderator: Wang Yue practice a pair of political eyes ■ Army Artillery Air Defense College Zhang Jingang ""Each grass-roots party members and cadres should take the lead in the second batch of thematic education to learn, practice a pair of political eyes, and effectively do to learn to increase wisdom, to promote the smooth implementation of the work of the excellent political ability."" Not long ago, the leadership of a ministry in the unit organized by the ""read the original text, learn the original text, understand the principle of"" activities, so that many grass-roots party members and cadres feel the same way. President Xi profoundly pointed out that, in the cadres to do a good job in a variety of capabilities, political ability is the first. Political ability is the ability to grasp the direction, grasp the general situation, grasp the overall situation, is the ability to distinguish political right and wrong, maintain political stability, manage the political situation, the ability to prevent political risks, has a global, dominant, decisive role. For grass-roots party members and cadres, if the lack of political ability to understand the problem, analyze the problem lack of height, it is difficult to correctly guide the thinking of officers and soldiers, difficult to effectively respond to complex situations and tasks. To make grass-roots officers and soldiers in the ideological more unified, more politically united, more consistent in action, we must practice a pair of political vision, with excellent political ability, to ensure that their own ideological and political special firm, ""chaotic clouds are still calm"". Practicing a pair of political vision, must strengthen political awareness, good at looking at the problem from the political. Speak clearly about politics, is the excellent tradition and political advantage of our party and our army. Whether good at political problems, is the party cadres political mind is sober, whether the political position is firm, whether the political ability of the direct embodiment of the hard. Grass-roots work is complicated, grass-roots party members and cadres in the face of problems and contradictions are not good at analyzing and judging from the political point of view, it is likely to be unable to see the whole picture, it is also difficult to find the most appropriate solution. In front of the temptation of interest, only to maintain a strong political force, in order to do not touch the red line, do not touch the bottom line, do not cross the minefield. Grass-roots party members and cadres should continue to strengthen political awareness, observe and analyze the situation to grasp the political factors, planning to promote the implementation of political requirements, to deal with the problem to prevent political risk, at any time in any situation are ""not afraid of the clouds overlooking the eyes"". Practicing a pair of political vision, we must always learn to strengthen the theoretical cultivation, in the unity of knowledge and action to take the initiative to act. Political firmness is inseparable from theoretical sobriety. Grass-roots party members and cadres to improve political capacity to continue to strengthen theoretical learning, in-depth study of the Party's innovative theories to realize the learning of wisdom. Using the opportunity of the second batch of thematic education, grassroots Party members and cadres should take the lead and take the initiative to learn, read the original text, learn the original text, understand the principle, in-depth study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, especially Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, adhere to the comprehensive and systematic study, follow up on the study in a timely manner, in-depth thinking, and in touch with the practical study. The ultimate goal of learning is to use, enhance political ability needs to be sharpened in the practice of strengthening the army. Only in the grass-roots work to take the initiative to act, the use of scientific theory and method to complete major tasks, analyze and solve practical problems, in order to effectively in the practice of the army to continue to forge and improve the political capacity. Grass-roots party members and cadres should always ""learn"" the starting point and ""dry"" point closely together, adhere to the learning to use, use to promote learning, the party's innovative theory of the position and viewpoints of the method into a position matching the responsibilities of the political capacity. The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing and how you're doing it. The most fundamental way to make yourself smart is to cultivate the ability to think. Thinking ability is related to the effectiveness of the work, affecting the success or failure of the cause, the majority of grass-roots officers and soldiers want to effectively improve the ability to work, it is necessary to master the scientific method of thinking, and constantly strengthen the ability to think. With the second batch of thematic education gradually pushed, I noticed that a few officers and soldiers, although also adhere to the study, but only satisfied with the shallow, learning not systematic, not in-depth, and did not summarize the understanding of the problem, the analysis of the problem of scientific thinking methods, not to mention applying it to practice. Such learning is often just a formality, can not really do to learn to increase wisdom, to help themselves better solve problems and promote the work. Basic officers and soldiers as the main body of the army, is the cornerstone of the construction of the army. The majority of grass-roots officers and soldiers only continue to strengthen the ability to think, in order to truly master the scientific method of problem solving, so that the second batch of thematic education at the grass-roots level to achieve practical results. Focus on mastering scientific thinking methods, strengthen thinking ability, first of all, in-depth theoretical study. Scientific thinking methods are often embedded in scientific theories, but if you only learn on the surface, without in-depth study and self-reflection, you will not be able to draw wisdom from the theory, to enhance the thinking ability to accumulate ""nutrients"". Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is permeated with the worldview and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, which is not only the ""master key"" for us to study and solve problems, but also the ""telescope"" and ""microscope"" for us politically and militarily. It is also a political and military ""telescope"" and ""microscope"". The scientific method of thinking contained therein can be learned and applied well in order to grasp the essence of things and the laws of development, and effectively improve the ability to analyze and solve problems. This requires the majority of grass-roots officers and soldiers to focus on the ""six must adhere to"" the world view and methodology, ""five adhere to"" the military view and methodology to learn, combined with the grass-roots level of the actual thinking and research, really from the theory of the scientific thinking method, and effectively enhance the work of scientific, foresight, initiative. The work of scientific, foresight, initiative and creativity. Focus on mastering scientific thinking methods, strengthen thinking ability, but also focus on combining learning and practice. President Xi emphasized: ""We must adhere to the combination of theory and practice, focusing on the practice of learning the true knowledge, realize the true meaning, strengthen the honing, growth of skills."" Theoretical learning is good, not put into practice, ""nutrients"" can not be digested, strengthen the thinking ability will be reduced to empty talk. Only adhere to the promotion of theory and practice of the learning style, in order to continue to practice in the practice of scientific thinking methods to promote the work. In this regard, the majority of grass-roots officers and soldiers should be willing to take on heavy responsibilities, in the urgent and dangerous tasks to exercise thinking ability; to dare to face the reality of grass-roots problems and contradictions and difficulties, the use of theories combined with the practical to crack the problem. Through repeated honing and summarizing experience, the results of theoretical learning through practice fully transformed into a leap in thinking ability to promote the efficient development of grass-roots work, and promote the quality of the construction of the force to increase efficiency. Empowering Practice with Learning ■ 65367th Corps I hope you will recognize that President Xi pointed out, ""Strengthening one's skills requires strengthening one's learning, applying what one has learned in practice, and developing new skills in solving problems in practice."" This requires that the majority of grassroots Party members and cadres make a solid effort to enhance their knowledge through learning, and to use learning to empower their practice. ""Things are accomplished, must be learned."" Comrade Mao Zedong once said, ""I have read the Communist Manifesto no less than a hundred times, and every time I read it, I have new inspiration."" It was our Party's high regard for learning and the insistence of our revolutionary forefathers on learning during their fighting years that laid a solid foundation for the eventual victory of the revolution. The second batch of thematic education has been widely carried out in the grass-roots forces, the grass-roots Party members and cadres should take this opportunity to do to learn to enhance wisdom, and continue to learn through learning to build up the skills of officers and entrepreneurs, and enhance the ability to practice. Only in this way can we better solve the contradictions and problems that hinder the development of grassroots construction and promote the orderly and efficient development of grassroots work. ""A short rope cannot draw a deep well, and shallow water is difficult to carry a large boat."" At present, the development of grass-roots forces presents the characteristics of professionalism and relevance, and the degree of specialization, specialization and refinement of all work is increasingly high. Individual grass-roots party members and cadres to the officers and soldiers to carry out research will appear ""tiger head, snake tail"" situation, to come when confident, to solve problems for the grass-roots level, the real face of the officers and soldiers to put forward the ""urgent, difficult, worry, hope"" problem but can not do anything about it. This situation, in the final analysis, or their own professionalism is not good. There is no diamond drill, can not take porcelain work. Grass-roots party members and cadres should focus on improving their professional qualities, for the appropriate positions, the appropriate level, the appropriate professional requirements for the design of the learning program, from the actual need to start, in order to enhance the quality of learning on the effort. Adhere to the principle of ""what to do what to learn, what is missing to make up for what"", for their own capacity building of short boards and weaknesses, customized learning content, so that the ""supply"" and ""demand"" of learning precision! Docking, and constantly improve the level of knowledge, with a strong professional ability to promote the solution of practical problems. ""The knowledge gained on paper is not as shallow as it should be, and the knowledge of the matter has to be practiced."" Practice is the knowledge to the ability to transform the carrier, the ability to improve practice is inseparable from the combination of learning and use. I found in the research, some grass-roots party members and cadres, although they also continue to learn the theory, dealing with the problem still exists ""experience thinking"", in the face of new problems continue to use the old set of methods, not only to solve the problem, but also a waste of time, which is typical of the use of learning disconnect. Times are changing, the situation and tasks are changing, the ability of grass-roots party members and cadres of the practice has also put forward new and higher requirements, only to continue to learn new knowledge, open up new horizons, understanding of the new areas, enhance their knowledge reserves, in order to work in practice there is a ""source of living water"", in the attack on the ""difficult and miscellaneous problems ""When"" the right medicine ""to"". To focus on the combination of learning and use, adhere to the theory learned to guide the practice of work, and in practice to learn the true knowledge, realize the true meaning of the practical growth of the practical skills, and truly achieve the learning of thinking and use of coherent, knowledge, letter and action unity.","This summary highlights the importance of learning and applying scientific methods of thinking to effectively address the issues that hinder the development of grass-roots work. To promote the smooth implementation of grass-roots work and address these issues, grass-roots officers and soldiers must learn from the wisdom and skills gained through studying scientific theories. President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for political ability, excellent political ability, and the ability to solve practical problems, all of which are closely tied to learning and improved thinking skills.

To effectively enhance the learning process and practical application, grass-roots officers and soldiers must focus on mastering scientific thinking methods, which are embedded in scientific theories, and apply them to analyze and solve problems. Learning from the theory and applying it to practice is essential, as it allows for the gap between learning and application to be bridged. Additionally, the use of learning to empower practice is crucial, as learning should be applied to work effectively and achieve goals.

实现远大理想、开创光明前景，要握紧艰苦奋斗的“接力棒” 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：李  远 责任编辑：孙悦 2023-11-30 07:23:45 0,艰苦奋斗的作风本色不能丢 ■李  远 ●实现远大理想、开创光明前景，离不开筚路蓝缕、手胼足胝的艰苦奋斗 艰苦奋斗是中华民族血脉相传、生生不息的动力源泉，是我们党历经百年而风华正茂、饱经磨难而不断进取的精神力量，是人民军队的传家宝。在《习近平著作选读》第二卷《开展党史学习教育要突出重点》一文中，习主席强调：“进一步发扬革命精神，始终保持艰苦奋斗的昂扬精神。”艰苦奋斗不仅是我们党一路走来、不断发展壮大的重要保证，也是我们党继往开来、再创辉煌的重要保证。作为新时代革命军人，一定要继承发扬我党我军优良传统，矢志不渝艰苦奋斗，为强国强军事业作出自己的贡献。 创业维艰，奋斗以成。实现远大理想、开创光明前景，离不开筚路蓝缕、手胼足胝的艰苦奋斗。中华民族向来以勤劳勇敢、不畏艰苦著称，用勤劳和智慧创造了五千年文明史。艰苦奋斗同样也是中国共产党的政治本色。一百多年来，我们党从小到大、由弱到强，克服一个又一个困难，取得一个又一个胜利，就是凭着那么一股革命加拼命的强大精神，艰苦奋斗、不懈奋斗。从人民军队发展历程看，井冈山上的燎原星火，绝处逢生的万里长征，在延安“自力更生、艰苦奋斗”的峥嵘岁月……人民军队在血与火、艰与险的斗争中谱写了一部部艰苦奋斗的壮丽史诗。当前，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开，我国发展进入战略机遇与风险挑战并存的时期，面对艰巨繁重的使命任务，艰苦奋斗的作风和本色须臾不能丢，更加需要我们把艰苦奋斗当成一种自觉、一种习惯，在思想上真正扎根、在行动上自觉体现。 保持艰苦奋斗的作风本色，必须不断从中国共产党人的精神谱系、革命先辈的风骨品质中汲取营养、净化灵魂。习主席指出，要教育引导全党大力发扬红色传统、传承红色基因，赓续共产党人精神血脉，始终保持革命者的大无畏奋斗精神。艰苦奋斗是共产党人强大的精神力量，始终激励着共产党人百折不挠、锐意进取。我们要笃定爱党爱国的价值追求，发扬革命先辈“风雨浸衣骨更硬，野菜充饥志越坚”的拼搏精神，“砍头不要紧，只要主义真”的牺牲精神，践行对党忠诚、不负人民的铮铮誓言。要培育甘于奉献的精神品质，以“功成不必在我、功成必定有我”的境界勇于担当，正确对待荣辱得失，扎扎实实干工作，默默无闻作贡献，在平凡的岗位上干出不平凡的业绩。要涵养乐于奋斗的高尚情怀，看重奋斗的结果，更要享受奋斗的过程。艰苦奋斗是一个磨砺意志、提升能力、成就事业的过程，要把艰苦当财富，把奋斗当幸福，在艰苦奋斗中不断激发潜力、迎难而上、超越自我。 保持艰苦奋斗的作风本色，就要不贪图安逸，不惧怕困难，依靠勤劳和汗水开辟事业前程。前进道路上，既有风平浪静，也有暗礁险滩，如果在“承平”时选择安逸，在“激流”中选择退却，就看不到奋斗路上的风景，更不会有成长与收获。要如期实现建军一百年奋斗目标，加快把人民军队建成世界一流军队，每一名革命军人都必须不畏艰难、锐意进取，跳出“舒适圈”，勇于开拓创新；保持不怕困难、百折不挠的顽强意志，勇于克服前进道路上的一切艰难险阻；树立兢兢业业、无私奉献的工作态度，做好每一项具体工作，落实好每一项具体职责，用扎实务实的行动把强军事业推向前进。 保持艰苦奋斗的作风本色，难在始终、贵在坚持。无论是海上斗风浪、戈壁踏狂沙，还是刻苦研战法、沙场强本领，许多同志都有过艰苦奋斗的经历。但昨天艰苦奋斗了，不代表今天就能艰苦奋斗，更不意味着明天会继续艰苦奋斗，也不能保证条件变了、环境变了，依然能够坚守初心、昂扬奋进。当前，长期的和平环境使少数官兵忧患意识淡化、昂扬斗志衰退，有的顺境时意气风发，一旦碰到挫折就没了斗志、少了心气；有的把“瓶颈期”当成“天花板”，努力了几次没有突破就选择“躺平”、不思进取；有的打“小算盘”，不敢当“热锅上的蚂蚁”、不愿接“烫手的山芋”，丧失了磨练自我、提升自我的机会。艰苦奋斗没有休止符，也没有暂停键，我们必须把一切贪图安逸、不愿继续艰苦奋斗的想法，一切骄傲自满、不愿继续开拓前进的想法从头脑中剔除，经常“照照镜子”，看看自己艰苦奋斗的本色丢没丢；经常“摸摸内心”，问问自己艰苦奋斗的意志强不强；经常“紧紧发条”，握紧艰苦奋斗的“接力棒”，以昂扬精神和实际行动在新征程上把艰苦奋斗光荣传统进一步发扬光大。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231202234951/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269996.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130084048/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269996.html,2023-12-03 0:00:00,"To realize the lofty ideals and create a bright future, we must hold on to the ""baton"" of hard struggle Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Li Yuan Editor in Chief: Sun Yue 2023-11-30 07:23:45 0","The style of hard work cannot be lost ■ Li Yuan ● realize the lofty ideals and create a bright future, can not be separated from the wickerwork, calloused hard work Hard work is the blood of the Chinese nation, the source of endless power, is our party through the centuries but the flourishing, full of trials and tribulations but the spirit of the power to continue to forge ahead, is the heirloom of the people's army. In the article ""Carrying out Party History Study and Education to Highlight the Key Points"" in the second volume of Xi Jinping's Selected Writings, President Xi emphasized, ""Further carry forward the spirit of the revolution, and always maintain the high spirit of hard struggle."" Hard work is not only an important guarantee for our Party to go all the way and keep developing and growing, but also an important guarantee for our Party to carry on and create another brilliant future. As a revolutionary soldier in the new era, we must inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our Party and our army, unswervingly struggle hard, and make our own contribution to the cause of strengthening the country and the army. Entrepreneurship is arduous, and struggle is the key to success. The realization of lofty ideals and the creation of a bright future cannot be separated from the hard work of wickerwork and hard work. The Chinese nation has always been known for its diligence, courage and fear of hardship, and has created a civilized history of 5,000 years with hard work and wisdom. Hard work is also the political nature of the CPC. For more than a hundred years, our Party has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, overcoming one difficulty after another, and achieving one victory after another, thanks to the powerful spirit of revolution and desperation, hard work and unremitting struggle. From the development of the people's army, the prairie fire on the Jinggang Mountains, the survival of the Long March, in Yan'an, ""self-reliance, hard work"" of the great years ...... people's army in the blood and fire, hardship and danger in the struggle composed a part of the magnificent struggle! The people's army has written a magnificent epic of hard work in the midst of blood, fire, hardship and danger. At present, the change of the world, the change of the times, the change of history is unfolding in an unprecedented way, China's development has entered a period of strategic opportunities and risks and challenges, in the face of the arduous and heavy mission, the style and character of hard work can't be lost, and it is even more necessary for us to take hard work as a kind of self-consciousness, a kind of habit, in the ideology of the real roots, in the action of the consciously embodied. To maintain the style and character of hard work, we must constantly draw nourishment and purify our souls from the spiritual genealogy of the Chinese communists and the bones and qualities of our revolutionary forefathers. President Xi pointed out that we should educate and guide the whole party to vigorously carry forward the red tradition and inherit the red gene, continue the spiritual lineage of the Communists, and always maintain the revolutionary spirit of fearless struggle. Hard struggle is a powerful spiritual force for communists, always inspiring them to be indomitable and enterprising. We must be sure to love the party and patriotic values, carry forward the revolutionary ancestors, ""wind and rain soaked clothes bone harder, wild vegetables hunger, the stronger the will,"" the spirit of struggle, ""it does not matter if you cut off the head, as long as the doctrine of truth,"" the spirit of sacrifice, to fulfill the loyalty to the party, not to live up to the people's oath of the solemn. To cultivate the spirit of dedication to the quality of ""success does not have to be in me, success must have my"" realm of courage to take responsibility, correctly treat honor and disgrace gains and losses, do a solid job, silent contribution, in an ordinary position to do extraordinary performance. To cultivate the noble feelings of struggle, valuing the results of the struggle, but also to enjoy the process of struggle. Hard work is a process of sharpening the will, enhance the ability to achieve the cause, we must take the hardship as wealth, the struggle as happiness, in the hard struggle to constantly stimulate the potential to rise to the occasion, beyond the self.

On the road ahead, both calm, there are reefs and shoals, if the ""peace"" when choosing comfort, in the ""rapids"" in the choice to retreat, you can not see the struggle on the road to the scenery, not to mention the growth and harvest. To achieve the goal of one hundred years of the army on schedule, and accelerate the people's army to build a world-class army, every revolutionary soldier must fear no hardship, forge ahead, jump out of the ""comfort zone"", and the courage to explore and innovate; to maintain the tenacity of will not be afraid of difficulties, indomitable, and the courage to overcome all the difficulties on the road; to set up a dedicated, selfless and dedicated attitude to work! The work attitude of conscientiousness and selflessness, do a good job in every specific job, implement every specific duty, with solid and pragmatic action to push forward the cause of a strong army. Maintaining a hard-working style of character, difficult at all times, expensive to adhere to. Whether it is the sea fighting the wind and waves, the Gobi step on the wild sand, or hard research method of warfare, the sand field strong skills, many comrades have had a hard experience. But yesterday's hard work, does not mean that today can be hard work, not to mention that tomorrow will continue to work hard, and can not guarantee that the conditions have changed, the environment has changed, still be able to adhere to the original heart, and forge ahead. At present, the long-term peaceful environment so that a small number of officers and soldiers sense of concern diluted, the decline of high morale, some of the good times when the wind, once encountered setbacks on the lack of will to fight, less heart; some of the ""bottleneck"" as the ""ceiling"", and efforts to several times without a breakthrough on the Choose to ""lie flat"", do not want to forge ahead; some play ""small plan"", do not dare to be ""ants on the hot pot"", unwilling to take ""hot potato "", lost the opportunity to hone themselves and improve themselves. Hard work has no stopgap, there is no pause button, we must put all the comfort, unwilling to continue the idea of hard work, all the complacency, unwilling to continue to develop the idea of moving forward from the mind, often ""look in the mirror"", look at their own hard work of the nature of the loss or not lost; often ""touch the heart"", ask the ""hot potato"", not dare to be ""ants in the hot pot"", unwilling to take the ""hot potato"", lost the opportunity to hone themselves, enhance their own.

发挥兵棋推演优势，辅助指挥员筹划作战 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：晓彬  李治军 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-30 06:55:46 0,让兵棋助推筹划能力提升 ■晓彬  李治军 指挥员是驱动现代战争体系运转的大脑，“庙算胜敌”是指挥员在看不见的战场上与敌较量的最高境界。发挥兵棋推演支持全局筹划、聚焦重点、强化认知的优势，辅助指挥员筹划作战，是提高指挥筹划能力的重要途径，也是做好战争准备的重要抓手。 研判情况是指挥员指挥筹划的前提，要对预先掌握的原始数据进行甄别、加工、处理，切实做到去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里。通常要分析研判担负的任务、上级的意图、面临的战场环境等情况，为定下决心方案提供依据。兵棋推演运用于研判情况过程，可以通过量化设定作战要素、可视化展示敌我态势、动态添加作战变量等，帮助指挥员更加全面、动态、灵活地把握战场情况，得出准确研判结论。 指挥员作战筹划的目标是定下决心，主要通过方案评估优选、对比排序和修订完善，形成一案为主、多案为辅的方案体系，完整准确反映指挥员意图和总体作战部署。定下决心意味着作战方案臻于成熟，付诸实战应能基本达成作战企图，决心方案的可行性、效费比、风险度等将极大影响作战效果。兵棋推演既能量化设定各种客观条件，又能突出推演人员战法、谋略和战场不确定性等影响，从而充分“打磨”作战方案，挤出各种“水分”。 作战计划是指挥员决心方案的具体化，主要对兵力编配、行动过程、指挥协同、支援保障等作出具体安排，以便部队依令行动。制定作战计划过程中，保留充足作战冗余与减轻部队行动负担、部队经验习惯与强敌意外突袭、预设作战进程与战局偏离预期等方面的矛盾极难避免。兵棋推演系统支持断点续推、推演规模自主可控、异地联动推演等特色化功能，可以在计划准备时限宽裕、临战紧前准备、战中动态调控等不同时节，平行展开计划推演，将高效时间效益转化为最佳作战效益。 洞察敌情、隐真示假，始终是战场指挥对抗的重心。通过掌握对手的历史行为规律和现实活动迹象等，可以在一定程度上察知对手的身份属性、行动方式、打击目标和作战企图等，进而为主动调整部署、有效塑造战场态势创造条件。现代兵棋正在快速向人机混合智能博弈方向发展，智能系统能更快捷运算和发现“可乘之机”，以其作为蓝队“不按套路出牌”来摔打磨炼红队，能够最大限度发挥指挥对抗张力，突破人脑思维定势、贴近实战认知对手，做好应对复杂局面准备。 现代战场战机稍纵即逝，能否敏锐地把握战机是指挥员用兵制胜的要诀。把握战机，既要有预判和应对战机的超前部署，也要有发现信号、敢于决断的战略勇气。随着现代战争高科技兵器大量使用，在“看不见对手”的战场上如何把握战机，变得愈发重要且困难。利用兵棋，可以在多种情况输入、多场次反复推演中逐渐使牵动战局的枢纽或关节清晰化，并可能使对手营造的假象在推演作用下相互矛盾而暴露真相，从而使指挥员避免认知误区，集中精力打好决定胜局的关键性作战。 推动战局是指挥员从全局出发驾驭战场、塑造胜势的重要任务。通过理性客观评估态势、调整预期、掌控部队，能使指挥员以当前战局为基点，通过最可行的兵力调配和战法运用达成最佳战役结果。计算机兵棋系统既可以呈现攻防对抗的全局态势，也可以有效组织上下级指挥员同步联动推演，上级推演的阶段性态势可以作为下级推演的情况输入，下级指挥员依托本级兵棋系统完成具体问题推演并形成结论建议，反馈给上级作为下步推演的情况输入，从而保证指挥员更有效地把握整体和局部，推动战局向预期方向发展。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231202234951/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269995.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231130150015/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269995.html,2023-12-03 0:00:00,Utilizing the Advantages of Military Chess Rehearsal to Aid Commanders in Planning Operations Source: china military net - liberation army newspaper Author: xiaobin Li zhijun Responsibility: yixi ram 2023-11-30 06:55:46 0,"Let the military chess boost planning ability to improve ■ Xiaobin Li Zhijun commander is to drive the modern war system operation of the brain, ""temple calculations to win the enemy"" is the commander in the unseen battlefield with the enemy in the highest realm. Give full play to the advantages of military chess projection to support the overall planning, focus on key points, and strengthen the cognition to assist the commander in planning for combat, is an important way to improve the command and planning capabilities, but also an important hand to do a good job in preparing for war. Research and judgment of the situation is the premise of the commanders command planning, to pre-acquired raw data screening, processing, processing, and effectively do the rough to extract the essence, to remove the false and keep the true, and from this to the other, from the table to the inside. Usually, it is necessary to analyze and judge the task, the intention of superiors and the battlefield environment to provide a basis for the determination of the program. Military chess deduction is used in the process of studying and judging the situation, which can help the commander grasp the battlefield situation more comprehensively, dynamically and flexibly through quantitatively setting the combat elements, visually displaying the enemy's and our postures, and dynamically adding combat variables, etc., so as to draw accurate conclusions for the study and judgment. The goal of the commander's combat planning is to make up his mind, mainly through program evaluation and selection, comparison and sequencing and revision and improvement, to form a case-based, multi-case program system, which completely and accurately reflects the commander's intentions and overall combat deployment. Determination means that the combat program has reached maturity, and should be able to basically achieve the combat attempts when it is put into practice, and the feasibility of the determination program, the efficiency and cost ratio, and the degree of risk will greatly affect the combat effect. The military chess rehearsal can both quantify and set various objective conditions, but also highlight the influence of the rehearsal personnel's tactics, strategies and battlefield uncertainty, so as to fully ""polish"" the combat program, and squeeze out all kinds of ""water"". Operational plan is the specificization of the commander's determination program, mainly on the deployment of troops, the course of action, command and coordination, support and security, etc. to make specific arrangements so that the troops act according to the order. In the process of formulating combat plans, it is extremely difficult to avoid the contradiction between retaining sufficient combat redundancy and reducing the burden of troop operations, the experience and habits of the troops and the unexpected surprise attack of the enemy, the preset course of combat and the deviation of the battle situation from the expected. The military chess rehearsal system supports the features such as breakpoint renewal rehearsal, autonomous and controllable rehearsal scale, and heterogeneous linkage rehearsal, etc., which can launch the plan rehearsal in parallel in different seasons such as the time limit for plan preparation is wide, the preparations for the imminent battle are tight, and the battle is in the midst of the dynamic regulation, etc., and turn the high efficiency of time benefit into the optimal combat benefit. Insight into the enemy's situation, hidden truth and falsehood, is always the center of gravity of the battlefield command confrontation. By mastering the opponent's historical behavioral patterns and signs of real activities, we can, to a certain extent, know the opponent's identity attributes, modes of action, combat objectives and combat attempts, and thus create conditions for proactive adjustment of deployment and effective shaping of battlefield postures. Modern military chess is rapidly developing to the direction of human-machine hybrid intelligent game, intelligent system can be more quickly calculated and found that the ""opportunity to take advantage of"", as the blue team ""not according to the set of cards"" to wrestle and refine the red team, can maximize the command confrontation tension, break through the human brain thinking stereotypes, close to the battlefield. The human brain thinking stereotypes, close to the actual battle cognitive opponents, ready to deal with complex situations. Modern battlefield opportunities are fleeting, whether or not to keenly grasp the opportunity is the commander to use the military to win the trick. Grasp the opportunity, not only to anticipate and respond to the war plan ahead of the deployment, but also to have found the signal, dare to decide the strategic courage. With the modern war high-tech weapons used in large quantities, in the ""invisible opponent"" on the battlefield how to grasp the opportunity to fight, become more and more important and difficult. The use of military chess, can be in a variety of situations input, many times in the repeated rehearsals gradually make the pivot or joints of the battlefield clear, and may make the opponent to create the illusion in the role of the rehearsal of the contradictions and exposure of the truth, so as to enable the commander to avoid cognitive misunderstanding, and to focus on playing a good decision to win the game of the key combat. Promoting the battle situation is an important task for commanders to manage the battlefield and shape the winning situation from the overall perspective. By rationally and objectively evaluating the situation, adjusting expectations and controlling the troops, it enables the commander to take the current battle situation as the base point and achieve the best battle results through the most feasible deployment of troops and the application of war tactics. The computerized military chess system can present the overall situation of offensive and defensive confrontation, and can also effectively organize synchronous linkage exercises for commanders at the upper and lower levels. The stage situation of the upper level exercises can be used as the input for the lower level exercises, and the lower level commanders can complete the specific issues of the exercises relying on this level of the military chess system and form the conclusions and suggestions, which can be fed back to the higher level as the input for the next step of the exercises, thus ensuring that the commanders can grasp the whole and the local situation more effectively, and promote the development of the battle situation in the expected direction. This ensures that commanders can more effectively grasp the overall and local situation and promote the development of the battlefield in the expected direction.","The article discusses the use of military chess to aid commanders in planning operations. By utilizing the advantages of military chess projection, commanders can enhance their planning and decision-making abilities, as well as prepare for war better.

Grasp the times. Modern military governance system, the most notable sign lies in the word ""modern"", with prominent characteristics of the times. As an important component of the modernization of the national governance system and the inevitable product, the modern military governance system is different from the ancient Chinese and modern Western governance system, in line with the characteristics of the times, to meet the needs of the reality, and to lead the development trend of the governance system. To build a modern military governance system, we should focus on the goal of building the military for a hundred years, aim at the goal of building a world-class army, and build a forward-looking, innovative, and leading military governance framework and pattern on the basis of comprehensively sorting out the contradictions and problems in the efficient operation of the military system. To build a modern military governance system, it is necessary to gain a deep insight into the international and domestic security situation, accurately grasp the internal and external construction environment of the military, look forward to the development trend of the times, and clearly define the functional positioning of the main body of national defense and military construction and the focus of efforts, so as to ensure that the system of military governance not only guides and regulates the current construction of national defense and the military but also demonstrates the role of traction in the future development of the military. The construction of a modern military governance system is to strengthen the concept of governance, consolidate the foundation of governance, and enhance governance capacity, with the ultimate goal of modernizing the military governance system and governance capacity, promoting the high-quality development of our military with high-level governance, and providing a strong guarantee for the realization of the goal of building the military for one hundred years. Complete systematic. The modern military governance system is a synergistic governance system in which all levels, fields, subjects and elements of national defense and military construction are closely coordinated, functionally coupled and mutually compatible. Building a modern military governance system should focus on the overall linkage of multiple subjects, coordination and interaction, which is conducive to clarifying the interrelationships between different governance subjects in the military governance system, ensuring benign interaction between the governance subjects, and maintaining a good momentum in the development of national defense and military construction. The construction of a modern military governance system should be based on the rule of law, the formation of the same level of subject close collaboration, different levels of subject cooperation, the various levels of the subject of a good pattern of concerted efforts, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the main body of governance initiative creativity, to maximize the overall effectiveness of military governance. To build a modern military governance system, we should take strategic management as the pivot, take combat effectiveness as the only fundamental standard, and point to the preparation for war as the direction, focusing on the generation of military governance effectiveness, focusing on the major tasks of systematic combat effectiveness construction, abandoning departmentalism, localism, breaking the inertia thinking, path dependence, dealing with the relationship between the immediate interests, local interests, long-term interests and the overall interests, not counting the small accounts. Instead, they are counting the big accounts to ensure the efficient implementation of the army's construction planning. Speaking of science and technology. The modern military governance system is a system of scientific and technological innovation, information empowerment, and intelligent efficiency, with strong scientific and technological characteristics. In the era of informatization and intelligence, science and technology play a crucial role in the military governance system, and this role will be continuously enhanced with the continuous development of science and technology. To build a modern military governance system, we should actively adapt to the profound transformation of the war pattern, adhere to science and technology as the core fighting force, pay attention to the penetration and application of advanced science and technology such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and other advanced science and technology in the whole process of military governance in all aspects of the field, to help prepare for war and fight the war ability to significantly improve, and to effectively win the future of informatization and intelligent war. Building a modern military governance system should actively adapt to the needs of military reform and development, focusing on the use of modern science and technology, through big data analysis, cloud platform support, intelligent assisted decision-making and other means to empower the national defense and military construction to increase efficiency, and constantly improve the level of information technology and intelligence of military governance. To build a modern military governance system, we should actively adapt to the changes in the quality structure of military personnel, focus on the important role of scientific and technological talents, vigorously enhance the scientific and technological content of military governance, promote the organic combination of people and science and technology, in-depth integration, and promote more efficient and fair military governance. Strengthen the integration. The modern military governance system is a structural governance system led by the Party, invested by the state, led by the military, and participated by society. In the overall structure of the modern military governance system, different governance subjects, according to their respective division of labor, play different roles, play different roles, and jointly promote the overall improvement of military governance effectiveness. Strengthening cross-military governance is the proper meaning of comprehensively strengthening military governance, and it is the inherent requirement of consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capability. With the continuous expansion of the army's mission and tasks, higher requirements have been put forward for national defense and army construction, and it is difficult to meet the real needs by relying only on the army itself, so it is urgent to build a modern military governance system integrating the military and the land, mobilizing all the resources of the country, and integrating the local government, enterprises and public institutions, social organizations, and the general public into it, so as to effectively give full play to the advantages of the respective resources, technology, and talents, The advantages of their respective resources, technologies, talents and capabilities will be effectively utilized to jointly promote the forward development of military governance. The construction of a modern military governance system should establish a benign governance system that unifies the rich country and the strong military, balances development and security, and coordinates economy and national defense. This system can effectively enhance the national defense awareness of local departments, prompting them to do their part in national defense construction; it can promote the precise docking and seamless connection between military needs and national defense construction; and it can promote the active participation of social forces in national defense and military construction, giving full play to their respective strengths and forming an overall effect, so as to jointly push forward the maximization of the country's strategic capabilities.","The text discusses the requirement of building a modern military governance system, which should be in line with the characteristics of the times, meet the needs of reality, and lead the development trend of the governance system.

中西传统军事思想文化比较及启示 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：许三飞 责任编辑：益西拉姆 2023-11-30 06:48:29 0,中西传统军事思想文化比较及启示 ■许三飞 阅读提示 战争与文明总是相伴而生，军事传统与文化传统总是相生相成。 思想文化传统特别是军事思想文化传统一经形成，便会产生不可低估的惯性力量。“在亚历山大的胜利根源里，我们可以经常发现亚里士多德”。历史上杰出的政治家、理论家和军事家，无不被民族思想文化传统所熏陶，他们的辉煌业绩也无不闪烁着思想文化传统的光辉。 千百年来，中西思想文化的分野导致了各自社会对军事活动思考的不同侧重，以及在战争实践中的不同特色，直接影响着中西军事思想文化的内容和特色。 贵和与重争 人类在漫长的历史长河中创造了多样文明，不同文明如何交往，是任何文明都回避不了的问题。中国传统思想文化讲求和谐，强调以和为贵，追求和而不同；而西方传统思想文化讲求斗争，强调控制万物，充当世界的主宰。 “和”文化是中国人的血脉，“尚和”是中国传统军事思想文化的首要特征。我们的祖先在创造文字时，就以“止戈”为“武”。西周末期，史伯提出“和实生物，同则不继”，形成了中华文化“和而不同”的思想。《尚书·尧典》提出：“百姓昭明，协和万邦。”这之后，“协和万邦”便成为中华世界观的典范。15世纪初叶，郑和率领当时世界上最大的舰队，先后七次出使海外却秋毫无犯，这样的和平之旅在世界上是绝无仅有的。 相比之下，西方传统现实主义，作为西方传统思想文化的一个重要组成，则认为世界本质上就是充满利益的冲突与对抗。古希腊哲学家赫拉克利特认为，斗争就是正义，一切都是通过斗争而产生和消灭的。古希腊著名改革家、军事家梭伦也认为：“一个文明之所以能够成长壮大，是因为在这个文明内部孕育着强烈的帝国理想和征服欲望；而这些理想和欲望一旦消失，则整个文明必将干枯、死亡。要么征服，要么被征服，这是所有文明的生存法则。” 现在，有的西方国家打着“普世文明”的幌子，企图对世界文明进行“格式化”“标准化”“单一化”。然而，一个音符无法表达出优美的旋律，一种颜色难以描绘出多彩的画卷。文明单一化将使人类的创造力衰竭，导致人类文明僵化衰微。对此，历史学家汤因比曾说，“人类已经掌握了可以毁灭自己的高度技术文明手段，同时又处于极端对立的政治意识形态的营垒，最需要的精神就是中国文明的精髓——和谐”。“和而不同”才能推动不同文明的对话和交融，携手构建各种文明兼容并蓄的人类命运共同体。 慎战与黩武 战争与和平是人类社会的两大主题。在对待战争的基本态度上，中国传统思想文化普遍持有慎战的观念，而西方传统现实主义思想则对战争更多地倾注了歌颂与赞扬之辞。 中国古代战事频繁，众多思想家和军事家更多地把战争和人民的生死、国家的存亡紧紧联系起来，提出了慎战的思想，追求“不战而屈人之兵”的“全胜”。道家认为战争是重大祸患，老子说：“兵者，不祥之器。”《孙子兵法》开宗明义指出：“兵者，国之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也”。孙子虽然重战，但同时也反对好战。在孙子看来，“亡国不可以复存，死者不可以复生。故明君慎之，良将警之，此安国全军之道也”。他还对限制战争明确提出了三个基本原则：“非利不动，非得不用，非危不战。”商鞅也提出战争是“以战去战”，而且“兵大律在谨”。可以说，先秦诸家慎战思想不断影响着后世，逐渐成为中国军事传统的主流思想。 西方传统现实主义对战争更多地持有肯定的观点，认为人之间天然地存在竞争，战争本身是符合人性的。赫拉克利特说：“战争是万物之父，也是万物之王”。在古希腊人眼中，战争是求得荣誉、成为英雄的主要途径。在斯巴达，只要“君主们稍稍做出一点打架的信号，他们就会找到很多自愿拿起武器的人，他们唯一的愿望是取得荣誉”。此后，在漫长的历史发展中，传统现实主义思想一直影响着西方政治哲学、军事哲学的发展。及至近代，西方这种推崇战争和武力的观念并未消弭，两次世界大战给人类带来了巨大灾难。 今天，历经无数次战争，越来越多的国家认识到，弱肉强食不是人类共存之道，穷兵黩武不是人类和平之计。人类比以往任何时候都更有条件朝着和平与发展的目标迈进。但也要看到，世界并不太平，铸剑为犁仍然是人们的一个美好愿望。我们为了赢得和平，就要做好全面准备，这其中也包括战争的研究和准备工作，以期遏制、防止战争。因此，慎战不仅要保留传统的“不战而胜”的蕴意，而且要增加“不战而和”的蕴意，构建制约战争的机制。 王道与霸权 在国际交往中一直存在着“王道”与“霸道”之辩。王道的内核是仁德，霸道的内核是强权。孙中山先生曾说，东方的文化是王道，主张仁义道德；西方的文化是霸道，主张功利强权。 对战争首先进行道德评价是中华文化的传统。自汉代以来儒家思想开始占统治地位，儒家文化占据社会的主体地位，并逐步形成了内“仁”外“礼”的儒家伦理秩序，这是形成中国军事传统的文化基础。孔子曾说：“故远人不服，则修文德以来之。”孟子也说：“以力服人者，非心服也，力不赡也。以德服人者，中心悦而诚服也。”孔子和孙子也提出“有文事者必有武备”“令之以文，齐之以武”。在他们心目中，仁者无敌于天下，有德者无往而不胜，能得天下的是以德行仁的王道，而不是以力征伐的霸道。春秋时期，在战乱中崛起的五霸，把修德和振兵作为不可分割的双刃剑，来确立自己的霸主地位。行王道，就要以德胜人，以德作依托，用和平的手段，通过尚义重理、以德怀远、顺化外邦。德胜，可以使人心悦诚服，才是制胜之道的最高境界。 西方传统现实主义则认为，权力是政治的主要内容，将战争当作手段，强调以暴力取胜，武力是处理国与国之间关系的主要途径。以古希腊和古罗马为例，从开国到立国，从取得统治到巩固和维护统治，他们都始终把追求权力摆在首位，把武力扩张和铁血统治作为立国根基。在军事政策乃至国家政策上，更多靠铁血精神在社会上贯彻统治阶级的意志。斯巴达甚至在法律上规定，公民的责任和义务就是征战和战死。然而，历史和实践表明，靠武力追求的绝对霸权，也会将自己陷入困境，必然最终被武力战胜或葬送。 当下，全球治理进入了一个关键阶段，人类正面临着向何处去的历史选择。那些仍牢牢抓住冷战思维、霸权主义和强权政治不放的国家才是制造世界冲突和动荡的根源。习主席提出的构建人类命运共同体理念，是中国“内和乃求外顺，内和必致外和”的逻辑延伸，是中国作为一个负责任世界大国的价值追求。其带给人类的不是贪婪索取，而是“民胞物与”的仁爱；呈现给世界的不是征服，而是“协和万邦”的包容；带给人类的不是战争，而是和平共处、共同繁荣。这正是中华民族作为一个底蕴深厚的古老民族对全人类长远发展的智慧贡献。 道义与利益 人类对战争起源的认识与思考，经历了从直观感性状态，逐步上升到逻辑理性状态的过程。“即使是战争，也有规则。”在义利兼顾的思想天平上，中西军事传统各有侧重地贯穿着“道义”原则和“利益”原则。 “义在利中，义中有利”的义利观，是中国传统文化的重要精髓，强调重义轻利、舍利取义、以义取利、见利思义。“君子喻于义，小人喻于利”“君子爱财取之有道”，这些每个中国人都耳熟能详的道德准则，已经成为我们民族的重要文化基因。在中国古代的经史子集中，几乎没有内容直白地宣扬战争的目的是为了掠夺利益，更多的是对此类战争的指责。墨家认为，进行战争是为了道义之诛，是为了诛无道；孟子指出，进行战争是为了诛独夫，即如汤武革命；《荀子》强调，“兵者，所以禁暴除害也”。处于古代军事理论主体地位的兵家，评价战争通常也以道德为准绳，讲究用兵要考虑是否符合道德，讲究“师出有名”，强调进行战争的目的是为了维护道义。 古代西方对战争问题的思考，始终贯穿着利益之争的原则。文艺复兴时期著名的学者马基雅维利直言：“为了实现国家利益，可以不讲任何道德原则；只要达到目的，完全可以不择手段”。由于在早期实践和认识中都明显地贯穿着利益原则，欧洲中世纪以掠夺为目的的战争往往是赤裸裸的。西方历次战争也在印证着这一结论，不论战争的起因是什么，其背后都有强劲的利益驱动。 如今，一些国家利用军事优势到处干涉，打着道义的幌子干着攫取利益之事，把原本和平安宁的国家搞得支离破碎，原本清明祥和的世界搞得乌烟瘴气。战争是政治的继续，而政治既是道义、更是经济的集中表现，说到底，战争既要体现利益原则，也要体现道义原则。因此，秉持正确义利观，坚持利益与道义的辩证统一，是军事活动的根本要求，也只有这样才能避免战术上赢了、战略上却输了的怪象出现。 精神与物质 人与物，作为战争力量的基本构成，不可偏废。对此，拿破仑说，世界上只有两种力量——利剑和精神。总体上看，中国传统军事思想文化强调谋略制敌，奉行智慧加力量的逻辑，更加注重军人精神的培养，而西方传统军事思想文化重视强兵制胜，奉行力量加技术的逻辑，直至发展为技术决定论。 中国传统哲学可称为智慧哲学，中国传统文化可称为气节文化，先贤们很多时候把名声看得比生命还重要，更重视生命的社会意义及道德价值。古代兵家很早就认识到士气的重要性，在论及战争观、战略思想以及治军理念时对此常有经典论述，如“合军聚众，务在激气”“气实则斗，气夺则走”“胜在得威，败在失气”等，后来兵书中出现的“励士”“延气”“气战”等专论。这反映出古人对作战中精神因素的高度重视。韩信背水一战、项羽破釜沉舟等成为军事实践典范。毛泽东同志在评价抗美援朝战争时做过形象的阐释——敌人是“钢多气少”，而我们“钢少气多”。纵横捭阖、神机妙算的谋略智慧和视死如归、勇往直前的战斗精神，一直是我们创造战争奇迹的重要法宝。 西方文明的思维往往以自然为中心，注重运用自然科学的成果。早在伯罗奔尼撒战争中，雅典海军对战船进行了精心的设计与装备，是靠战船的高速度、机动性和冲撞力取胜的。中世纪，火器技术上的进步最终突破了封建骑士英雄主义的观念桎梏。自此后，西方更加强调一只眼盯着战争实践，一只眼盯着新技术。西方世界从1543年哥白尼出版《天体运行论》以来，科学技术便进入了狂飙突进的时期。正是在此背景下，西方的军事技术异军突起，成为殖民者掠夺和征服世界的有力工具。西方一直对接受新技术异常敏感。技术革新以及同等重要的对这种革新的迅速反应能力很快便成了西方军事文化的特性。 目前，随着科学技术飞速发展及其在军事领域中的不断应用，越来越显示出物在战争中的巨大作用。特别是当下先进科技对军事领域的影响是历史上任何时期都无法比拟的。重器轻气固然是片面的，但若矫枉过正，重气轻器同样也是片面的。战争实践告诉我们：战争中的精神力量虽然在一定程度上可以弥补武器装备的劣势，但却不是无限的。不重视武器装备，精神在战争中的作用就不能最大限度地发挥出来，在战争中要取胜就会付出更大的代价。我们在坚持“决定战争胜负的是人而不是物”的唯物史观的基础之上，必须坚持人的因素与物的因素辩证统一，把谋略智慧和战斗精神插上科技翅膀，不断提升战斗力的科技构成比例，把人的能动性与物的基础性作用在更高水平上融合，全面提高军队战斗力。 防御与进攻 进攻和防御是作战最基本的模式。古代中国非常重视民族融合与国家统一，十分强调防御的地位，既要维护自己的民族独立，又不向外扩张，而对于外来侵犯则采取积极防御的战略原则。古代西方则扩张主义盛行，主要着眼于对付外邦，更加注重进攻。 中华文明诞生于黄河流域的中原腹地，是农耕社会，自古以来就是一个多民族的生存共同体。中国传统文化强调稳定、守成、内敛，古代中国也一向认为自己是世界的中心。这些反映在军事思想上，就是珍视统一、注重防御，把安内作为军事战略之首务，把防御摆在重要地位。中国古代典籍中，多见有关防御的论述。在兵家最为繁盛的春秋战国时期，孙武、吴起、孙膑等兵学大家在论兵时从总体上多强调防御，而在论述进攻时，多从战斗和战术的角度展开。墨子提出“非攻”的政治军事观念，传世的《墨子》一书记述了墨子及其学派关于军事防御的深刻见解。中国古代的万里长城是防御思想的物化标志，反映了不同时期统治者在军事战略上所共同遵循的指导思想：既主张维护自己民族的独立又不向外扩张。著名学者费正清曾说，中国历来强调防御性战争，与欧洲帝国主义进攻理论截然不同。 古代西方具有争雄称霸的扩张传统。西方文明发源于希腊半岛，海洋文明“四海为家”的特性使其具有流动性和侵略性。当时那些国家的国防对象和战争锋芒，多是指向异域外邦。西欧各民族除自己相互征战外，还经常联合或独立对外用兵，所到之处近至地中海沿岸，远至亚非拉，处处体现了西方人崇尚武力、喜欢扩张与冒险的文化特征。例如，历史上多次爆发的亚述战争，其战火席卷了西亚和北非，以亚述王国为中心，各国展开了混战。凡是在西方古代史上拥有过辉煌，独领过风骚的国家，无不具有强烈的征服欲。伴随大国崛起的是扩张、霸权和战争，这就是西方文化中的国强必霸的理论。 当今世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，面对变乱交织的国际形势，适应国家战略利益发展的新要求，我们必须坚定不移坚持积极防御战略思想，努力建设一支与我国地位相称、与我国发展利益相适应的军事力量，增强军事战略指导的进取性和主动性，在更加广阔的空间遂行多样化军事任务，坚定捍卫国家主权、安全、发展利益，忠实践行人类命运共同体理念，积极履行大国军队国际责任，全面推进新时代国际军事合作，努力为建设持久和平、普遍安全的美好世界作贡献。,https://web.archive.org/web/20231202234951/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269993.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231201033620/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16269993.html,2023-12-03

2023-11-30 06:48:29 0,"Comparison of Chinese and Western traditional military thought and culture and inspiration ■ Xu Sanfei Reading tips War and civilization are always accompanied by each other, and military tradition and cultural tradition are always born of each other. Ideological and cultural traditions, especially military ideological and cultural traditions, once formed, will produce inertia force that cannot be underestimated. ""In the roots of Alexander's victories we can often find Aristotle"". Outstanding politicians, theorists and militarists in history have all been inculcated by the national ideological and cultural traditions, and their brilliant achievements have all shone with the glory of the ideological and cultural traditions. Over the centuries, the division between Chinese and Western thought and culture has led to the different emphasis on the thinking of military activities in their respective societies, as well as the different characteristics in the practice of war, which directly affects the content and characteristics of Chinese and Western military thought and culture. Noble Harmony and Strife Human beings have created various civilizations in the long history, and how different civilizations interact with each other is a problem that no civilization can avoid. Chinese traditional thought and culture emphasizes harmony, emphasizes the value of harmony and the pursuit of harmony and difference, while Western traditional thought and culture emphasizes struggle, emphasizes the control of all things, and acts as the master of the world. The culture of ""harmony"" is in the blood of the Chinese people, and ""harmony"" is the primary characteristic of traditional Chinese military thought and culture. When our ancestors were creating words, they used the term ""stopping the sword"" to mean ""wu"". At the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, Shi Bo put forward the idea that ""Harmony is a living thing, while homogeneity is unsustainable"", which formed the idea of ""harmony but difference"" in Chinese culture. In the Shangshu-Yao Dian, it is stated that ""The people are clear and bright, and there is harmony among all nations."" Since then, ""Harmony among all nations"" has become a model for the Chinese worldview, and in the early 15th century, Zheng He led the world's largest fleet of ships on seven overseas missions without committing a single offense, a peaceful journey unparalleled in the world. In contrast, Western traditional realism, as an important component of traditional Western thought and culture, believes that the world is essentially full of conflict and confrontation of interests. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus believed that struggle is justice, and that everything is created and destroyed through struggle. Thoreau, the famous reformer and militarist of ancient Greece, also believed that ""a civilization is able to grow and develop because within it are nurtured strong ideals of empire and desire for conquest; and once these ideals and desires have disappeared, the whole civilization will surely dry up and die. Conquer or be conquered, this is the law of survival for all civilizations."" Nowadays, under the guise of ""universal civilization"", some Western countries are trying to ""format"", ""standardize"" and ""homogenize"" world civilization. "". However, it is impossible for a single note to express a beautiful melody, and it is difficult for a single color to paint a colorful picture. The homogenization of civilization will exhaust human creativity and lead to the rigidity and decline of human civilization. In this regard, the historian Toynbee once said, ""Human beings, who have mastered the highly technological means of civilization that can destroy them, and who are at the same time in the camp of extremely antagonistic political ideologies, need the spirit of harmony, which is the essence of the Chinese civilization"". ""Harmony and difference"" is the only way to promote dialogue and integration of different civilizations, and to work together to build a community of human destiny that embraces all civilizations. War and peace are the two major themes of human society. In terms of basic attitudes toward war, traditional Chinese thought and culture generally hold the concept of war caution, while traditional Western realist thought pours more praise and glorification on war. In ancient China, there were frequent wars, and many thinkers and militarists linked war with the life and death of the people and the survival of the country, and put forward the idea of prudent warfare and the pursuit of ""total victory"" by ""giving up the army without fighting"". Taoism believes that war is a major scourge, and Lao Tzu said, ""Soldiers are ominous weapons."" Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" begins with the following statement: ""Soldiering is the most important matter of the state, the place of death and life, the way of survival and death, and it must not be ignored. Although Sun Tzu emphasized war, he was also against militancy. In Sun Tzu's view, ""a dead country can not be restored, the dead can not be restored. Therefore, the wise ruler is prudent and the good general is vigilant, which is the way to secure the country and the whole army"". He also clearly put forward three basic principles for limiting war: ""Do not move if it is not beneficial, do not use if it is not gained, and do not fight if it is not dangerous."" Shang Yang also put forward the war is ""to war to war"", and ""military law in the careful"". It can be said that the pre-Qin philosophers' idea of prudent war has continuously influenced the later generations and gradually become the mainstream idea of Chinese military tradition. Western traditional realism holds a more positive view of war, believing that competition exists naturally among people and that war itself is in line with human nature. Heraclitus said, ""War is the father of all things and the king of all things."" In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, war was the main way to seek honor and become a hero. In Sparta, as long as ""the monarchs make a little signal to fight, they will find a lot of people who voluntarily take up arms, and their only desire is to achieve honor"". Since then, in the long historical development, the traditional realist thought has been influencing the development of Western political philosophy and military philosophy. As of modern times, this Western concept of promoting war and force has not subsided, and the two world wars have brought great disasters to mankind. Today, after countless wars, more and more countries have come to realize that the law of the jungle is not the way for human beings to coexist, and that militarism is not the way for human beings to live in peace. Humanity is in a better position than ever before to move towards the goals of peace and development. However, we should also see that the world is not at peace, and that turning swords into ploughshares is still a good wish of the people. In order to win peace, we have to make comprehensive preparations, which also include the study of and preparation for war, with a view to containing and preventing it. Therefore, we should not only retain the traditional meaning of ""victory without war"", but also add the meaning of ""peace without war"", so as to build a mechanism for restraining war. King's Way vs. Hegemony The debate between ""king's way"" and ""hegemony"" has always existed in international communication. The kernel of ""the way of kings"" is benevolence and virtue, while the kernel of ""hegemony"" is power. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that the culture of the East is the Way of the King, which advocates benevolence, righteousness and morality, while the culture of the West is the Way of the Hegemon, which advocates utilitarianism and power. It is a tradition of Chinese culture to make a moral evaluation of war in the first place. Since the Han Dynasty, when Confucianism began to dominate, Confucian culture has taken over the mainstay of society and gradually formed a Confucian ethical order of internal benevolence and external propriety, which is the cultural basis for the formation of China's military tradition. Confucius once said, ""Therefore, if people from afar do not obey us, then we should cultivate our culture and virtue to come here."" Mencius also said: ""to force to serve people, not serve also, force not support also. Serving people with virtue, the center is pleased and sincere service."" Confucius and Sun Tzu also put forward ""a man of letters must be armed,"" ""to make the text, and Qi to martial arts"". In their minds, those who are benevolent are invincible, those who are virtuous are invincible, and it is the way of the king who practises benevolence with virtue, not the way of the hegemony who conquers with strength, that can win the world. During the Spring and Autumn Period, the Five Hegemons, who rose up in the midst of the war and turmoil, used the cultivation of virtue and the revitalization of the army as inseparable double-edged swords to establish their hegemonic status. To practice the Way of the King, one must win by virtue, rely on virtue, and use peaceful means to harmonize foreign states by promoting righteousness and reasoning, embracing the distant by virtue, and smoothing out the foreign states. To win by virtue is the highest state of the way of victory, as it can make people's hearts happy and sincere. Western traditional realism, on the other hand, believes that power is the main content of politics, treats war as a means, and emphasizes the use of violence to win, and force is the main way to deal with the relationship between countries. In ancient Greece and Rome, for example, from the founding of the state to the establishment of the state, from the acquisition of domination to the consolidation and maintenance of domination, they have always put the pursuit of power in the first place, and took the expansion of force and the rule of iron blood as the foundation of the state. In military policy and even state policy, they relied more on the spirit of iron blood to carry out the will of the ruling class in society. Sparta even stipulated in law that the duty and obligation of citizens was to fight and die in battle. However, history and practice have shown that absolute hegemony pursued by force of arms also puts itself in a difficult position and is bound to be eventually overcome or buried by force of arms. At the present time, global governance has entered a critical stage, and humankind is facing the historical choice of where to go. It is those countries that still hold fast to the cold war mentality, hegemony and power politics that are the root cause of creating conflicts and turmoil in the world. The concept of building a community of human destiny put forward by President Xi is a logical extension of China's principle of ""internal harmony is to seek external harmony, and internal harmony will lead to external harmony"", and it is the pursuit of China's values as a responsible world power. What it brings to mankind is not the greed of acquisition, but the benevolence of ""the people and the things they share""; what it presents to the world is not conquest, but the tolerance of ""harmony among all nations""; and what it brings to mankind is not war, but peaceful coexistence and common prosperity. This is precisely the contribution of the Chinese people, as an ancient nation with deep roots, to the long-term development of all mankind. Morality and Benefits Humanity's understanding and thinking about the origin of war has gone through a process of rising from an intuitive and perceptual state to a logical and rational one. ""Even in war, there are rules."" In the balance of righteousness and profit, the Chinese and Western military traditions have each emphasized the principles of ""morality and righteousness"" and ""profit"". The concept of ""righteousness in profit, profit in righteousness"" is an important essence of traditional Chinese culture, emphasizing the importance of righteousness over profit, sacrificing profit for righteousness, taking profit from righteousness, and thinking of righteousness in the light of profit. The moral principles of ""a gentleman's duty is to take advantage of righteousness, while a villain's duty is to take advantage of profit"" and ""a gentleman's duty is to take advantage of wealth"", which are familiar to every Chinese, have become important cultural genes of our nation. In the ancient Chinese scriptures, histories, and sagas, there is almost no content that bluntly proclaims that the purpose of war is to plunder for profit, and more often than not, it is an accusation of such wars. According to the Mohists, wars were conducted for the purpose of moral punishment, for the purpose of executing the lawless; Mencius pointed out that wars were conducted for the purpose of executing the dictator, i.e., as in the Tangwu Revolution; Xunzi emphasized that ""the military is for the purpose of forbidding violence and eliminating harm"". In the ancient military theory of the main position of the military school, the evaluation of the war is usually also based on morality as a criterion, pay attention to the use of troops to consider whether to comply with morality, pay attention to the ""teacher out of the name"", emphasizing that the purpose of the war is to maintain moral righteousness. Ancient Western thinking on the issue of war has always been permeated with the principle of the struggle for interests. Machiavelli, a famous scholar of the Renaissance, said bluntly: ""In order to realize the interests of the state, we can not speak of any moral principle; as long as we can achieve the goal, we can do whatever we have to do"". With the principle of profit evident throughout early practice and understanding, wars in medieval Europe aimed at plunder were often naked. This conclusion is borne out by the successive wars in the West, which, whatever their cause, have had a strong profit motive behind them. Nowadays, some countries utilize their military superiority to interfere everywhere, and under the guise of moral righteousness, they do things to seize benefits, shattering the originally peaceful and tranquil countries, and making the originally clear and peaceful world into a mess. War is a continuation of politics, and politics is the centralized expression of both morality and economics. In the final analysis, war should embody the principle of interests as well as the principle of morality. Therefore, upholding the correct concept of righteousness and profitability, and insisting on the dialectical unity of interests and morality are the fundamental requirements of military activities, and only in this way can we avoid the strange phenomenon of winning tactically but losing strategically. Spirit and matter, as the basic composition of the war force, cannot be neglected. In this regard, Napoleon said that there are only two kinds of power in the world - the sword and the spirit. On the whole, traditional Chinese military thought and culture emphasize strategy to control the enemy, follow the logic of wisdom plus strength, and pay more attention to the cultivation of the spirit of soldiers, while traditional Western military thought and culture emphasize the victory of the strongest soldiers, and follow the logic of strength plus technology, until it develops into technological determinism. Traditional Chinese philosophy can be called philosophy of wisdom, traditional Chinese culture can be called the culture of temperament, the sages often regarded fame as more important than life, and attached more importance to the social significance and moral value of life. Ancient military scientists recognized the importance of morale very early, in the discussion of the concept of war, strategic thinking and military philosophy, there are often classic exposition, such as ""the army gathered, it is necessary to stimulate the gas,"" ""gas is fighting, gas take away is gone,"" ""win in the Get Wei, defeat in the loss of gas"" and so on, and later appeared in the book of war ""Reed Shi"" ""Yan Qi"" ""gas war"" and other monographs. This reflects that the ancients attached great importance to the spiritual factors in combat. Han Xin's battle with the back of the water and Xiang Yu's breaking the cauldron and sinking the boat have become examples of military practice. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his evaluation of the war against the U.S. and North Korea, made a graphic interpretation - the enemy is ""more steel and less gas"", while we are ""less steel and more gas"". The tactical wisdom and the fighting spirit of being ready to die and going forward have always been the important magic weapons of our war miracle. The thinking of Western civilization is often nature-centered, focusing on the use of the results of natural science. As early as in the Peloponnesian War, the Athenian navy was carefully designed and equipped for warships, which won by the high speed, maneuverability and ramming power of warships. In the Middle Ages, technological advances in firearms finally broke through the shackles of the feudal concept of chivalric heroism. Since then, the West has placed greater emphasis on keeping one eye on the practice of warfare and the other on new technologies. Since the publication of Copernicus' Theory of the Operation of the Heavenly Bodies in 1543, science and technology have entered a period of rapid progress. It was against this background that Western military technology rose to prominence and became a powerful tool for colonizers to plunder and conquer the world. The West has always been extraordinarily sensitive to the acceptance of new technologies. Technological innovation and, equally important, the ability to react quickly to such innovation soon became the hallmark of Western military culture. At present, with the rapid development of science and technology and its continuous application in the military field, the enormous role of things in war is more and more obvious. Especially nowadays, the influence of advanced science and technology on the military field is incomparable to any other period in history. It is certainly one-sided to emphasize weapons over qi, but it is also one-sided to overdo it and emphasize qi over weapons. The practice of war tells us: although the spiritual power in war can make up for the inferiority of weapons and equipment to a certain extent, it is not unlimited. Do not pay attention to weapons and equipment, the role of the spirit in the war can not be maximized to play out in the war to win will pay a greater price. We adhere to the materialistic view of history that ""it is people, not things, that decide whether to win or lose a war"", we must adhere to the dialectical unity of the human factor and the material factor, and put the wisdom of strategy and the fighting spirit on the wings of science and technology, and constantly improve the proportion of science and technology in the fighting force, and integrate the human initiative and the fundamental role of things at a higher level, so as to comprehensively improve the combat effectiveness of the army. The army's combat power will be comprehensively improved. Defense and Offense Offense and defense are the most basic modes of combat. Ancient China attached great importance to national integration and national unity, and emphasized the position of defense, not only to safeguard its own national independence, but also to refrain from outward expansion, and to adopt the strategic principle of active defense against foreign aggression. The ancient West, on the other hand, was expansionist and focused mainly on dealing with foreign countries, paying more attention to offense. Chinese civilization was born in the hinterland of the Central Plains in the Yellow River Basin, an agrarian society, and has been a multi-ethnic community since ancient times. The traditional Chinese culture emphasized stability, conformity and introspection, and ancient China had always considered itself as the center of the world. These are reflected in the military thinking, is to cherish unity, pay attention to defense, the internal security as a military strategy of the first thing to do, put defense in an important position. Ancient Chinese canonical books, many see the discussion of defense. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, the most prosperous military school, Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Sun Bin and other military science in the military from the overall emphasis on defense, and in the discussion of the attack, more from the perspective of combat and tactics. Mozi put forward the political and military concept of ""non-attack"", and the book ""Mozi"" recorded the profound insights of Mozi and his school on military defense. The Great Wall of China is a physical symbol of the idea of defense, reflecting the guiding ideology that rulers of different periods followed in their military strategies: they advocated maintaining the independence of their own people without expanding outward. The famous scholar Fei Zhengqing once said that China has always emphasized defensive war, which is very different from the offensive theory of European imperialism. The ancient West had an expansionist tradition of competing for supremacy. Western civilization originated on the Greek Peninsula, and the maritime civilization's characteristic of being ""at home on all sides of the sea"" made it mobile and aggressive. At that time, the national defense object and the war front of those countries were mostly directed at foreign countries in foreign lands. Western European peoples in addition to their own mutual conquest, but also often joint or independent foreign military, where near the Mediterranean coast, as far as Asia, Africa and Latin America, everywhere reflects the western people advocate force, like expansion and adventure of the cultural characteristics. For example, the Assyrian War, which broke out many times in history, swept through West Asia and North Africa, with the Kingdom of Assyria as the center, the countries started a melee. Any country that has had a glorious and unique history in the ancient West has had a strong desire for conquest. The rise of great powers is accompanied by expansion, hegemony and war, which is the theory that a strong country must be hegemonic in Western culture. In the face of the great changes that have not occurred in the world in a hundred years, we must unswervingly adhere to the strategic idea of active defense, strive to build a military force that is commensurate with our status and development interests, enhance the aggressiveness and initiative of military strategic guidance, attempt diversified military missions in a wider space, and firmly defend national sovereignty, security, and development.

让双拥工作提质增效 来源：解放军报 作者：薛　侃 责任编辑：李佳琦 2023-12-26 08:42:06 0,2023年3月，习主席在出席十四届全国人大一次会议解放军和武警部队代表团全体会议时强调，要弘扬拥政爱民、拥军优属光荣传统，巩固发展新时代军政军民团结，在全社会营造关心国防、热爱国防、建设国防、保卫国防的浓厚氛围，为巩固提高一体化国家战略体系和能力、为推进强国强军汇聚强大力量。 回望1943年春节，延安宝塔山下，陕甘宁边区开展了轰轰烈烈的“拥军优属、拥政爱民”运动，地方政府召开抗属联欢会，发抗属购物优待证，群众自愿捐款捐物慰问军队达400万元之巨；陕北各部队派官兵向群众拜年，帮老乡修房砍柴、义务巡诊，被毛泽东同志誉为“旧历年节中最重要的革命工作”。这场双拥运动的广泛开展，极大地密切了军政军民关系，形成了同仇敌忾、共御外侮的生动局面。这一革命传统也作为政策制度固定下来，在继承中创新发展，成为我党我军我国人民特有的政治优势，更成为我们提升部队强大战斗力、打赢未来人民战争的重要法宝。 党的十八大以来，军地各级着眼服务党和国家工作大局、国防和军队建设全局，大力弘扬双拥光荣传统，双拥工作组织领导更加坚强有力，服务备战打仗积极有为，支援经济社会建设成效显著。现代战争不仅是军事体系之间的较量，而且集中表现为以国家整体实力为基础的体系对抗。从巩固提高一体化国家战略体系和能力的大局中思考，双拥工作仍有不断提质增效的空间，应该进一步向战聚焦创新内容形式，从而更好地助力地方经济社会发展和服务部队备战打仗。 双拥工作提质增效需要认识有高度。战争年代，双拥工作上升到战争胜败、民族存亡的高度，所以才有了抗日战争中的“陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”，解放战争中的“潮涌般的小推车和担架队”，抗美援朝战争中的“举国上下愿倾其物力财力”，也诞生了“最后一碗米送去做军粮，最后一尺布送去做军装，最后一件老棉袄盖在担架上，最后一个亲骨肉送去上战场”的民谣。它们是战争年代双拥工作特殊的作用表现，也是双拥工作承载家国情怀、忠诚担当的温度体现。新时代双拥工作要作为战略任务、摆上重要位置，让最可爱的人最可敬，让军人职业更受尊崇，做到“高看一眼、厚爱一分”，向子弟兵传递更多温暖。 双拥工作提质增效需要交往有热度。双拥工作横跨军地、涉及多方，做的都是协调对接的活，离不开持续的沟通交流。在双拥工作开展过程中，军地各级应该有事多走动，无事常联系，以交往的频度促双拥的热度，在常态互动中促进军地一家亲、军民一家情。现在，军地走访出了不少新制度新规定，对这些政策要科学解读、正确理解、认真落实。双拥工作需要带着情怀、带着责任、带着感情，在持续加温中走向深入。 双拥工作提质增效需要解忧有力度。在部队整编组建、干部交流、部署移防成为常态的当下，部队对双拥工作有更多期待，也迫切需要双拥渠道办实事、解难事。为此，首先要在服务备战打仗上加力度，不断出政策、想方法，确保经济建设和国防建设同频共振，形成部队练打仗、地方练支前、合力抓落实的生动局面。其次，要围绕官兵现实问题加力度，多送服务上门，让官兵多些幸福感和尊崇感，更好地扎根军营作奉献。同时，还要向政策优化升级上加力度，拿出“闯”的劲头、“试”的勇气，敢于突破条框、敢于先行探索，合力开创军政军民团结新局面。 （作者系上海市杨浦区人武部党委第一书记）,https://web.archive.org/web/20231227000339/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16276201.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231226023449/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16276201.html,2023-12-27 0:00:00,Let the double embrace work improve quality and efficiency Source: PLA Daily Author: Xue Kan Editor-in-chief: Li Jiaqi 2023-12-26 08:42:06 0,"In March 2023, when attending the plenary meeting of the delegation of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Armed Police Force (APF) at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), President Xi emphasized the need to carry forward the glorious traditions of supporting the government, loving the people, and supporting the military and their dependents, to consolidate and develop the unity of the military, government, and military community in the new era, and to create a strong atmosphere of caring for national defense, loving national defense, constructing national defense, and defending national defense in the whole society, so as to consolidate and improve the integrated national strategic system and capability, and to promote the strengthening of the country. The military will be strengthened to consolidate and improve the integrated national strategic system and capability, and to promote a strong nation and a strong military. Looking back to the Spring Festival in 1943, Yan'an Baota Mountain, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region carried out a vigorous ""support for the military, support for the government and love for the people"" campaign, the local government held a joint meeting of the anti-subordinate, the anti-subordinate issued a shopping card, the masses of people voluntarily donated donations to the army of 4 million yuan of sympathy; the troops of the northern Shaanxi Province to send troops to the masses to pay tribute to the New Year's Eve to help the villagers to repair the house, chopping firewood, voluntary medical rounds, and was the most important thing to do. The troops in northern Shaanxi sent officers and soldiers to pay homage to the masses, help the villagers to repair houses and chop firewood, and make voluntary medical visits, which was praised by Comrade Mao Zedong as ""the most important revolutionary work in the old calendar"". The extensive development of this double-supporting movement has greatly strengthened the relationship between the military, the government, and the people, and has created a vivid situation in which we share the same enemy and fight against foreign invasions together. This revolutionary tradition is also fixed as a policy system, innovation and development in the inheritance, and has become the unique political advantage of our Party, our army and our people, and has become an important magic weapon for us to enhance the strong combat power of our troops and win the people's war in the future. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the military at all levels focus on serving the overall situation of the Party and the country, the overall situation of national defense and military construction, vigorously carry forward the glorious tradition of double embrace, double embrace work organization and leadership is more powerful, service readiness for war and active, support for economic and social construction has been effective. Modern war is not only a competition between military systems, but also focused on the overall strength of the country based on the system confrontation. From the consolidation and improvement of integrated national strategic system and ability to think in the overall situation, double embrace work still have to continue to improve the quality of space, should be further to the war focus on innovative content form, so as to better help local economic and social development and service troops to prepare for war. Double embrace work to improve the quality of efficiency need to recognize a high degree. War years, double embrace work rises to the war victory or defeat, the height of the survival of the nation, so there is a war of resistance against Japan in the ""trap the enemy in a sea of destruction"", the liberation war in the ""tidal wave of trolleys and stretcher teams"", the war of resistance against the U.S. and aid to North Korea in the In the War of Resistance Against the United States and Aid for Korea, ""the whole country is willing to devote its material and financial resources"", and also gave birth to the ballad of ""the last bowl of rice is sent to make military food, the last foot of cloth is sent to make military uniforms, the last old cotton jacket is put on the stretcher, and the last flesh and blood is sent to the battlefield"". They are the special role of the war years double support work performance, but also double support work to carry the national sentiment, loyalty and responsibility of the temperature embodiment. The new era of double embrace work as a strategic task, on the important position, so that the most lovely people most respectable, so that the military profession is more respected, to do ""high regard, love a point"", to the sons and daughters of soldiers to pass more warmth. Double embrace work to improve the quality and effectiveness of the need to interact with the heat. Double embrace work across the military, involving many parties, do is to coordinate the docking work, can not be separated from the continuous communication. In the process of dual-support work, the military at all levels should have something more to go around, nothing often contact, to the frequency of interaction to promote dual-support heat, in the regular interaction to promote the military as a family, the military and the people as a family love. Now, the military visited a number of new systems and new provisions, these policies should be scientifically interpreted, correctly understood, and seriously implemented. Double embrace work needs to bring sentiment, with responsibility, with feelings, in the continuous heating to go deeper. Double embrace work to improve the quality of efficiency needs to solve the problem with strength. In the formation of troops integration, cadre exchanges, the deployment of defense has become the norm, the troops have more expectations of the double embrace work, but also urgently need to double embrace channels to do practical things, solve the problem. To this end, first of all, we need to strengthen the service in preparation for war, and constantly come up with policies and methods to ensure that economic construction and national defense construction resonate with each other, forming a lively situation in which the troops train for war, the local practice of supporting the front, and work together to grasp the implementation of the situation. Secondly, we should focus on the reality of the soldiers and officers to increase efforts to send more services to the door, so that the officers and soldiers more happiness and respect, better rooted in the barracks for dedication. At the same time, but also to the policy optimization and upgrading on the added strength, take out the ""breakthrough"" strength, ""try"" courage, dare to break through the box, dare to explore first, and work together to create a new situation of military-government-military solidarity. (The author is the first secretary of the Party Committee of the People's Armed Forces Department of Yangpu District, Shanghai)","President Xi Jinping emphasized the need to carry forward the traditions of ""supporting the government, loving the people, and supporting the military and their dependents"" to consolidate and develop the unity of the military, government, and military community in the new era, and create a strong atmosphere of caring for national defense, loving national defense, constructing national defense, and defending national defense in the whole society. The military will be strengthened to consolidate and improve the integrated national strategic system and capability, and to promote a strong nation and a strong military. The widely developed double-supporting movement has greatly strengthened the relationship between the military, the government, and the people, and has created a situation in which we share the same enemy and fight against foreign invasions together.

Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi Jinping, focusing on the overall situation of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, has accurately grasped the trend of the mutual agitation of ideas and cultures around the world and the profound changes in the ideological concepts of China's society, and has put forward a series of new ideas and new points of view and new assertions in the construction of culture in the new era, which has resulted in the formation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought is ambitious, far-sighted, profound, and rich in connotation, enriching and developing Marxist cultural theory, constituting the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and pointing out the direction and path to realize the goal of constructing a socialist cultural powerhouse and forging a new splendor of Chinese culture. I All epoch-making theories are the products of meeting the needs of the times. Xi Jinping's cultural thought focuses on how to continue to promote the prosperity and development of culture at the new historical starting point, and distinctly puts forward and scientifically answers the major issues of the era of building a socialist cultural powerhouse and building a modern civilization for the Chinese nation, and it is the ideological banner that guides us to forge a new glory of Chinese culture. It shows that our Party's understanding of the value and role of culture has reached a new height. ""Culture is the soul of a country and a nation. A nation thrives when its culture thrives, and a nation is strong when its culture is strong."" President Xi creatively put forward the important assertion of ""two combinations,"" especially the ""second combination,"" emphasizing that combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's outstanding traditional culture is the essential way to open up and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is the key to our success. It emphasizes that combining the basic principles of Marxism with the actual situation in China and with the excellent traditional Chinese culture is the way to open up and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is the greatest asset for our success. President Xi clearly pointed out that ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation needs to be conditioned by the development and prosperity of Chinese culture"", and emphasized that culture is a key factor in promoting the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the strategic layout of the ""Four Comprehensives"" in a coordinated manner. It emphasizes that culture is an important element in promoting the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the ""Four Comprehensives""; culture is an important fulcrum in promoting high-quality development; culture is an important factor in meeting the people's growing needs for a better life; and culture is an important source of strength in overcoming the risks and challenges on the road ahead. Based on Xi Jinping's profound grasp of the historical law of cultural inheritance and development, the inherent law of cultural development and overall social progress, and the law of socialist cultural construction with Chinese characteristics, Xi Jinping's cultural thought has given Chinese culture and civilization a new connotation of the times, and opened up a new realm for the development of Marxist cultural theory. It shows that our Party's historical and cultural self-confidence has reached a new height. President Xi clearly put forward the major proposition of firm historical and cultural self-confidence, emphasizing that ""the historical self-confidence of the Chinese Communist Party is not only the self-confidence in the achievements of the struggle, but also the self-confidence in the spirit of the struggle,"" and that ""cultural self-confidence is a more basic, broader and deeper self-confidence, and a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring power. Cultural confidence is a more basic, broader and deeper confidence, and a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring strength. President Xi profoundly expounded the great party spirit, the Chinese people's great spirit of creation, great spirit of struggle, great spirit of unity and great spirit of dreaming, as well as the five outstanding characteristics of Chinese civilization, and emphasized that ""without a high degree of cultural self-confidence and the prosperity of culture, there will be no great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"". Xi Jinping's cultural thought integrates historical logic, theoretical logic and practical logic, focuses on the integration of the essence of Marxist ideology and the essence of Chinese traditional culture, unifies the inheritance of Chinese traditional culture, the promotion of revolutionary culture and the development of advanced socialist culture, matches the stance of adhering to the Chinese culture with openness and inclusiveness, and insists on not forgetting the past, absorbing the past and looking to the future, which fully demonstrates the high degree of historical confidence and cultural self-confidence of the Party. This fully demonstrates the Party's high degree of historical and cultural self-confidence, and highlights the Party's ample strength and historical initiative to continuously forge new splendor in Chinese culture. It shows that the Party's self-consciousness in promoting cultural innovation has reached a new height. President Xi clearly put forward that ""innovation is the first driving force that leads development"" and emphasized that ""the sustainable development of civilization requires not only passing on the flame and guarding it from generation to generation, but also adapting to the times and pushing out new ideas"" and ""actively developing new cultures that reflect the requirements of the times and have the characteristics of the times, and actively developing new cultures that reflect the requirements of the times and have the characteristics of the times, We should actively develop a new culture that reflects the requirements of the times and has the characteristics of the times, and develop the modern form of Chinese civilization."" ""The Chinese people will not only contribute new development models and development paths to mankind, but also dedicate to the world the fruits of their own cultural innovations and creations."" President Xi profoundly elucidated the position and methodology of ""we must insist on observing correctness and innovation,"" emphasizing that ""for cultural construction, only by observing correctness can we not lose ourselves or our direction, and only by innovating can we grasp the times and lead the way"". Xi Jinping's cultural thought promotes the new development of culture in the spirit of keeping the right and innovation, and is committed to opening up a broader space for cultural innovation, fully stimulating the vitality of the whole nation's cultural innovation and creativity, and fostering and creating a new era of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, which injects a strong impetus for continuously forging a new splendor of Chinese culture. Second, culture establishes the heart and casts the soul, and ideology directs and navigates. Xi Jinping's cultural thought has profoundly answered the fundamental questions of what flag to raise, what path to take, what principles to adhere to, and what goals to achieve in the new era of China's cultural construction, and is a fundamental guideline for promoting the construction of a strong cultural country and forging a new glory of Chinese culture. Adhere to the road of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics. The direction determines the road, and the road determines the destiny. ""The road of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics reveals the law of cultural development in China and is the only correct road to promote the prosperity of socialist culture."" With feet on the Chinese soil, inheriting Chinese civilization, and taking the correct path of cultural development in line with China's national conditions, the Party and the people will have an incomparably broad stage, an incomparably deep historical heritage, and an incomparably strong determination to move forward. We must adhere to our own way, comprehensively strengthen the Party's leadership of propaganda and ideological and cultural work, build a strong socialist cultural power around ""raising the flag, gathering people's hearts, educating new people, promoting culture, and displaying the image"", and provide a strong ideological guarantee and a powerful spiritual force for the comprehensive construction of a modernized socialist country, and comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, favorable cultural conditions. Adhere to the guiding position of Marxism in the field of ideology. ""When ten thousand mountains are majestic, there must be a main peak."" Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology of our party and country, and is the soul of contemporary Chinese cultural development. It is necessary to hold high the great banners of Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics and build a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leadership. We must unswervingly apply the guiding position of Marxism to all areas of ideological work and all aspects of cultural construction, unremittingly arm the whole Party with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, educate the people and guide practice, consolidate and strengthen mainstream ideological and public opinion for a new era, so as to keep all the people tightly united in ideals and beliefs, values and morals, and to ensure that China's cultural construction is always moving forward in the right direction. Ensure that China's cultural construction is always moving in the right direction. Adhere to socialist core values to lead cultural construction. ""Socialist core values are a powerful force that unites people's hearts and minds and gathers their strength."" Socialist core values are rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture, fused in the great practice of our Party's long-term struggle under the leadership of the people, and are the essence of advanced socialist culture. It is necessary to take the cultivation and practice of socialist core values as a basic project to consolidate the soul and spirit, strengthen the spiritual genealogy of the CPC with the great spirit of the founding of the Party as its source, strengthen education in patriotism, collectivism and socialism, deepen the construction of socialist ideology and morality, focus on cultivating new people of the times who can take up the great responsibility of national rejuvenation, and continuously improve the people's ideological awareness, moral standard, civilization and the degree of civilization of the whole society. Civilization of society as a whole. Promote the creative transformation and innovative development of outstanding traditional Chinese culture. ""Not forgetting the past is the only way to open up the future, and inheriting well is the only way to innovate better."" Excellent traditional Chinese culture is the crystallization of the wisdom and essence of Chinese civilization, the root and soul of the Chinese nation, and the foundation for us to stand firm amidst the cultural turbulence of the world. It is necessary to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditional Chinese culture in the light of the conditions of the new era, adhere to creative transformation and innovative development, deeply excavate and expound its contemporary value, give it new connotations of the times and modern ways of expression, and better construct the Chinese spirit, Chinese values and Chinese power, so as to let the Chinese culture show its permanent charm and elegance of the times. Fully stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the entire nation. President Xi emphasized the need to work together to create a new culture for our time. Cultural innovation and creativity is the intrinsic driving force of cultural construction and development. It is necessary to stimulate the vitality of cultural innovation and creativity of the whole nation in the great practice of the new era, to create culture in the midst of practical creativity, to realize cultural progress in the midst of historical progress, to make efforts to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings and cultural industries, to continuously enhance the soft power of the national culture and the influence of the Chinese culture, to let the source of cultural innovation and creativity flow fully, and to let cultural innovation and creativity fruits continue to emerge, so that the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics always reflect the spirit of the times and lead the trend of the times. C. As culture moves forward, the generation has its own responsibility. On the way forward, we need to study and implement Xi Jinping's cultural thought in depth, better shoulder the new cultural mission, and effectively enhance the responsibility of forging a new splendor of Chinese culture. We should realize the greatness of the thought and gather the power to advance. Xi Jinping's cultural thought is thematic, complete, logical and profound, providing a powerful ideological weapon and a scientific guide to action for the work of propaganda and ideology in the new era. We need to work on comprehensive and systematic study and grasp of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, deeply understand the core meaning, spiritual essence, practical requirements of this thought, in-depth understanding of the major innovative ideas and scientific methodology contained therein, firm confidence, move forward, and work hard to unite a strong force to promote the prosperity and development of cultural undertakings. Highlight the practical application, to ensure the effectiveness of transformation. Xi Jinping's cultural thought is clear and coherent, and it defines the roadmap and mission statement for the construction of culture in the new era in terms of the combination of theory and practice. We need to find the direction, ideas and answers from Xi Jinping's cultural thought, so that it can be transformed into a firm belief and will to promote cultural self-confidence and self-improvement, into the righteousness and sharpness of adhering to the righteousness and innovation, into the ability to promote the high-quality development of cultural construction, and into the actual results of creating a new situation of propaganda, ideology and cultural work.

Strength is born from unity, and happiness comes from struggle. Over the past one hundred years, all the achievements of the Party and the people are the result of unity and struggle, and unity and struggle is the most remarkable spiritual mark of the CPC and the Chinese people. In the new era and new journey, we should firmly grasp the contemporary value and profound connotation of unity and struggle, and win greater victory and glory with closer unity and more tenacious struggle. Deeply understand the significance of creating historical greatness with unity and struggle A nation that can unite and struggle has a future, and a political party that can unite and struggle can be invincible. Unity and struggle is a valuable experience condensed by the Party and the people in the process of realizing great rejuvenation, and it is fundamental to the continuous growth of the Party's cause. Unity and struggle is the valuable experience of the Party in leading the Chinese people in their struggle for more than a hundred years. ""Those who are united at the top and bottom will win, and those who are in the same boat through thick and thin will prosper."" Ensuring the unity and solidarity of the Party is the life of the Party, and also the key to our Party's becoming a century-old party and creating a century of greatness. From the period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, ""arouse millions of workers and peasants to work with one heart,"" to the period of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, ""unite all the forces of progress,"" to the period of the War of Liberation, ""be good at uniting comrades who have different views from your own and work together""; from the period of the Socialist Revolution and the War of Socialism, the Party has been united in its unity. ""During the period of socialist revolution and construction, ""unite the whole Party and all possible forces at home and abroad"", and during the new period of reform, opening-up and socialist modernization, ""unite and look forward"", the Party has constantly taken into account changes in the situation and tasks, and united and led the people to work with one heart. Taking into account the changes in the situation and tasks, the Party has united and led the people to excel, move forward with courage and perseverance, and continue to struggle, achieving victory after victory, fundamentally changing the future destiny of the Chinese people, and creating one miracle after another: ""When people's hearts are in unison, the mountains will move"". Unity and struggle are the powerful driving force behind the historic achievements of the Party and the country. ""When the people are united, the world is invincible."" Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has comprehensively grasped the overall situation of the strategy for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great changes that have not been seen in the world for a hundred years, and united and led the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation with a rock-solid strategic determination and pioneering and innovative spirit of progress, stabilized the economy, promoted development, fought against poverty and built a well-off society, controlled epidemics and resisted catastrophes, responded to the changes in the situation, and resolved the crisis, with the help of our professionalism, and with a strong determination, and overcome the seemingly insurmountable problems of one by one. One by one, we have overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties and obstacles, and pushed the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation into an irreversible historical process. The great achievements of the new era have been made by the Party and the people through hard work and struggle. Unity and struggle is an important code for pushing the Party and the country to make historic changes and achievements, and creating great achievements of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Unity and struggle is an inevitable requirement for the realization of a comprehensively modernized socialist power. ""Entrepreneurship is difficult, and struggle leads to success."" To realize the comprehensive construction of a strong socialist modernization country and to comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese-style modernization, we need to unite the top and the bottom and struggle one after another. At present, we are in the critical period of building a socialist modernized country in a comprehensive manner, with strategic opportunities and risks and challenges coexisting, uncertainties and unpredictable factors increasing, and various ""black swans"" and ""gray rhinoceros"" events may occur at any time. The twentieth CPC National Congress on the comprehensive construction of a strong socialist modernization ""two-step"" strategic arrangements for the macro outlook, only brainstorming, collective efforts, fully stimulate the enthusiasm of the people's initiative and creativity, the construction of a strong country, national rejuvenation of the grand blueprint can be turned into a beautiful reality step by step. Embarking on a new road of ""catching up"", unity and hard work is an important guarantee for our Party to lead the people to anchor the established goals and move forward to the future, providing strong impetus and strong support for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Accurately grasp the profound connotation of unity and struggle to create historical greatness Unity is the only way to win, struggle will be successful. Unity and struggle is the valuable experience of our Party in overcoming the enemy and ruling the country, with profound theoretical logic and heavy practical roots. Adherence to the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee of unity and struggle. ""When all mountains are majestic, there must be a main peak."" The CPC is the strong leading core of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. Party leadership is the foundation and lifeline of the Party and the country, and the interests and destiny of the people of all nationalities. In the big game of the national governance system, the CPC Central Committee is the ""marshal"" sitting in the middle tent, with each of its strengths in rooks, horses, and cannons, and the overall situation of the chessboard is clear, and all the parties, organizations, ethnic groups, strata, and people from all walks of life across the country should closely unite around the CPC Central Committee to gather the courageous and invulnerable forces of progress, and move forward with one heart and one mind. The Party's leadership is the fundamental point of our country's political stability, economic development, national unity and social stability. Only by unswervingly adhering to the Party's leadership can the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities be united into ""a piece of hard steel"", so as to effectively cope with and overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the way forward, and to ensure that unity of struggle in the right direction. Adherence to the primacy of the people is the source of strength for unity and struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong once profoundly pointed out that ""the people, and the people alone, are the driving force behind the creation of world history."" For any great cause to succeed, it must find its roots in the people, gather strength from the people, and be accomplished jointly by the people. The Party has led the people to unite as one, building the ""bronze wall"" of the Red Army, forming the ""ocean"" of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, launching the victory of the Battle of Huaihai with a cart, rowing the victory of the Battle of the Crossing of the Yangtze River with a small boat, and accomplishing the achievements of the socialist revolution and construction, and starring in the history of reform and opening-up. The people of China have been the main actors in the historical drama of reform and opening up, and have created new splendor in the new era. ""Where the wisdom of the crowd is at work, nothing can be accomplished."" It is important to realize that anything that meets the fundamental interests of the greatest number of people and is embraced by the people at large will surely succeed, no matter how many difficulties remain on the road ahead. Only by placing the people in the highest position in our hearts and working wholeheartedly for the interests of the people can we win the trust and support of the people, mobilize and unite the people, and draw from them the powerful force to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, so as to win the initiative in history, and create a great cause in history. Adhering to the spirit of struggle is a practical need for unity and struggle. Our party was born at a time when the country was in internal and external trouble and the nation was in danger, and the brand of struggle was engraved on its birth. The struggle we are talking about is not a struggle for the sake of struggle, nor is it a struggle for self-interest, but a struggle for the fundamental interests of the people, in order to realize the people's aspirations for a better life, to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to know the weight of the heavy burden, hard work, and overcome the difficulties. It is precisely its difficulty that makes it all the more great. On the new journey, we are faced with a variety of struggles is not short-term but long-term, only firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle, and continue to carry forward the spirit of struggle, strengthen the struggle skills, unite all the forces that can be united, mobilize all the positive factors that can be mobilized, in order to overcome all the foreseen and unforeseen risks and challenges, and continue to open up the cause of development of new horizons. The Party and the people have created a glorious history by unity and struggle, and we must rely on unity and struggle to open up a better future. Standing on a new historical starting point, we should vigorously carry forward the spirit of unity and struggle, make concerted efforts and move forward, and promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to ride the waves and sail away. Anchor the course, oar and march, always adhere to and maintain the leadership of the party's core position. ""Six contract winds, nine states together coherent."" A country, a political party, the core of leadership is crucial. On the new journey, we should consistently strengthen our theoretical armament, always adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our guide, deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments,"" enhance the ""four consciousnesses,"" and firmly establish the ""four self-confidence"". The Party should strengthen the ""four consciousnesses"", ""four self-confidence"" and ""two safeguards"", implement the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and constantly improve its political judgment, comprehension and execution. We must play the role of the Party's leading core, implement the Party's leadership into all aspects of the overall layout of the ""Five-in-One"" and the strategic layout of the ""Four Comprehensives,"" ensure that the Party is always the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people when storms strike, and promote the development of the Party's leadership in all areas of the country. The whole party, the whole army, the whole country, people of all ethnic groups, united to move forward. To strengthen the action of self-awareness, adhere to the unity of learning, thinking and application, knowledge, faith and action, to achieve the learning and application, practice, consciously do Xi Jinping thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of firm believers and faithful practitioners, and promote the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics to continue to triumph and move forward. Unite as one, unite as one, and gather the majestic strength of the Chinese national community. ""The country is based on the people, and the gods of earth and grain are also established for the people."" It is the people's hearts that are guarded when fighting and guarding the rivers and mountains. On the new journey, we should consistently adhere to the original mission of seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, always stand, think and work with the people, insist that development is for the people, development relies on the people, and the fruits of development are to be shared by the people, and endeavor to turn the people's aspirations for a better life into reality, and to continuously enhance the people's sense of gain, happiness and security. We must continue to develop people's democracy throughout the entire process, adhere to and improve the system of people's sovereignty, continuously promote the institutionalization, standardization and proceduralization of socialist democratic politics, and better transform the advantages of the system into the efficacy of governance, so as to provide a more complete system of guarantee for the Party and the country's prosperity and long-term stability. We should continue to consolidate and develop the broadest united front, insist on seeking common ground while reserving differences, find the largest common denominator in respecting diversity, draw the largest concentric circles, and constantly forge a united consensus to gather the majestic power of unity and struggle for the new journey in the new era. Know the difficulties and rise to them, and master the sharp weapon of daring to struggle and being good at it. ""The one who does not seek easy will be successful, and the one who does not seek refuge will advance."" Our party relies on the struggle to come to today, but also inevitably rely on the struggle to win the future. On the new journey, we have to consistently carry forward the spirit of struggle, enhance the ambition of the struggle, backbone, bottom, do not believe in evil, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of pressure, with the ""yellow sands of the hundred battles through the Golden Armor, not broken the end of Lan Lan,"" the boldness and courage, dare to attack, dare to fight and win, and continue to the Party and the people's cause to move forward. To maintain the initiative in the struggle, grasp the historical characteristics of the new great struggle, seize and make good use of the historical opportunities, play a good first move, play a good initiative, with the courage to win the narrow road, take the initiative in front of the opportunity, in front of the difficulties to meet the challenges, in front of the risk of actively respond to promote the socialist cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics of the ship cutting through the waves and moving forward. To enhance the ability to fight, focus on strengthening the prevention of risk, meet the challenges, resistance to pressure, in the complexity and severity of the struggle in the storm, see the world, strengthen the sinews, long talent, in the hot practice to train dare to fight, good at fighting hard spine, iron shoulders, real skills, to take practical action to fight into the new journey, to build a new era.

Mao Zedong's military thought is a glorious chapter in Mao Zedong's thought, which creatively puts forward a set of principles and guidelines for building the people's army, the idea of people's war, and the flexible and maneuverable strategy and tactics of people's war, which has greatly enriched the treasure trove of Marxist military theories, and has guided the people's army to move forward under the Party's banner at all times. In the new era and new journey, the creative inheritance and development of Mao Zedong's military thought, we should unremittingly use the Party's innovative theories to strengthen the soul, highlighting Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, and transforming the profound understanding of the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"" into the ""two safeguards"", The military commission is highly conscious of the system of responsibility of the chairman of the military commission, forging absolute loyalty, focusing on preparation for war and fighting, and united in the struggle to realize the goal of building the army for 100 years on schedule. The military field is a glorious and wonderful field of activity in the life of Comrade Mao Zedong, and Mao Zedong's military thought is a glorious chapter in Mao Zedong's thought, which has greatly enriched the ideological treasury of Marxist military theory, and has always been a scientific guide for the development and growth of the People's Army and its ability to overcome the enemy and win the war. The wheel of history rolls forward. In today's world, the international situation is undergoing a great change not seen in a century; today's China, the Chinese nation is ushering in a bright prospect of great rejuvenation; the current military field is facing the most profound and extensive changes in mankind so far. In the new era and new journey, we deeply remember the great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, we should be guided by Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply implement Xi Jinping's Thought on Strengthening the Military, link history, the present and the future, and closely combine the great struggles with many new historical characteristics, creatively inherit and develop Mao Zedong's Military Thought, so as to coalesce the majestic force for the successive advancement of the great cause of strengthening the military, and to continuously seize the new opportunity of comprehensively advancing the modernization of national defense and the military. We will continue to win new victories in comprehensively advancing the modernization of the national defense and the army. Putting the army under the absolute leadership of the Party is the core requirement for Comrade Mao Zedong to lead the creation of a new type of people's army, and to promote the cause of strengthening the army in the new era, we must always abide by the nature and purpose of the people's army, reinforce the fundamental advantage of the Party commanding the gun, and join forces to create a brand-new chapter in building up the army by building up the army by politics, and constantly demonstrate the great power of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The Party commands the gun, which is the primary issue that Mao Zedong's military thought focuses on. Comrade Mao Zedong led the ""branch built on the company"", held the Gutian Conference, emphasized that the Communist Party members do not fight for personal military power, but to fight for the party's military power, to fight for the people's military power, the provisions of the party's command of the principle of the gun, the establishment of the principle of the political construction of the army, the army has become a fundamental guarantee that through the hardships and difficulties and do not collapse, and continue to win the war. On the new journey, we must tighten the outstanding contradictions and problems, adhere to the spirit of rectification to promote political training, adhere to the theoretical armament to gather the soul, adhere to the party organizations at all levels to make strong, through the up and down through, the implementation of a strong and tight organizational system, so that the party's leadership ""such as the body to make the arm, such as the arm to make the finger"", and strive to turn the party's political advantage into the advantage of victory. The Party's political advantage will be transformed into a winning advantage. Enriching and expanding the realization of the Party's absolute leadership of the army. Ensuring a high degree of centralization of the leadership and command of the military is a fundamental issue articulated in Mao Zedong's military thought. During the long period of revolutionary and construction practice, Comrade Mao Zedong promoted the formation of a whole set of systems under which the Party commands the army, with the system of presidential responsibility of the Military Commission at the forefront, condensing the valuable experience of Comrade Mao Zedong in building and governing the army. Since the beginning of the new era, the Party has promoted the implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and the political and military systems of socialism with Chinese characteristics have become more mature and perfect. On the new journey, we must deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", take the comprehensive and in-depth implementation of the system of responsibility of the Chairman of the Military Commission as the highest political requirement to comply with, the highest political discipline to safeguard, and resolutely follow the command of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission and President Xi. Pass on and carry forward the red gene of the people's army from generation to generation. The people's army is unrelenting, and the red gene is an intangible element of strong combat power. From the time of the Red Army, Comrade Mao Zedong focused on revolutionary and progressive political work through the army, is the source of the people's army red bloodline continues to be passed on, is the Mao Zedong military ideology contains a valuable spirit of mine. Red rivers and mountains are not easy to come by. On the new journey, it is necessary to further strengthen the lifeline status of political work, focusing on the ideals and beliefs, the principles of party spirit, the standard of combat effectiveness, the prestige of political work and other fundamental things firmly set up, and solidly promote the ""red genes from generation to generation"" project, guiding the officers and soldiers to listen to the Party and follow the Party, and always be the hero army that the Party and the people can fully rely on. Heroic army. Superior art of war guidance, Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership of the People's Army to overcome the strong enemy, from victory to a new victory of the real treasure, to promote the cause of a strong army in the new era must focus on information technology and intelligent war change, comprehensively strengthen the war and combat guidance, master the use of modern war ""swimming art"" with a view to the characteristics of the times, the development of the times planning and guidance for future wars. Guidance for future wars. Comrade Mao Zedong believes that the study and guidance of war, we must comprehensively and correctly understand the war, to explore the objective laws of war, and in accordance with this objective law to take the initiative to plan the war, prepare for war. In today's world, the elements of war and the concept of victory are undergoing major changes. We should deeply grasp the essential attributes of war, plan and manage war against the backdrop of a century of change and the goal of national rejuvenation, and pay close attention to the new developments in science and technology to empower and contribute to combat effectiveness. Knowing the enemy and knowing yourself is not a dangerous thing, we must fully grasp the interactive and object-oriented nature of the relationship between the enemy and us, and formulate flexible and flexible methods of warfare, always grasp the initiative of the war. Firmly fight political and military battles centered on seizing and maintaining the political initiative. Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out: ""politics is bloodless war, war is bloodshed politics"" ""people who do not understand politics will not fight"". He believed that if there is only a military initiative but no political initiative, it is difficult to maintain the military initiative and impossible to achieve total victory. The war we face tomorrow is essentially a political-military war. Must deeply grasp the battlefield space and time of the full range of elements of war, the full-dimensional nature of the combat field, the mobilization of the war of all the people, war control throughout the whole process, and always do to political control and traction of the military, around the political overall design and win the war. Develop people's war strategy and tactics based on the new world and national conditions and military situation. Mao Zedong's people's war ideology lies in the creative application of Marxism's theory of the people's role in history to the practice of Chinese revolutionary war and anti-aggression war, which profoundly reveals the fundamental principle that the people and the army are the basis of victory. After the founding of New China, especially in the 40 years since the reform and opening up, the international situation, the war pattern and the national and social conditions of our country and the people have undergone profound and complex changes. The development of people's war strategy and tactics in the new era, we must guard the right and innovation, focusing on the full release of the overall power of the people's war, grasp the dialectical relationship between ""change"" and ""no change"", so that the advantages of a stronger, more effective magic. To carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism that is not afraid of the strong enemy and dares to win. Our army has always been valiant and tenacious, and to the end of the bloody battle to shock the enemy's guts. Comrade Mao Zedong asked the army to ""overwhelm all enemies and never be subjugated by them"". Combining armies and gathering people together is all about energizing the people. To win the war of informationization and intelligence is still inseparable from the fighting spirit of fearlessness and fearlessness of death, we must start from the ideological point of view, strengthen the Marxist concept of war and the fundamental functions of the army, insist on wrestling the troops from the difficulty and rigor of the actual combat, and flourish the development of the spirit of the times of the strong military culture, guiding the officers and soldiers to be firmly and confidently bold and confident in the face of the enemy, and even stronger in the face of the strong. Building a modernized and consolidated national defense and a strong army is Comrade Mao Zedong's original vision of realizing and defending the interests of the people and safeguarding national security, and to advance the cause of a strong army in the new era, we must unswervingly take the road of a strong army with Chinese characteristics, accelerate the modernization of the national defense and the army, and adhere to the simultaneous and coordinated advancement of national modernization and military modernization. State modernization and military modernization are two major events that must be done for our party to be in power. At the beginning of the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong quickly put these two major events on the agenda, coordinating the relationship between national defense construction and economic construction according to changes in the situation at home and abroad. At present, China's total economic output is firmly ranked second in the world, and the construction of a consolidated national defense and a strong army that is commensurate with China's international status and in line with the interests of national security and development has become an urgent task facing China's modernization. We must adhere to the process of building a comprehensively modernized socialist power, push forward the new ""three-step"" strategy of modernizing the national defense and the military, achieve the goal of building the military for 100 years on schedule, and create a new situation of modernization of the national defense and the military. Give full play to the role of reform and innovation as a driving force and engine. Comrade Mao Zedong, the founder of our military reform, combined war fighting, reform and construction, and led our military on a unique path of reform and innovation. He fully affirmed the significance of science and technology to the modernization of national defense, and said wryly, ""We are like poor people, beggars, wearing beautiful clothes, to run outside"", and cutting-edge technology in national defense is our ""beautiful clothes"", wearing it, imperialism, hegemony, will not dare to underestimate us. The defense technology is our ""beautiful clothes"", wearing it, imperialism, hegemony will not dare to underestimate us. Currently, our military reform continues to promote in-depth, we must uphold the concept of reform is always on the road thinking, to further consolidate and expand the existing results, improve the structure of the military force, system optimization of military policies and systems, innovation of military human resources management, to accelerate the effectiveness of the reform to the troops to improve the transformation of combat effectiveness. Efforts have been made to promote high-quality development with a high level of military governance. Comrade Mao Zedong, who led our military, pioneered the ""Three Great Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention"", believed that leading soldiers is management, and that the line is ""the way of the king"" and discipline is ""the way of the hegemony"", and put forward the ""Five Unities and Four Qualities"". The ""Five Unities and Four Characteristics"" strengthened the formalization of construction, and emphasized ""replacing the discipline of the old army with the discipline of the revolutionary army"". The comprehensive strengthening of military governance in the new era is a profound change in our Party's philosophy and way of governing the military. It is necessary to further promote the rule of law and strict governance of the military, accelerate the construction of a military rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, and promote a fundamental change in the way the military is governed. At present, to promote the high-quality development of our military construction, we must actively adapt to the new requirements of the new system, and effectively solve the problems in the development of reform and innovation ideas and methods, and strive to build a modern military governance system. The unique military dialectic is Comrade Mao Zedong's ""telescope"" and ""microscope"" for observing, recognizing and guiding the war, and to promote the cause of a strong army in the new era, we must adhere to the development of Marxism to guide the development of practice, and make good use of the military to win the war. The methodology of the concept is to always stand firm on the fundamental value position of fighting and defending for the people. The people are supreme in the heart of Comrade Mao Zedong, who likens the people to ""God"", compares them to ""land"", regards them as ""eyes"", and relies on them as a ""bronze wall"". Iron wall"", this ""all for the people"" value pursuit, is Mao Zedong military thought of the original color and color. ""The military and the people are united as one person, to see who can be the enemy of the world"". We should vigorously carry forward the glorious tradition of the military loving the people and the people embracing the military, continuously develop rock-solid military-civilian relations, actively support local economic and social construction, and take practical actions to benefit the people and resolutely be the defender of the people's interests. Deepen the study and exploration of the essential laws of contradictory movements in the military field. Mao Zedong's military thought correctly deals with contradictions in war with a dialectical perspective, and has made profound and specific discussions and analyses of such basic categories as military and politics, people and weapons, and the preservation of oneself and the elimination of the enemy. In the new era and new journey, major contradictions in the military field, such as war and peace, development and security, political strategy and strategy, deterrence and actual combat, preparing for and stopping war, and observing and innovating, are facing new forms and new manifestations, so it is necessary to take the military dialectic as the ""master key"", firmly grasp the military concepts and methodology of contemporary Chinese Marxism, and adhere to the political and military concepts. We must take military dialectics as the ""master key"", firmly grasp the military concept and methodology of contemporary Chinese Marxism, adhere to political leadership, adhere to stopping the war with the military, adhere to being proactive, adhere to taking into account all factors, and adhere to the principle of ""dare to fight and win"", master the art of struggle, and emphasize the tactics of struggle, so as to open up a new horizon by relying on the tenacity of struggle. Grasp firmly the basic method of seeking truth from facts in dealing with military issues. Starting from the reality of war and seeking truth from facts is the fundamental attitude of Mao Zedong's epistemology of war. He profoundly pointed out that the key to winning many battles ""lies in the good conformity between subjectivity and objectivity"". The CPC relies on seeking truth from facts to eat, and the People's Army relies on seeking truth from facts to win battles. We must strive to master the basic skills of investigation and research, adhere to the problem-oriented, dare to touch the contradictions, the courage to overcome the difficulties. Doing what is right will make the country prosper, and doing what is right will make the army prosper. To be practical and realistic, we must really work, really fight and prepare, roll up our sleeves and work hard, a blueprint to the end, in order to realize the Party's goal of a strong army in the new era, the people's army to build a comprehensive world-class army and unremitting efforts.","The article discusses the importance of Mao Zedong's military thought in building a strong military and winning wars. It highlights the need to focus on Mao Zedong's leadership and the principles of the people's army, while also incorporating lessons from contemporary issues and continuing to innovate. The article emphasizes the importance of studying and understanding the fundamental laws of war, as well as the need to focus on the overall strength of the people's army and the political and military systems of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

新时代革命军人要以自强不息的精神奋力攀登 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：樊伟伟 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2024-01-04 06:30:51 0,以自强不息的精神奋力攀登 ■樊伟伟 ●实现梦想、达成目标要靠自强不息的精神，攻坚克难、闯关夺隘尤须力耕不辍的付出 “2023年，我们接续奋斗、砥砺前行，经历了风雨洗礼，看到了美丽风景，取得了沉甸甸的收获。”新年前夕，习主席发表二〇二四年新年贺词，深情回顾过去一年很坚实、很有力量、很见神采、很显底气的不凡历程，热切展望新的一年努力奋进的前景目标，礼赞每一个作出了不平凡贡献的奋斗者。新年贺词直抵心灵、温暖人心，铿锵话语、豪迈宣示给人启迪、催人奋进，必将激励亿万人民以自强不息的精神奋力攀登，在新征程上奋斗奋进，更好地闯出新路、干出精彩、拼出未来。 事业的伟大不仅在于目标的壮丽，更在于过程的精彩；精神的崇高不仅在于成功的激励，更在于自强的力量。时间是最忠实的记录者，也是最客观的见证者。过去一年，无论是疫情防控平稳转段、经济持续回升向好，还是现代化产业体系更加健全、粮食生产“二十连丰”；无论是东北全面振兴谱写新篇、雄安新区拔节生长，还是长江经济带活力脉动、粤港澳大湾区勇立潮头；无论是C919大飞机实现商飞、国产大型邮轮完成试航，还是神舟家族太空接力、“奋斗者”号极限深潜……这些日新月异的创新创造、可知可感的成绩成就，不是天上掉下来的，也不是自然而然得来的，而是党和人民一道自强不息、奋斗拼搏出来的。历史和实践反复证明，实现梦想、达成目标要靠自强不息的精神，攻坚克难、闯关夺隘尤须力耕不辍的付出。以自强不息的精神奋力攀登，朝着既定的目标不断进击，才能在愈进愈难的道路上不停步、不止步，在愈进愈险的征途中应变局、开新局。 干事创业犹如负重登山，不付出几番辛劳，不流下几身汗水，就不可能如愿登顶。既然我们志在顶峰，就要咬定目标不放松，决不能因胜利而骄傲、因成绩而懈怠、因困难而退缩、因风险而胆怯，真正做到过了一山再登一峰，跨过一沟再越一壑。一个人能不能以自强不息的精神奋力攀登，考验着格局胸襟、恒心毅力，检验着使命责任、担当作为，这个考验标准和检验标尺是清晰的、具体的。从实际情况看，就是有无所畏惧、一往无前的勇气，既要大胆想、大胆试、大胆闯，又要不信邪、不怕鬼、不怕压，做到在困难中承压前行、在挑战中逆势而上；有善始善终、善作善成的智慧，既要想在前、抓在前、干在前，又要能干事、善谋事、干成事，做到不达目的不罢休、不见成效不撒手；有顽强坚韧、攥指成拳的胸怀，既要观大局、察大势、抓大事，又要能吃苦、能吃亏、能忍耐，做到团结奋斗开新局、凝心聚力谱新篇。 目标越宏伟，越要以自强不息的精神来标注；前路非坦途，更应以乘势而上的奋斗来开拓。“新征程上，我们的前途一片光明，但脚下的路不会是一马平川。”实现建军一百年奋斗目标，是未来几年我军建设的中心任务，是我们向党和人民立下的军令状。当前，为实现这一目标而奋斗，已经到了最吃劲的时候。不论是深入推进人民军队党的建设，还是加强练兵备战；不论是提高发展质效，还是凝聚军地合力，都需要每名官兵激发攀登者的精气神、展现追梦人的新作为。广大官兵必须以赶考者的状态、攀登者的姿态，自觉用新方法解决新问题、用新思路谋求新发展，向实处着力、用实干说话，抓住一切有利时机，利用一切有利条件，看准了就抓紧干，能多干就多干一些，奋力跑出新时代奋斗强军加速度，打好实现建军一百年奋斗目标攻坚战。 作为新时代革命军人，以自强不息的精神奋力攀登，最现实的是要“攀”过练兵备战的阶梯、“登”上强军胜战的高峰，通过持之以恒的积淀强化战的精神、战的意志、战的能力。这就需要我们坚持不懈加强理论学习，学深悟透习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，不断提升自强不息的精神境界、固牢奋斗强军的思想根基；矢志不渝增强胜战本领，坚持打仗为要、实战为先、精武为荣，始终保持箭在弦上、引而待发的警觉，主动在任务实践中练指挥、练谋略、练胆气，在复杂条件下研究军事、研究战争、研究打仗，自觉干一行爱一行、学一项精一项，争当胜战标兵、转型先锋、技术能手；凝心聚力强化责任担当，注重向内蓄能、向外发力、向难攻坚，着眼实际尽好自己的责，对接使命干好自己的事，做到问题再难不推诿、矛盾再多不回避、困难再大不退缩，以高水平备战、高质量发展的实际成效体现担当、彰显作为。 时序轴线中，奋斗者的姿态永远不变；历史坐标上，攀登者的足迹始终清晰。一百多年前，毛泽东同志说：“我们总要努力！我们总要拼命的向前！我们黄金的世界，光华灿烂的世界，就在前面！”站在新的起点上，开启值得期待的奋斗征程，官兵肩负的使命无上光荣，只要我们始终加满油、把稳舵、鼓足劲，以自强不息的精神干事创业，以奋力攀登的姿态攻坚克难，立足自身岗位把任务一项项完成好、把工作一件件做到位，就一定能一步一个脚印把前无古人的伟大事业推向前进，在承载光荣与梦想的远征中书写荣光、成就梦想。 （作者单位：海军政治工作部）,https://web.archive.org/web/20240105000411/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16278090.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240104165324/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16278090.html,2024-01-05 0:00:00,Revolutionary soldiers in the new era should strive to climb with the spirit of self-improvement Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Fan Weiwei Responsibility: Guo Yanfei 2024-01-04 06:30:51 0,"The spirit of self-improvement to climb ■ Fan Weiwei ● to realize the dream, to reach the goal to rely on the spirit of self-improvement, to overcome the difficulties, to break through the passes, especially must be ploughed to pay ""2023, we continue to struggle, sharpened, experienced the wind and rain baptism, to see the beautiful scenery, and achieved a heavy harvest."" On the eve of the New Year, President Xi delivered a New Year's message in 2024, reviewing with deep emotion the extraordinary course of the past year, which was solid, powerful, brilliant, and remarkable, and eagerly looking forward to the prospect and goal of the new year's endeavor, and paying tribute to each and every one of the strivers who have made extraordinary contributions. The New Year's message goes straight to the heart, warms the heart, resounding words, bold declaration of enlightenment, urging people to move forward, will certainly inspire hundreds of millions of people to strive to climb with the spirit of continuous self-improvement, in the new journey to struggle, and better break into a new way, do a wonderful job, and spell out the future. The greatness of the cause lies not only in the magnificence of the goal, but also in the splendor of the process; the sublimity of the spirit lies not only in the inspiration of success, but also in the power of self-improvement. Time is the most faithful recorder, but also the most objective witness. In the past year, whether it is the epidemic prevention and control of a smooth transition, the economy continues to rebound to the good, or the modernization of the industrial system is more sound, grain production ""twenty consecutive""; whether it is the comprehensive revitalization of the Northeast to write a new chapter, Xiongan New Area, or the Yangtze River Economic Belt vitality pulsating, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Bay Area to stand up; whether it is the C919 large Whether it is the C919 aircraft commercial flight, the completion of the test voyage of large domestic cruise ships, or the Shenzhou family space relay, ""Struggle"" extreme deep diving ...... these ever-changing innovations, knowable achievements, achievements are not dropped from the sky, nor do they come naturally, but the Party and the people work together to strengthen themselves. The Party and the people together with self-improvement, struggle and struggle out. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the realization of dreams and the achievement of goals depend on the spirit of continuous self-improvement, and the dedication of continuous effort is especially necessary for overcoming difficulties and breaking through passes. With the spirit of self-improvement to climb, towards the established goal of continuous attack, in order to get more and more difficult on the road without stopping, do not stop, in more and more dangerous journey should be changed, open a new bureau. Officers and entrepreneurs are like heavy mountaineering, do not pay a few times hard work, do not shed a few body sweat, it is impossible to reach the top as desired. Since we aspire to the summit, we must bite the target not to relax, must not be proud of the victory, because of the achievements and slack, because of the difficulties and retreat, because of the risk and timid, really over a mountain and then climb a peak, across a ditch and then over a ravine. A person can not strive to climb with the spirit of self-improvement, testing the pattern of broad-mindedness, perseverance, testing the mission and responsibility, take on the role, the test standard and test scale is clear and specific. From a practical point of view, it is fearless and courageous, not only to boldly think, boldly try, boldly break through, but also to not believe in evil, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of pressure, to do in the difficulties of the pressure to move forward, in the challenges against the trend of the upward; have a good start, good end, good work, good wisdom, not only to think in front, grasp in front, do in front, but also to be able to officers, good planning, do things, do not reach the goal not to give up, not see the results of the not to let go! ; tenacious and tough, clenched fingers into a fist of the chest, not only to look at the big picture, check the situation, grasp the big picture, but also to be able to suffer, be able to suffer, be able to endure, to achieve unity and struggle to open up new horizons, unity of purpose to create a new chapter. The more ambitious the goal, the more to the spirit of self-improvement to mark; the road ahead is not a straight road, more should take advantage of the momentum of the struggle to open up. ""On the new journey, our future is bright, but the road under our feet will not be smooth."" Achieving the goal of 100 years of military construction is the central task of our military construction in the next few years, and it is the military order we set to the Party and the people. At present, the struggle to realize this goal has come to the most strenuous time. Whether it is to further promote the people's army party building, or to strengthen the training and preparation for war; whether it is to improve the quality and efficiency of development, or to cohesion of the military and the joint forces, we need every officer and soldier to stimulate the spirit of the climbers, to show the dreamer's new behavior. The majority of officers and soldiers must catch up with the state of the examiner, the posture of the climber, consciously use new methods to solve new problems, use new ideas to seek new development, to the actual place of effort, with the actual work to speak, to seize all favorable opportunities, to take advantage of all favorable conditions, see the right to seize the opportunity to do, can do more to do more, and strive to run out of the new era of struggle to strengthen the army to accelerate the fight to achieve the goal of building the army one hundred years of the battle. As a revolutionary soldier in the new era, the spirit of self-improvement to climb, the most realistic is to ""climb"" over the ladder of military training and preparation, ""climb"" on the peak of the strong army to win the war, through the persistent accumulation of strengthening the spirit of war, the will to fight, the ability to fight. This requires us to unremittingly strengthen theoretical study, learn and comprehend Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, constantly enhance the spirit of self-improvement, and consolidate the ideological foundation of the struggle to strengthen the army; unswervingly enhance the ability to win the war, adhere to the war as the main point, the actual combat as the first, and the martial arts as the honor, always keep the arrow in the string, and ready to be issued, take the initiative to practice the task practice command, practice strategy, and practice the courage, and study military under complex conditions, study the war, and study the war, so as to strengthen our ability to win the war. Under the complex conditions of research military, research war, research war, consciously do a line of love, learn a fine one, and strive to be the standard bearer of victory, transformation pioneers, technical masters; concentrate on strengthening the responsibility to bear, focusing on inward energy, outward force, to the difficult to attack, focus on the actual to do their own responsibility, docking mission to do their own thing, to do the problem is difficult to do without shirking, contradictions are not to avoid, the difficulties are not to shrink, to High level of preparation, high-quality development of the actual results of the embodiment of commitment, show as. In the chronological axis, the gesture of the struggler is always the same; on the historical coordinates, the footprints of the climber are always clear. More than a hundred years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said: ""We always have to work hard! We must always strive forward! The world of our gold, the world of light and splendor, is just ahead!"" Standing on a new starting point, open a worthy journey of struggle, officers and soldiers shoulder the mission of supreme honor, as long as we are always full of oil, steady rudder, drum full of energy, with the spirit of self-improvement officers and entrepreneurs, in order to climb up the attitude to overcome the difficulties, based on their own positions to the task of completing the task one item at a time, one job at a time, we will certainly be able to step by step to the great cause of the unprecedented to move forward in the carrying The glory and dreams of the expedition to write glory, achievement of dreams.

繁荣发展支撑打赢制胜的强军文化 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：陈阵 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2024-01-10 07:13:06 0,繁荣发展支撑打赢制胜的强军文化 ■陈　阵 强军文化是人民军队战无不胜、攻无不克，不断发展壮大的内在保证，是滋养官兵的精神沃土，是提高部队战斗力的重要因素。党的二十大报告强调要“繁荣发展强军文化，强化战斗精神培育”。深入学习贯彻习近平文化思想，对人民军队而言，就是要繁荣发展强军文化。通过文化的教化和熏陶，培育广大官兵敢打必胜的战斗血性、英勇顽强的战斗作风，以先进文化砥砺克敌制胜精神，为能打仗、打胜仗提供精神动力，真正让强军文化指向打赢、服务打赢、支撑打赢。 一 全面加强练兵备战，提高人民军队打赢能力，必须重视发挥强军文化为战育人、助力强军的价值功能。繁荣发展支撑打赢制胜的强军文化，既是历史传承、时代所需，也是强军事业的召唤。 赓续我军文化传统的根本指向。文化是一个民族昌盛的根脉，也是一支军队强大的重要支撑。80多年前，毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”我军在长期革命、建设和改革实践中，用鲜血和生命熔铸了胜利的“文化基因”、英雄的“文化血脉”，滋养了一代又一代官兵。一切为了胜利的胜战文化，蕴含着强大的血性基因，彰显着鲜明的打赢指向。新时代新征程，从我军文化传统中萃取精华、汲取能量，关键要着力擦亮官兵战斗精神的尖刀利剑，持续增强官兵的向战为战意识，不断强化闻战则喜、英勇顽强、敢打必胜的尚武精神。 适应战争形态演变的必然选择。世界新军事革命正推动战争形态向具有智能化特征的信息化战争加速演进，呈现出技术形态信息化、组织形态体系化、武器装备数字化等特征。战争形态的演变，必然引发军事文化形态的重塑。从机械化战争到信息化、智能化战争，从“大兵团”作战、“大纵深”突击，到“非对称作战”“非线式作战”“一体化联合作战”，再到“多域精确战”“认知域作战”，战争制胜机理的演变，推动军事文化形态相应随之改变。新征程上，我军推进机械化信息化智能化融合发展，既要加速武器装备的迭代更新，更要积极推进军事文化转型发展，从军事理论、战略战术、战斗精神等方面塑造和体现时代特质，打造与时代发展相适应、与技术进步相契合的新时代支撑打赢制胜的强军文化。 繁荣发展强军文化的本质要求。强军文化姓军为战的根本职能，决定了打造强军文化的根本目的就是为能打仗、打胜仗提供精神动力。强军文化具有极强的渗透性、持久性，其所蕴含的忠诚品质和斗争意志，锻造着人民军队的精气神，培育着人民军队无坚不摧的战斗力。党的十八大以来，人民军队浴火重生、转型重塑，全军部队以能打仗、打胜仗为根本着眼点，把繁荣发展强军文化作为催生战斗力的有力举措，与战斗力生成紧密结合在一起，与军队主责主业紧密结合在一起，不断提升强军文化对战斗力的贡献率，充分彰显了强军文化在练兵备战中的战斗功能。 二 繁荣发展支撑打赢制胜的强军文化，必须以习近平强军思想为指导，把准主脉、突出重点，着力培塑以战斗文化、联合文化、部队特色文化等为主体内容的强军文化体系。 培育能打胜仗的战斗文化。战斗文化反映强军文化的内在本质，决定着强军文化的价值定位和价值取向。战斗文化是历经军事斗争实践锤炼、淘洗、积淀形成的血性文化，具有深厚的文化底蕴、强烈的战斗特性和鲜明的时代特征，其价值功能主要表现为强化打仗意识、提升作战本领、砥砺战斗精神，是战斗力的重要构成要素，是强军文化体系的主体，是人民军队打赢制胜的重要法宝。培育战斗文化，要着力强化官兵当兵打仗、带兵打仗、练兵打仗的责任担当，“一不怕苦、二不怕死”的战斗精神和英勇顽强、敢打必胜的战斗品质，切实把战斗力标准作为繁荣发展强军文化的基本着力点和根本落脚点，作为检验强军文化建设质效的根本尺度。 培育联合制胜的联合文化。现代战争无战不联、无联不胜，基本作战样式是一体化联合作战。联合文化是基于打赢现代战争所具备的联合知识体系、价值观念、思维方式和行为规范的总和，广泛渗透于联合作战体制编制、力量结构、行为准则和模式之中。它就像看不见的手，有力推动着联合作战体系从“形联”到“神联”，从“芯联芯”到“心连心”。培育联合文化，要依托任务牵引和联演联训，铸牢官兵听党指挥的政治灵魂，培塑联合制胜的作战理念，完善联合作战的知识体系，锤炼一体联动的思维方式，培育共同的情感和价值，强固稳定的集体心理认同，凝聚牢不可破的打赢意志。 培育丰富多彩的部队特色文化。一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。我军在军事实践中形成了各具特色的军兵种文化，有陆军的“装甲铁流”文化、“炮兵战神”文化、“陆航战鹰”文化，海军的“深蓝文化”，空军的“天鹰”“天梯”“天箭”文化，火箭军的“砺剑文化”“长缨文化”，等等。一朵朵军兵种文化的瑰丽之花，既构成了独特的精神标识，又成为部队战斗力提升的“倍增器”。打造具有鲜明特色、底蕴深厚的军兵种文化，与培育联合文化并不矛盾。军兵种文化支撑联合文化，联合文化实现了军兵种文化的有机融合，军兵种特色文化的根扎得越深，联合文化战斗性就越强，就越有战斗力。与此同时，要大力开展多姿多彩的军营文化活动，以特色文化铸军魂、聚兵心、提士气，着力形成人人都有舞台的生动活泼局面，更有效地发挥以文育人、以文化人、以文资战作用。 三 繁荣发展新时代强军文化，必须坚持把服务打赢作为根本指向，坚定历史自信，赓续胜战基因；坚持向战为战，强化战斗属性；多措并举，融合创新，营造尚武精武的浓厚氛围，切实用强军文化催生战斗力。 厚植新时代革命军人的胜战基因。文化在本质上是一种精神承载，我军在90多年的奋斗历程中锻造形成的敢打必胜的战斗文化，铸就了克敌制胜、赢得未来的特有优势。新征程上，我们要大力弘扬人民军队光荣传统，宣传先进英模、战斗英雄典型事迹，引导官兵从革命精神中汲取营养，从辉煌战史中汲取斗志，从战斗荣誉中汲取力量，让人民军队的胜战基因薪火相传。当前，世界大变局加速演进，世界之变、时代之变、历史之变正以前所未有的方式展开。要教育引导广大官兵不畏强敌，认清坚持党对军队绝对领导是我军能打胜仗的根本保证，认清人民战争的整体威力是我军克敌制胜的法宝，把战斗精神与科学精神结合起来，赓续我军优良传统，牢固树立立足现有装备打赢制胜的信心决心。 提升强军文化建设的战斗指数。习主席指出：“要结合各部队传统和任务特点，加强军事文化建设，打造强军文化，培养部队大无畏的英雄气概和英勇顽强的战斗作风。”要把军事文化工作根本指向归正到支撑能打仗、打胜仗上。深入挖掘革命历史题材，突出现实军事题材创作，始终以高尚的精神塑造人、以优秀的作品鼓舞人。常态安排文艺轻骑队、战地宣传队、战地摄影队等进寒区、入戈壁、上高原、下海防、走边关、进班排，为练兵备战、矢志打赢温暖兵心、鼓舞士气、激发斗志。坚持向文化要战斗力，推动强军文化建设重心从营区延伸至战场、从平时拓展到战时。组织战时文化工作演练，探索战时文化工作的内容、时机和方式手段，为提高部队战斗力提供重要支撑。 增强军营文化氛围的兵味战味。打造强军文化，一项重要任务是营造兵味战味浓厚的环境氛围，使官兵时时受到熏陶，在潜移默化中培养战斗意志、砥砺战斗品格。浓厚练兵打仗氛围，把战斗旗帜扬起来、战斗口号喊起来、强军战歌唱起来，设置文化灯箱、战斗标语、英模雕塑等，修建反映部队战史战例、革命精神的文化场所，不断强化广大官兵战争意识、战备观念、战斗精神。抓好群众性文化活动，开设强军文化讲座，举办强军文化论坛，组织官兵讲战斗故事、读战斗文化书籍，广泛开展刺杀格斗训练和比武竞赛活动，激发官兵敢战能战善战的血性胆气。创新方式方法，将时代元素、科学技术与文化艺术结合起来，运用VR、AR、MR等科技手段，打造战场文化模拟室等，让官兵“身临其境”感受战场氛围、锤炼打赢能力。 （作者单位：陆军党的创新理论研究中心）,https://web.archive.org/web/20240111000015/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16279540.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240110092245/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16279540.html,2024-01-11 0:00:00,Prosperous Development of Strong Military Culture to Support Winning Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Chen Zhen Editor-in-Chief: Guo Yanfei 2024-01-10 07:13:06 0,"Prosperous development of strong military culture to support winning ■ Chen Zhen strong military culture is the people's army invincible, invincible, the internal guarantee of continuous development and growth, is the nourishment of officers and soldiers of the spirit of fertile ground, is to improve the combat effectiveness of the troops an important factor. The report of the 20th Party Congress emphasized the need to ""prosper and develop a strong military culture and strengthen the cultivation of the fighting spirit"". For the People's Army, in-depth study and implementation of Xi Jinping's cultural thinking means the prosperous development of a strong military culture. Through cultural indoctrination and inculcation, cultivate the majority of officers and soldiers dare to fight and win the combat blood, heroic and tenacious fighting style, advanced culture to sharpen the spirit of victory, to be able to fight and win the war to provide the spiritual impetus to really let the strong military culture point to win, service win, support win. A comprehensive strengthening of military training and preparation for war, to improve the people's army's ability to win, we must pay attention to play a strong military culture for the war educate people, help to strengthen the value of the function of the army. The prosperity and development of strong military culture to support the win-win situation is not only a historical inheritance, but also a call for the cause of the strong military. The fundamental point of continuing our military cultural tradition. Culture is the root of a nation's prosperity, but also an important support for a strong army. 80 years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Yan'an Literature and Art Symposium, ""We have to rely on the army with a gun in its hand in order to defeat the enemy. But it is not enough to have such an army; we must also have an army of culture, which is an army indispensable for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy."" In the long-term practice of revolution, construction and reform, our army has used blood and life to forge the ""cultural genes"" of victory and the ""cultural bloodline"" of heroes, nourishing generations of officers and soldiers. All for the sake of victory of the winning culture, contains a strong blood gene, highlighting the distinctive winning point. A new era and a new journey, from the essence of our military culture and tradition, draw energy, the key to focus on polishing the fighting spirit of the officers and soldiers of the sharp sword, and continue to enhance the officers and soldiers of the war for the war consciousness, and constantly strengthen the spirit of martial arts to hear the war is happy, brave and tenacious, and dare to fight and win. Adapt to the inevitable choice of the evolution of war forms. The world's new military revolution is promoting the war form to the intelligent characteristics of information technology war accelerated evolution, showing a technical form of information technology, organizational form of systematic, digital weapons and equipment features. The evolution of the war form will inevitably lead to the remodeling of military culture. From mechanized war to informatization, intelligent war, from ""large regiment"" combat, ""great depth"" assault, to ""asymmetric combat"", ""non-linear From ""large corps"" operations and ""large deep"" raids, to ""asymmetric operations"", ""non-linear operations"", ""integrated joint operations"", to ""multi-domain precision warfare"" and ""cognitive domain operations"", the evolution of the mechanism for winning wars has pushed the military culture to change accordingly. The evolution of the mechanism of winning war has driven the military culture to change accordingly. On the new journey, our army promotes the integration and development of mechanization, informatization and intelligence, not only to accelerate the iterative updating of weapons and equipment, but also to actively promote the transformation and development of military culture, shaping and embodying the qualities of the times in terms of military theories, strategies and tactics, and the spirit of combat, so as to create a strong military culture that is in line with the development of the times and compatible with technological advances in support of winning and winning in the new era. The essential requirement for the prosperity and development of strong military culture. The fundamental function of strong military culture is to provide spiritual impetus for the ability to fight and win wars. Strong military culture has a strong permeability and durability, and the quality of loyalty and will to fight contained in it forges the spirit of the people's army and fosters its invulnerable combat power. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the people's army has been reborn, transformed and reshaped, and the whole army has taken the ability to fight and win battles as the fundamental focus, and has taken the prosperity and development of a strong army culture as a powerful initiative for generating combat power, closely integrating it with the generation of combat power and the army's main responsibility and main business, and constantly improving the rate of contribution of a strong army culture to combat power, which has fully demonstrated the function of a strong army culture in the practice of military preparation for war. Secondly, to prosper and develop a strong military culture that supports winning, we must be guided by Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, focus on the main vein, highlight the key points, and focus on shaping a strong military culture system with the main content of the combat culture, the joint culture, and the culture of the characteristics of the troops. Cultivate a combat culture that can win battles. Combat culture reflects the intrinsic nature of strong military culture and determines the value orientation and value orientation of strong military culture. Combat culture is through the military struggle practice refining, scrubbing, precipitation formation of blood culture, has a deep cultural heritage, strong combat characteristics and distinctive characteristics of the times, its value function is mainly manifested in the strengthening of the awareness of the war, to enhance combat skills, sharpening the spirit of combat, is an important constituent element of combat effectiveness, is the main body of the strong military culture system, is the People's Army win win an important magic weapon. Cultivate combat culture, we should focus on strengthening the officers and soldiers to fight in war, lead the troops to fight in war, practice the responsibility to fight in war, ""not afraid of pain, not afraid of death"" fighting spirit and valor and tenacity, dare to fight and win the battle quality, and effectively take the standard of combat effectiveness as the basic focus of the development of a strong military culture and the fundamental landing point, as a fundamental yardstick to test the effectiveness of the construction of a strong military culture. The standard of combat effectiveness is taken as the basic point of focus and the fundamental starting point for the prosperous development of strong military culture, and as the fundamental yardstick for testing the quality and effectiveness of strong military culture. Cultivate a joint culture of joint victory. Modern war is not won without union, and the basic combat style is integrated joint operations. The joint culture is based on the joint knowledge system, values, ways of thinking and behavioral norms for winning modern wars, and is widely penetrated in the joint combat system, force structure, code of conduct and mode. It is like an invisible hand, vigorously promoting the joint operation system from ""form association"" to ""divine association"", and from ""core association"" to ""heart to heart"". ""The United States is the only country in the world that has a joint culture. Cultivate a joint culture, relying on mission traction and joint exercises and training, casting the political soul of the officers and men to listen to the Party's command, shaping the operational concept of joint victory, perfecting the knowledge system of joint operations, refining the way of thinking of the one linkage, fostering a common emotion and value, reinforcing a stable collective psychological identity, and cohesion of the unbreakable will to win. Cultivate a rich and colorful culture of troop characteristics. A flower alone is not spring, a hundred flowers bloom in the spring garden. Our military practice in the military formed a distinctive military culture, the army's ""armored iron flow"" culture, ""artillery God of War"" culture, ""land navigation eagle"" culture, the Navy's ""deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"", ""the deep blue culture"". ""Deep Blue Culture"", the Air Force's ""Sky Eagle"", ""Sky Ladder"", ""Sky Arrow"" culture, the Rocket Force's ""Sword Sharpening Culture"", and the Rocket Force's ""Sword Sharpening Culture"". ""sword culture"" ""tassel culture"", and so on. A military service culture of the magnificent flower, not only constitute a unique spiritual identity, but also become a force combat effectiveness to enhance the ""multiplier"". To create a distinctive characteristics, the deep-rooted military service culture, and cultivate joint culture is not contradictory. Military service culture to support the joint culture, joint culture to realize the organic integration of military service culture, military service characteristics of the deeper the roots of culture, joint culture, the stronger the combat, the more combat power. At the same time, we should vigorously carry out colorful military cultural activities, with special cultural casting military soul, gathering soldiers, morale, and strive to form a lively situation in which everyone has a stage, and more effectively play the role of culture to educate people, culture, culture, culture and war. Three prosperous development of a new era of strong military culture, must adhere to the service of winning as the fundamental point, firm historical confidence, continue to win the war gene; adhere to the war for the war, strengthen the combat attributes; multi-pronged measures, integration and innovation, to create a strong atmosphere of martial arts and martial arts, and effectively use the culture of the strong military to generate combat effectiveness. Thickly plant the new era of revolutionary soldiers to win the war gene. Culture is essentially a spirit bearing, our army in more than 90 years of struggle forging the formation of dare to fight and win the battle culture, casting the unique advantages of victory over the enemy, win the future. On the new journey, we should vigorously carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, publicize advanced models and typical deeds of war heroes, guide officers and soldiers to draw nourishment from the spirit of the revolution, draw fighting spirit from the glorious history of battles, and draw strength from the honor of battles, so as to make the people's army's winning gene pass on from one generation to the next. At present, the world's big changes are accelerating, the world's change, the change of the times, the change of history is unfolding in an unprecedented way. To educate and guide the majority of officers and soldiers not to fear the strong enemy, recognize that adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party to the army is the fundamental guarantee that our army can win the war, recognize the overall power of the people's war is the treasure of our army to overcome the enemy, the spirit of combat combined with the spirit of science, to continue the fine traditions of the army, and firmly establish a firm basis in the existing equipment to win the victory of the confidence and determination. Enhance the strong military culture construction of the combat index. President Xi pointed out that ""we should combine the traditional and mission characteristics of each unit to strengthen the construction of military culture, to create a strong military culture, and to cultivate the fearless heroism of the troops and the brave and tenacious fighting style."" The fundamental point of military cultural work should be normalized to support the ability to fight and win battles.

""On the way forward, wind and rain are the norm."" ""I am deeply moved by everyone's fearlessness of the wind and rain, watchfulness and support, facing challenges head on and overcoming difficulties. Hard-working farmers, hard-working workers, entrepreneurs who dare to break through, soldiers defending the country, people from all walks of life are sweating it out, and every ordinary person has made extraordinary contributions!"" In his 2004 New Year's message, President Xi fondly recounted the stories of the masses of people who have weathered the storms and made unremitting progress over the past year, and praised each and every ordinary person who has sweated and struggled. Warm words to inspire us to strengthen the ideals and beliefs, boost confidence in fighting, and encourage us to go forward through thick and thin, embrace the dream and achieve the future. Rain or shine, everyone is a walker. Life, everyone is in their own way to contribute to the country and society, are using hard sweat and hard work to write an extraordinary story. I still remember the K396 train stranded in northern China during the torrential rains and floods, the crew, passengers, rescuers united to protect the peace; I still remember the Chengdu Universiade and Hangzhou Asian Games, the athletes rose to the challenge, broke through, the pursuit of excellence, and the courage to create a good record; I still remember the strong rains, snow, and strong cold weather, the majority of the masses of cadres and workers together to clear the snow and inspect the pipeline in the rain, snow, and ice weather to stand firm. Still remember that after the 6.2 magnitude earthquake in Jieshishan County, Gansu, the people's sons and daughters of the army, emergency rescue workers, thousands of volunteers from all directions to come to the aid of the people, the people of the city, earthquake relief ...... Looking back at the past 2023, we work together to resolve crises, barge through difficult situations, strain the situation, ordinary people with The ordinary people used their hands to gather extraordinary strength, vividly explaining what is the wind and rain, unity and struggle. On the road of life, wind and rain is the norm, rain and wind is the mentality, rain and wind is the state of affairs, and constantly move forward, and eventually realize the goal. Rain or shine, move forward, we must be determined to advance confidence. President Xi pointed out: ""when there is no difficulty? One by one, year after year, year after year, the Chinese nation for more than 5,000 years are so. Climbing over the hurdles, the key is to boost confidence."" Confidence is a positive and optimistic state of mind, can stimulate people's endogenous motivation and deep potential, cohesion of the spiritual quality of progress. Countless facts tell us that any difficulties and twists and turns can not stop the wheel of history, in the face of the road ahead of the dangers of the shoal, climbing the arduous, difficult to break through the barrier, we must be firm confidence, invigorate the spirit, unity and struggle, and drum up enough to defy the difficulties and dangers, overcome the difficulties of the courage to stimulate upward mobility, the sharpness of the tide in order to stand up to the tide, cutting through the waves. For the majority of officers and soldiers, in the great journey of realizing the Chinese dream of a strong army, no matter how much wind and rain, how many trials and tribulations, can not lose confidence, hesitation and retreat. The more difficult the moment, the more confidence, as long as always carry the faith of victory, sure footsteps, will be able to usher in the dawn of victory. Rain or shine, move forward, to dare to face the challenges. On the road ahead, difficulties and challenges always exist, the more we go forward, the more we climb up, the more there will be more ""Loushan Pass"" ""Lazikou"" stretched across the front. If you can not face the challenges, break through the barriers, but fearful, avoiding contradictions, then, in the training and preparation for war it is not possible to do from the strict from the difficult, real, in the scientific research in the research is not possible to seize the first opportunity to take the initiative in the road ahead it is not possible to gnaw down the hard bones, break through the dangerous shoals. For the majority of officers and soldiers, in order to achieve the goal of one hundred years of the army on schedule, we must have the courage and determination to face the challenges, not to shirk in the face of difficulties, not to escape, not to cower in the face of risks, not to dodge, the courage to pick the heaviest burdens, and the courage to take the hot potatoes, and consciously put the mission and responsibility of the strong army in the heart, on the shoulder, and embodied the loyalty to the Party to overcome the difficulties of the action. Rain or shine, move forward, to enhance the ability to win. If you can't win on the battlefield, everything is equal to zero. All the work of the army to be able to fight, win the war focus, comprehensively improve the ability to win, for the army to effectively fulfill the mission and task of the new era, effectively safeguard the interests of the country has great practical significance. At the beginning of the new year, the whole army officers and soldiers moved like the wind, focusing on the preparation for war, from the desert Gobi to the coastal line, from the snowy plateau to the mountainous dense forests, to ""always ready"" combat posture into the actual combat military training, set off a new year of practice and preparation for war fever. This is not only to enhance the ability to win the reality of the requirements, but also the majority of officers and soldiers to fulfill the mission of the action of self-consciousness. We should always put the preparation for war in the central position, always put the combat effectiveness standard, combat requirements throughout the whole process of military construction in all areas, focusing on war planning, research, war, war, war preparation to build and grasp the war. The majority of officers and soldiers to carry forward the ""not afraid of pain, not afraid of death"" fighting spirit, adhere to how the war how to fight soldiers how to practice, what is needed to fight the war on what to practice hard, do hard training, scientific training, safety training, practice strong command ability, practice fine fighting skills, practice hard fighting style, enhance the enemy to win the actual combat atmosphere. Rain or shine, move forward, to be buried in hard work and practical work. The road is simple, practical work is important. Burying the head to do hard work is the fine tradition of our party and our army, the old revolutionaries rely on this spirit of burying the head to do hard work, unite and lead the whole party, the whole army, the whole country of all ethnic groups to write a brilliant chapter of career development. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, President Xi has repeatedly emphasized the need to advocate practical work, pay close attention to implementation, pointing out that ""we rely on practical work to create a brilliant past, but also to rely on practical work to create a better future"". At present, less than four years remain to realize the goal of one hundred years of the army, the more arduous the task, the more we must work hard; the more time is short, the more we must work hard and fast. On the new journey, the majority of officers and soldiers should be down-to-earth, hard work, not in empty thoughts, not overly ambitious, personal ideals into the practice of strong military; must be practical and good learning, respect for the actuality, do not go against the law, not blindly do not do, to complete the phased objectives and tasks; to be pragmatic, focus on practical results, do not do superficial articles, do not play the flowery fist fist, and solidly push forward the cause of a strong army.","The article emphasizes that in the struggle for the goal, one must persistently move forward regardless of the wind and rain. The author cites various examples of ordinary individuals overcoming obstacles and contributing to society, demonstrating the strength of perseverance and unity. Confidence, facing challenges head-on, and enhancing one's abilities to win are key attributes that can lead to success. Furthermore, supporting practical work and being buried in hard work are considered crucial in the journey towards achieving the goal."

以大党独有优势破解大党独有难题 来源：光明日报 作者：王炳林 责任编辑：于雅倩 2024-01-11 10:10:30 0,习近平总书记在党的二十大报告中指出：“我们党作为世界上最大的马克思主义执政党，要始终赢得人民拥护、巩固长期执政地位，必须时刻保持解决大党独有难题的清醒和坚定。”坚持问题导向，认识到存在独有难题，表明我们党具有深沉的忧患意识和历史责任感；坚持守正创新，相信能够破解难题，表明我们党具有强烈的责任担当和历史主动精神。大有大的样子，也有大的难处。大党独有难题集中体现为“六个如何始终”，即如何始终不忘初心、牢记使命，如何始终统一思想、统一意志、统一行动，如何始终具备强大的执政能力和领导水平，如何始终保持干事创业精神状态，如何始终能够及时发现和解决自身存在的问题，如何始终保持风清气正的政治生态。大党独有难题归根到底要靠大党自身力量来解决，要靠大党在长期实践中形成的独特优势来解决。我们党在长期奋斗中所形成的独特优势是全面的，这些独特优势彰显着党的先进性，熔铸于严密组织体系和勇于自我革命之中，是破解大党独有难题的成功密码。 1.马克思主义政党的先进性是破解大党独有难题的内在优势 中国共产党是马克思主义执政党，在长期实践中锻造了推进马克思主义中国化时代化的理论优势、维护党中央权威和集中统一领导的政治优势、密切联系群众的优势，这些优势充分体现了马克思主义政党的先进性，是破解大党独有难题的根本所在。 政治优势和理论优势确保党始终统一思想、统一意志、统一行动，始终保持干事创业的精神状态。当今世界，社会思潮纷纭激荡，先进文化和落后观念相互交织，在新征程上要做到团结一致、振奋精神、不懈奋斗，就必须以政治建设统领党的建设各项工作。旗帜鲜明讲政治，既是马克思主义政党的鲜明特征，也是我们党一以贯之的政治优势。只有加强党的政治建设，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，才能实现全党团结统一、行动一致。马克思主义政党的先进性，首先体现为思想理论上的先进性。注重思想建党、理论强党，是我们党的鲜明特色和理论优势。中国共产党坚持把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合，围绕事关党和国家前途命运的重大问题不断发展党的理论创新成果，接续回答革命、建设、改革不同历史时期的时代课题，以党的最新理论成果指导解决不断出现的新难题，用党的创新理论统一思想，使广大党员始终保持干事创业的精神状态。新思想引领新征程。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想在指导实践、推动实践中展现出强大真理力量。只有坚持用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想武装头脑、指导实践、推动工作，不断增强政治认同、思想认同、理论认同、情感认同，切实做到学思用贯通、知信行统一，才能使全党统一思想、统一意志、统一行动，保持旺盛的干事创业的精神状态。 密切联系群众的优势确保党始终不忘初心、牢记使命。人民性是马克思主义最鲜明的品格。始终同人民在一起，为人民利益而奋斗，是马克思主义政党同其他政党的根本区别。中国共产党以马克思主义为指导，始终坚守人民至上的根本立场，具有密切联系群众的内在优势，能够始终将人民群众的利益作为考虑问题的出发点和落脚点，保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，切实保障人民当家作主的主体地位，坚持群众路线，不断解决人民群众急难愁盼的现实问题。尽管在前进的道路上也会遇到困难和挫折，但是中国共产党没有自己的私利，能够为了人民的利益而坚持真理、修正错误。正如毛泽东同志所说，共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。密切联系群众的优势，使我们党能够凝聚起众志成城的磅礴力量，能够自觉接受群众监督，始终做到不忘初心、牢记使命，把党建设成为始终走在时代前列、人民衷心拥护的马克思主义执政党。 2.严密的组织体系是破解大党独有难题的根本保障 中国共产党作为大党，历史久、人数多、规模大，既有办大事、建伟业的巨大优势，也面临管党治党的独有难题。中国共产党要领导14亿多人口推进中国式现代化，对组织系统的严密体系和高效运转、对执政水平和领导能力都提出了前所未有的新要求。习近平总书记指出：“与国内外形势发展变化相比，与党所承担的历史任务相比，党的领导水平和执政水平，党组织建设状况和党员干部素质、能力、作风都还有不小差距。”党面临的执政考验、改革开放考验、市场经济考验、外部环境考验具有长期性和复杂性，党面临的精神懈怠危险、能力不足危险、脱离群众危险、消极腐败危险具有尖锐性和严峻性，影响党的科学执政、民主执政、依法执政的因素仍然广泛存在，提高党的执政能力与领导水平是一项需要长期面对的重大课题。 党的力量来自组织。严密的组织体系是马克思主义政党鲜明的组织优势，是我们党始终具备强大执政能力与领导水平的组织保障。习近平总书记指出：“我们党是按照马克思主义建党原则建立起来的，形成了包括党的中央组织、地方组织、基层组织在内的严密组织体系。这是世界上任何其他政党都不具有的强大优势。”中国共产党以民主集中制为根本的组织和活动原则，坚持民主基础上的集中和集中指导下的民主相结合，既维护了党中央定于一尊、一锤定音的权威，又注重发挥地方组织尤其是基层党组织坚强的战斗堡垒作用，能够实现党组织对内有序运行和对外权威高效，不断提高党组织的凝聚力和向心力。正确的政治路线要靠正确的组织路线来保证。中国共产党要始终具备强大的执政能力和领导水平，就要以组织体系建设为重点，着力培养忠诚干净担当的高素质干部队伍，抓好后继有人这个根本大计，着力集聚爱国奉献的各方面优秀人才，从而凝聚起实现中华民族伟大复兴的磅礴伟力。 3.勇于自我革命是破解大党独有难题的内在动力 自我监督是世界性难题，而对人数众多的大党来说，又增加了对党员监督管理的难度。习近平总书记提醒全党：“这么大一个党，处在执政地位、掌控执政资源，很容易在执政业绩光环的照耀下，出现忽略自身不足、忽视自身问题的现象，陷入‘革别人命容易，革自己命难’的境地。”若党内存在的问题不能被及时发现，小问题久而久之也可能会导致危险局面。自我革命是刀刃向内、自剜腐肉的过程，这需要以猛药去疴、重典治乱的决心，勇于承受刮骨疗毒、壮士断腕的切身之痛，这对政党而言绝非易事。中国共产党一直努力探索跳出治乱兴衰历史周期率的答案。毛泽东同志在延安的窑洞给出了第一个答案：“让人民来监督政府。”经过百年奋斗特别是党的十八大以来新的实践，党又给出了第二个答案，这就是自我革命。勇于自我革命，是我们党最鲜明的品格，也是我们党最大的优势。中国共产党的伟大不在于不犯错误，而在于从不讳疾忌医，敢于直面问题，勇于自我革命，具有极强的自我修复能力。勇于自我革命的优势确保党始终能够及时发现和解决自身存在的问题。健全全面从严治党体系是解决大党独有难题的重大举措。我们党通过不断健全党内法规制度、不断完善全面从严治党制度、构建自我革命制度规范体系，推动党内监督同国家机关监督、民主监督、司法监督、群众监督、舆论监督相贯通，建立起统一领导、全面覆盖、权威高效的监督体系，推动各方面制度体系更加成熟定型。用制度管党治党，要求各级党员干部以党的制度体系为标准，自觉对标对表，及时发现存在的问题，及时纠正行为偏差，始终做到坚持真理、修正错误。 “天下之难持者莫如心，天下之易染者莫如欲。”部分党员干部经受不住利益诱惑，容易纪律松弛、弄虚作假，滥用权力、贪污受贿、腐化堕落、违法乱纪等现象仍不同程度存在。这些不良作风是侵蚀党的健康肌体的病毒，对党内风清气正的政治生态具有严重危害。加强纪律建设是全面从严治党的治本之策。习近平总书记指出：“我们党是靠革命理想和铁的纪律组织起来的马克思主义政党，纪律严明是党的光荣传统和独特优势。”发挥中国共产党严明的纪律优势能够使党保持风清气正的政治生态。我们党相继出台、完善多部纪律文件，用严格的纪律法规制度来规范引导党员干部的言行，明确不可触犯的纪律高压线。中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我们党不断完善《关于新形势下党内政治生活的若干准则》，修订《中国共产党纪律处分条例》，出台《中国共产党重大事项请示报告条例》等，形成了包括政治纪律、组织纪律、廉洁纪律、群众纪律、工作纪律、生活纪律在内的全方位纪律体系。我们党用严明的纪律规矩根除腐败现象的生存空间和滋生土壤，有效维护了党内风清气正的政治生态。 “志之难也，不在胜人，在自胜。”中国共产党是世界上最大的马克思主义政党，团结带领全国各族人民取得了举世瞩目的伟大成就，我们党没有沉浸在大党地位和光鲜成绩之中，而是以睿智的眼光清醒认识到了大党独有难题。中国共产党继承了马克思主义政党的先进性，厚植中华优秀传统文化，在长期革命、建设、改革实践中形成并发展了理论优势、政治优势、组织优势、制度优势、纪律严明优势和密切联系群众的优势等。这些“大党独有优势”是破解“大党独有难题”的重要法宝。新时代新征程，要充分发扬党的优良传统和独特优势，将党自身的优势不断转化为制胜优势，推动党不断自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高，把党建设成为始终走在时代前列、人民衷心拥护、勇于自我革命、经得起各种风浪考验、朝气蓬勃的马克思主义执政党，领导中国特色社会主义事业航船劈波斩浪、一往无前，向着更加壮阔的航程行稳致远。 作者：王炳林（北京市习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想研究中心特约研究员），王富军（新疆大学特聘教授）,https://web.archive.org/web/20240114000624/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16279935.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240112102216/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16279935.html,2024-01-14 0:00:00,Cracking the Unique Problems of Large Parties with Their Unique Advantages Source: Guangming Daily Author: Wang Binglin Editor in Chief: Yu Yaqian 2024-01-11 10:10:30 0,"General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in the report of the 20th Party Congress that ""as the world's largest Marxist ruling party, our Party, in order to consistently win the support of the people and consolidate its position of long-term power, must at all times maintain the sobriety and steadfastness to solve the unique problems of a large party."" Adhering to the problem orientation, recognizing the existence of unique problems shows that our party has a deep sense of anxiety and a sense of historical responsibility; adhering to the righteousness and innovation, believing that the problems can be solved shows that our party has a strong sense of responsibility and the spirit of historical initiative. Greatness has its own appearance, and there are also great difficulties. The big party has a unique problem centered on the ""six how to always"", that is, how to always remember the original heart, remember the mission, how to always unify thought, will, action, how to always have a strong governing ability and leadership level, how to always maintain the spirit of entrepreneurship, how to always be able to find and solve their own problems, how to always maintain a clear and clean environment. How to always find and solve their own problems in a timely manner, how to always maintain a clean and upright political ecology. In the final analysis, the unique problems of a large party should be solved by the party's own strength, and by the unique advantages of a large party formed in long-term practice. The unique advantages of our party formed in the long-term struggle are comprehensive, and these unique advantages manifest the party's advancement, which are fused in the tight organization system and courageous self-revolution, and are the success code for cracking the unique problems of large parties. 1. The advanced nature of Marxist political party is the inherent advantage of cracking the unique problems of large parties The CPC is a Marxist ruling party, and in the long-term practice, it has forged the theoretical advantage of advancing the modernization of Marxism, the political advantage of safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee and centralized and united leadership, and the advantage of close contact with the masses, which fully embody the advanced nature of the Marxist political party, and are the fundamental advantages of cracking the unique problems of large parties. These advantages fully embody the advanced nature of Marxist political parties and are fundamental to solving the unique problems of large parties. The political and theoretical advantages ensure that the Party is always united in thought, will and action, and always maintains the spirit of entrepreneurship. In today's world, where social trends are diverse and turbulent, and advanced culture and backward concepts are intertwined, it is necessary to unite, energize, and strive relentlessly on the new journey, so that political construction must lead the Party's construction work. Speaking clearly about politics is both a distinctive feature of Marxist political parties and a consistent political advantage of our party. Only by strengthening the Party's political construction, deeply comprehending the decisive significance of the ""two establishments"", enhancing the ""four consciousnesses"", firming up the ""four self-confidence"", and achieving the ""two safeguards"", will the Party be able to realize the ""two safeguards"" and the ""two safeguards"" of the ""two safeguards"". The Party's unity and consistency of action can only be achieved by strengthening the ""four consciousnesses"", firming up the ""four confidence"", and achieving the ""two safeguards"". The advanced nature of the Marxist political party is first reflected in the advanced nature of ideology and theory. Focusing on ideology to build the Party and theory to strengthen the Party is the distinctive feature and theoretical advantage of our Party. The CPC insists on combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's concrete realities and with China's excellent traditional culture, constantly developing the Party's theoretical innovations around major issues concerning the future destiny of the Party and the country, answering the problems of the times in different historical periods of revolution, construction and reform, solving the new problems that keep arising with the guidance of the Party's latest theoretical achievements, and unifying the Party's thinking with its innovative theories, so that the majority of Party members can always maintain the ability to carry out their duties and start up businesses. The majority of Party members always maintain the spirit of entrepreneurship. New ideas lead a new journey. Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has demonstrated a powerful force of truth in guiding and promoting practice. Only by adhering to the idea of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of Xi Jinping, arming the mind, guiding practice and promoting work, constantly strengthening political identity, ideological identity, theoretical identity and emotional identity, and practically realizing the coherence of learning, thinking and application, and the unity of knowledge, belief and action, can the whole Party unify its thoughts, will and action, and maintain a vigorous state of mind for business. The advantage of close contact with the masses ensures that the Party will always remember its original spirit and mission. Peoplehood is the most distinctive character of Marxism. Always being with the people and fighting for the people's interests is the fundamental difference between Marxist political parties and other political parties. Guided by Marxism, the CPC always adheres to the fundamental position of the people's supremacy, and has the inherent advantage of being in close contact with the masses. It is able to always take the interests of the people as the starting and ending point of its consideration of problems, maintain the Party's flesh-and-blood ties with the people, effectively safeguard the people's main position as the masters of their own house, and adhere to the mass line to constantly solve the people's urgent, difficult, and worrying problems and realities. Despite the difficulties and setbacks it encounters along the way, the CPC has no self-interest and is able to uphold the truth and correct errors in the interests of the people. As Comrade MAO Zedong said, communists must be ready to uphold the truth, for any truth is in the interest of the people; communists must be ready to correct errors, for any error is not in the interest of the people. The advantage of close contact with the masses enables our Party to gather the majestic strength of all the people, to consciously accept the supervision of the masses, to always keep the original intention and the mission in mind, and to build the Party into a Marxist ruling party that is always at the forefront of the times and wholeheartedly supported by the people. 2. A strict organizational system is the fundamental guarantee for cracking the unique problems of a big party The CPC, as a big party with a long history, a large number of people, and a large scale, has the great advantage of doing great things and building a great career, but it also faces the unique problems of party management and party governance. The CPC has to lead more than 1.4 billion people to push forward Chinese-style modernization, which puts unprecedented new requirements on the strict system and efficient operation of the organization system, as well as on the level of governance and leadership ability. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""compared with the development and changes of the situation at home and abroad, and compared with the historical tasks undertaken by the Party, there is still a considerable gap between the Party's level of leadership and governance, the state of Party organization construction and the quality, ability and style of Party members and cadres."" The test of governance, the test of reform and opening up, the test of market economy, and the test of external environment faced by the Party are long-term and complex; the danger of slackness of spirit, the danger of insufficient ability, the danger of detachment from the masses, and the danger of passive corruption faced by the Party are acute and serious; the factors affecting the Party's scientific, democratic, and lawful governance are still widespread; and the enhancement of the Party's ability to govern and its leadership is a major issue that needs to be faced for a long time. Improving the Party's ability to govern and its level of leadership is a major issue to be faced in the long term. The strength of the Party comes from its organization. A tight organizational system is the distinctive organizational advantage of Marxist political parties, and it is the organizational guarantee for the Party's strong governing ability and leadership level. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, ""Our party was founded in accordance with the Marxist principles of party building, and has formed a strict organizational system including the central, local and grassroots organizations of the party. This is a powerful advantage that no other political party in the world possesses."" With democratic centralism as its fundamental principle of organization and activity, the CPC adheres to the combination of centralization on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization, which not only safeguards the authority of the Party Central Committee in setting the tone, but also focuses on giving full play to the role of local organizations, especially grass-roots organizations, as strong fighting pillars, and is able to realize the orderly operation of the Party organization internally as well as its authoritative and efficient operation externally, and to continually improve the cohesion and centripetal force of the Party organization. A correct political line is guaranteed by a correct organizational line. If the CPC wants to have a strong governing ability and leadership level, it should focus on the construction of the organization system, make efforts to cultivate a high-quality cadre force that is loyal, clean and responsible, grasp the fundamental plan of succession, and make efforts to gather patriotic and dedicated talents in all aspects, so as to unite the magnificent power of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 3. Courageous self-revolution is the intrinsic motivation to crack the unique problems of large parties Self-supervision is a worldwide problem, and for large parties with a large number of people, it increases the difficulty of supervision and management of party members. General Secretary Xi Jinping reminded the whole party: ""Such a big party, in a ruling position and in control of the ruling resources, it is easy to ignore its own shortcomings and problems under the halo of ruling performance, and fall into a situation where it is easy to revolutionize other people's lives, but difficult to revolutionize its own life. "" If problems within the Party cannot be detected in time, small problems may lead to dangerous situations over time. Self-revolution is a process of turning the knife blade inward and plucking out the rotten flesh, which requires the determination to remove the disease with fierce medicine and treat the disorder with severe punishment, and the courage to bear the personal pain of scraping the bones and cutting off the wrists, which is by no means an easy task for political parties. The CPC has been trying to find an answer to the question of how to break out of the historical cycle of the rise and fall of the CPC. Comrade Mao Zedong gave the first answer in a kiln in Yan'an: ""Let the people supervise the government."" After a hundred years of struggle, especially the new practice since the 18th Party Congress, the Party has given a second answer, which is self-revolution. The courage to self-revolution is the most distinctive character of our Party and its greatest advantage. The greatness of the CPC does not lie in the fact that it does not make mistakes, but in the fact that it never avoids treating illnesses, dares to face problems head-on, is brave in self-revolution, and has a strong self-repairing ability. The advantage of courageous self-revolution ensures that the Party is always able to identify and solve its own problems in a timely manner. Improving the system of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party is a major initiative to solve the unique problems of large parties. By constantly improving the Party's internal regulations and systems, constantly perfecting the system of comprehensively governing the Party strictly, and building a system of self-revolutionary institutions and norms, the Party promotes internal supervision of the Party in conjunction with supervision by state organs, democratic supervision, judicial supervision, mass supervision, and supervision by public opinion, and establishes a supervisory system that is uniformly led, comprehensively covered, authoritative, and efficient, and promotes the institutional system of all aspects to become more mature and finalized. Using the system to govern the Party requires Party members and cadres at all levels to take the Party's institutional system as the standard, consciously benchmarking and benchmarking, discovering existing problems and correcting behavioral deviations in a timely manner, and always adhering to the truth and correcting errors. ""The world's hard to hold is nothing like the heart, and the world's easy to color is nothing like desire."" Some party members and cadres can not withstand the temptation of interests, easy to discipline laxity, falsehoods, abuse of power, corruption and bribery, corruption, lawlessness and other phenomena still exist to varying degrees. These undesirable styles are viruses that erode the healthy body of the party, and are seriously harmful to the party's clean political ecology. Strengthening the construction of discipline is the fundamental solution to the overall strict governance of the Party. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""our party is a Marxist political party organized on revolutionary ideals and iron discipline, and strict discipline is the glorious tradition and unique advantage of the party."" Utilizing the CPC's advantage of strict discipline can enable the Party to maintain a clean political ecology. Our Party has successively introduced and improved a number of disciplinary documents, using strict disciplinary regulations and systems to standardize and guide the words and deeds of Party members and cadres, and making clear the high pressure line of discipline that cannot be violated. As socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, the Party has continuously improved the Guidelines on Internal Political Life of the Party in the New Circumstances, revised the Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and issued the Regulations on the Reporting of Major Matters by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which have formed an all-encompassing disciplinary system that includes political, organizational, integrity, mass, work, and life disciplines. Our Party has used strict disciplinary rules to eradicate the living space and breeding ground for corruption, effectively maintaining a clean and upright political ecology within the Party. ""The difficulty of ambition is not in winning, but in winning oneself."" The CPC is the world's largest Marxist political party, uniting and leading the people of all nationalities to make great achievements that have attracted world attention. Our Party has not immersed itself in the status of a large party and glorious achievements, but has soberly realized the unique difficulties of a large party with a wise vision. The CPC has inherited the advanced nature of Marxist political parties, has cultivated the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and has formed and developed theoretical, political, organizational, institutional, disciplinary and close contact with the masses advantages during the long practice of revolution, construction and reform. These ""unique advantages of large parties"" are important magic weapons to solve ""unique problems of large parties"". In the new era and new journey, we should fully carry forward the Party's fine traditions and unique advantages, turn the Party's own advantages into winning advantages, promote the Party's continuous self-purification, self-improvement, self-innovation, and self-improvement, and build the Party into a vigorous Marxist ruling party that is always ahead of its time, wholeheartedly embraced by its people, courageous in self-revolution, and able to withstand all kinds of winds and storms, so as to lead the boat of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics to cut through waves and waves. We will lead the ship of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics to cut through waves and waves and move forward without any obstacles, so that it can travel steadily and far towards a more magnificent voyage. By Wang Binglin (Special Researcher, Beijing Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era) and Wang Fujun (Distinguished Professor, Xinjiang University)","This article discusses the unique problems faced by large political parties, such as the Communist Party of China (CPC), and how these problems can be solved. It highlights the advantage of the CPC's strict organizational system, which is essential for maintaining a strong governing ability and leadership level. The article also emphasizes the importance of courageous self-revolution, which involves addressing and solving the party's own problems internally.

Intelligent technology with full-dimensional penetration, cross-domain aggregation, heterogeneous fusion advantages, can help build military elements of horizontal coordination, vertical integration of military operations, the overall optimization of the system operation of the military governance pattern. Those who are aware of the situation are smart, and those who are trending are wise. In the face of new features and changes in the era of intelligence, we need to carry forward the spirit of reform and innovation, focus on expanding the paradigm of military governance, constructing a modern military governance system, improving the capacity of modern military governance, and promoting high-quality development with a high level of governance. Panoramic empowerment: fusion of governance fields, construction of collaborative governance Artificial intelligence technology through panoramic empowerment, cross-field and cross-sectoral governance elements connected and integrated as a whole, to achieve systematic optimization of the military governance interface, to drive the synergistic pattern of military governance from point discrete to fusion and interaction iterative leap, and to construct a new model of collaborative governance. Main cross-domain synergy. Intelligent technology provides architectural support for military governance through ubiquitous perception and virtual-real interaction, aggregates multiple military governance subjects into a system, and through the powerful agglomeration of advantageous resources, cohesive co-governance synergy, stimulates co-construction vitality, and strengthens sharing effectiveness. Artificial intelligence technology, with data fusion, business synergism and virtual-reality integration, changes the traditional ""dominant-subordinate"", ""center-edge"", ""active-passive"" collaboration mode. It changes the traditional ""dominant-subordinate"", ""center-edge"", ""active-passive"" collaboration model, and realizes the cross-domain union, resource aggregation, functional coupling and capability integration of military governance subjects through the multilateral, dynamic and continuous interaction of governance subjects and the integration of resources, technologies, platforms and talent advantages. In the era of intelligence, military governance through unimpeded vertical synergy, open internal and external synergy, integration of virtual and real synergy, to promote the integration of strategic planning, policy and system articulation, and sharing of resources and elements between different governance subjects, and to promote the coordinated development of military governance in key regions, key areas, and emerging areas. Path integration synergy. Intelligent technology through the digital collection of military governance elements, standardized processing, networked connections, the physical world is highly data-driven, the physical world is reshaped with digital form mapping, realizing the physical domain, the information domain and other areas of coherence. Using artificial intelligence technology, it is possible to systematically build an integrated military governance information network platform across the military, across fields, and across systems, effectively integrating multiple governance paths such as leadership, coordination, guidance, and interaction, and driving the transformation of fragmented management to holistic governance. Military governance will be based on the information network platform, realizing synergy and synergy in the three dimensions of macro, meso and micro, and promoting the stability of military governance. Information interaction and synergy. The efficient flow of information can enhance the efficiency of organizational operations. With the help of intelligent technology, we can build an information network platform for military governance that is supported by the network and the cloud, horizontally integrated across domains and vertically integrated, integrating the use of information identification, induction, correlation, deduction, inference, prediction, judgment and other means, and constructing an information center that combines information on the needs of the troops, information on the local potentials, algorithmic analysis information, and auxiliary decision-making information. Relying on the information network platform, multi-dimensional and cross-domain information can be gathered and fused into ""one map"", realizing on-demand push, independent query and accurate distribution of information interaction, ensuring that different nodes of military governance can accurately grasp the situation in real time. Military governance in the era of intelligence, with information interaction ""penetrating"" the traditional boundaries, to realize the military governance information of the whole time and space synergy, the whole unit synergy, the whole link synergy, drive information interaction from one-way degree to multi-dimensional evolution, to information interaction synergy to promote the integration of military governance in multiple domains. Incremental empowerment: optimizing the governance ecology, creating resilient governance Artificial intelligence technology enhances the perceived ability of the subject of military governance, while also providing a channel for its participation in the practice of military governance, realizing incremental empowerment. Thanks to this, the main body of military governance presents a tendency of flat configuration and structural downward shift, driving military governance from a strong structure, strong control, and strong standards model, evolving into a model of multilateral synergy, interactive consultation, and associative coupling, and constructing and forming an integrated resilient military governance system. Strong structural toughness. Military governance in the era of intelligence, the organization of the operation of the wide-area, the complexity of unprecedented prominence, breaking the original hierarchical governance of the path of dependence, the impact of the traditional military governance field of discourse, the right to know, the right to participate in the configuration of the pattern, the formation of a new path of empowerment of military governance. Artificial intelligence technology to incremental empowerment, for the interaction of multiple governance subjects of common governance to provide a new mechanism, the main body of the governance will be absorbed and aggregated to the same field, the formation of the formation of interaction and common governance of the military governance organizational structure. Intelligent technology expands the new practice of connecting the real scene with the virtual scene, and interacting the physical space with the cyberspace, and through the flexibility and elasticity of grasping the balance between rigidity and flexibility, unification and division, coarseness and refinement, it stimulates the initiative and enthusiasm of the main body to participate in the practice of military governance, enhances the vitality and elasticity of the military governance organizations at different levels, and strengthens the resilience of the organizational structure of the military governance. Enhancing institutional toughness. Artificial intelligence technology is applied to the field of military governance, and the linking structure between the subjects of governance will present characteristics such as boundary ambiguity and cross-border connectivity. For this reason, it is necessary to plan for the situation, analyze the intrinsic mechanism of technology-empowered military governance, build a brand new mechanism that is compatible with the command system, force formation, and equipment development, coupling and mutual construction of technology and systems, and opening up the cross-border area and the public area of ""fusion"" to stimulate the vitality of the system. In the field of military governance, the potential of military governance is stimulated by the vitality of the system. Military governance in the era of intelligence, we should formulate a list of empowerment according to the time and situation, improve the configuration of powers and responsibilities, institutional norms and operational modes, and promote the downward leaning of military governance resources, the sinking of forces, and the downward shift of the center of gravity within the scope of the controllable boundaries to enhance the ability to cope with external shocks and drive the emergence of the military system as a whole through the systematization of systematic innovations, the seamlessness of articulations, and the accuracy of implementation. Enhance cultural resilience. ""The soul of the nation is transformed by culture; the god of the country, cast by culture."" Culture as a kind of soft power, has a strong integration cohesion function, is the endogenous force of military governance. Military governance in the era of intelligence, blockchain and other technologies are embedded in the whole process of military governance, providing a new collaboration model for the integration and sharing of information, analysis and processing, and promoting efficient and transparent governance. Intelligent technology can establish a distributed, open and secure trust mechanism, break through traditional structural relationships, effectively aggregate the value orientation and interest orientation of multiple military governance subjects, enhance goal identity, emotional identity, rule identity and action identity, maximize governance trust, and provide an internal engine for military governance. Reconstructive empowerment of intelligence: reshaping the governance chain to achieve agile governance Science and technology is the core fighting force, and it is a strong driving force to promote military governance. Intelligent technology maps the real world into digital space through networked reshaping and scenario recreating, connecting micro and macro, virtual and real. Through the reconstructive empowerment of wisdom, you can promote the deep fusion of technological means and governance scenarios, and drive the paradigm transmutation of military governance with fast, sensitive and efficient means of governance. Perception with wisdom. With the continuous upgrading of the Internet and the Internet of Things, the high-speed and ubiquitous information network that connects everything may become the material foundation and technical support for the enhancement of the effectiveness of military governance. By building a complete chain of perception network, information cloud, data flow, situational map, etc., realizing real-time monitoring, collection and integration of multi-domain data and open sharing, real space, electromagnetic space, cyberspace and other organic aggregation, the virtual and the reality will be increasingly fused into one. In the era of intelligence, the main body of military governance through the dynamic attitude perception, in-depth perception, correlation perception, to achieve all-time omnidirectional collection of military governance data, full-dimensional domain-wide extraction, holographic panoramic presentation. At the same time, the main body of military governance relies on massive data mining, scene algorithm application, comprehensive integration of multi-source heterogeneous data, realizing the rapid capture and accurate identification of potential demand, cracking the military governance problem, and enhancing the agility of military governance under the large-scale complex field. Intelligent decision-making. Intelligent technology applied to the field of military governance can gather the wisdom of multiple military governance subjects, construct and form a collective collaboration mode with complementary strengths, and inject intelligent genes into the art of decision-making to stimulate group intelligence. Comprehensive use of big data technology, with the help of machine learning, edge computing, intelligent decision-making, parallel arithmetic, through the problem-oriented data mining, logical extension of the decision-making correlation, change the experience of decision-making into actuarial decision-making, to realize the organic unity of cluster decision-making, distribution decision-making and autonomous decision-making. In the era of intelligence, military governance is based on the cross-border configuration of decision-making subjects, the mingling and integration of decision-making processes, and the collaboration and interaction of decision-making methods, to create a military governance ecosystem that gathers group efforts, clusters wisdom, and gathers group strategies, to assist the main body of governance in different scenarios, relying on data to support intelligent decision-making, and to enhance the agility of the practice of military governance. Control by intelligence. Intelligent technology has broadened the information access channels, shortened the information transmission chain, and the operation carrier of the military governance process has changed. In the era of intelligence, military governance relies on artificial intelligence technology to realize a panoramic view of military multifaceted needs through data capture, deep mining, and user profiling. At the same time, through the front-end perception, mid-end response, terminal iteration, to support the main body of military governance according to the dynamic regulation of the situation, based on the effect of efficient regulation, around the process of flexible regulation, to enhance the effectiveness of military governance. In the era of intelligence, military governance is driven by data and algorithms in a dual-wheel drive mode, through the flexible combination of elements on demand and agile and flexible reconfiguration of processes, to build a real-time and accurate flexible adaptation system of military governance, to realize the two-way interaction of the main body of governance, the dynamic adaptation of the governance process, and the precise control of the governance scenarios, to pre-judge the risks, and to shape a flexible and agile military governance system.","The article outlines the concept of forward-looking military governance in the era of intelligence, emphasizing the use of artificial intelligence technology to enhance the effectiveness of military governance. It highlights the advantages of intelligent technology, such as its ability to fully integrate various domains, enhance cross-domain coordination, and improve the overall optimization of the military governance pattern.

Cross-military governance is a systematic and comprehensive governance, involving cross-military collaboration in multiple fields, and it is necessary to explore cross-military governance model innovation with systematic thinking and the spirit of reform and innovation, focusing on cross-military governance system closed-loop construction, chain linking, and system evaluation. Strengthen the system concept of cross-military governance. Cross-military governance model innovation, must strengthen the system concept. Cross-military governance is a complex systematic project, and the system concept must be used to promote the effectiveness of cross-military governance. A comprehensive, systematic, connected thinking to understand, analyze and solve cross-military problems, grasp the current and long-term, whole and part, structure and function, system and environment of the dialectical relationship between, and strive to cross-military governance of the overall effectiveness of the optimal. Secondly, we should centralize the scattered elements between the military and the land, and realize the most scientific association and coupling between elements; highly integrate the two systems of the military and the land, and form the organic fusion and integration of the ""system of systems"" to give full play to the overall power and improve the synergistic efficiency of the military and the land. Thirdly, we should focus on the major tasks facing the systematic combat capability construction, constantly optimize the content, mode and mechanism of war construction and preparation coordination and cross-domain coordination between the military and the land, and accelerate the establishment of a matrix organization system, task system and responsibility system with war leading construction, domain synergy, military and land integration, and organic coupling of multiple subjects. Build a complete closed loop of cross-military governance. Cross-military governance model innovation, we must start from the overall height, to create a seamless closed-loop governance system. Closed-loop governance requires that we always stand at the height of the overall national security and development strategy to strategize and plan the deployment, adhere to the problem-oriented, and do our respective responsibilities. To build a cross-military closed-loop governance system, we should closely focus on the main body of the ""people"", from the perspective of the overall smooth, orderly and efficient, from the national, military and local levels, through the integration of information, technology, talent, facilities, services and other elements, from planning, planning to implementation and evaluation, to build a closed-loop system link. It is necessary to strengthen the top-level design and strategic planning, and promote the construction of a ""one-chess"" system from the top of the country to the military and local levels. The military should adhere to the military demand for national defense construction, strengthen the synergistic development of the military, and continuously improve the level of cross-military governance capabilities. Local party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen their awareness of national defense and do their part in national defense construction. The military should carry the political responsibility of the party in charge of the armed forces, vigorously carry forward the glorious tradition of double embrace, and solve the urgent problems of soldiers and officers with heart and soul, and widely condense the strong synergy of cross-military governance. Smooth cross-military governance system link. Cross-military governance model innovation, we must focus on the links of the cross-military governance system, the whole chain. First of all, to open up the chain of cross-military governance planning program. Establish and improve the cross-military governance strategic planning system, integrate military needs, resources and construction tasks, and incorporate them into the national unified planning system. The regional departments and industries have formulated military development plans in a coordinated manner to ensure that the plans are complementary and articulated. Secondly, to open up the chain of military demand management. Give full play to the pulling effect of military demand on national defense construction, and solve the problem of ""difficult to generate"", ""difficult to coordinate"" and ""difficult to implement"" military demand. Constructing the military demand, the relevant functional departments to carry out coordination, military and local coordination and implementation of the military demand management system, the systematic, accurate, dynamic military demand into the national economic construction system. Once again, to open up the cross-military governance coordination and docking link. To build a military-to-military docking mechanism that links multiple subjects, war construction and preparation, improve military-to-military docking methods, docking processes and supporting policies and systems, and establish a military-to-military coordination and docking work catalog and task list with consistent rights and responsibilities and clear interfaces. Finally, open up the chain of cross-military resource sharing. It has perfected the standard system for military-to-military compatibility, established a resource-sharing system, compiled and released a catalog of military-to-military shareable resources, coordinated incremental and stock resources, and guided and supported the orderly opening and sharing of various types of resources and elements. Improve the system and mechanism of cross-military governance. To innovate the mode of cross-military governance, it is necessary to strengthen the policy and institutional guarantee for the coordination and convergence of the military and the land in cross-military governance. Cross-military governance is fundamentally the governance of the system, which requires the standardization, institutionalization, and normalization of interaction between the military and the multiple participating subjects. To this end, we must strengthen the concept of governance in accordance with the law, always adhere to the problem-oriented, military and land in accordance with the law around the major issues of sound policies and systems, joint demonstration of the implementation of joint assessment and review.

We should be firm and confident, and continue to explore and improve it in practice, so that this road will become wider and wider. General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly elaborated a series of major theoretical and practical issues in promoting the high-quality development of China's finance from the strategic height of the overall development of the Party and the country, which is based on a far-reaching vision, broad vision, profound thinking and rich in connotation, which is of great significance for the Party to correctly understand the situation and tasks of China's financial development, and deepen its understanding of the essential laws of financial work and the road of development, and provides an important framework for us to unswervingly walk the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics. It provides an important guideline for us to unswervingly follow the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics. Unswervingly taking the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics and promoting the high-quality development of China's finance are the general requirements for doing a good job of financial work in the new era. It is necessary to deeply grasp the fundamental purpose of financial services for the real economy, highlight high-quality development as the hard truth of the new era, adhere to the idea of economic and financial chess, grasp the focus and key of high-quality development of finance from the interaction between economy and finance, and accelerate the construction of a strong financial country. Focus on building key core financial elements. Based on the ""two big situations"", building a strong currency, a strong central bank, a strong financial institution, a strong international financial center, a strong financial regulation, and a strong team of financial talents at the national strategic level is the way to promote China's high-quality financial development and realize the transformation from big to strong. A strong currency is a concentrated manifestation of national strength, and it is necessary to advance the internationalization of the RMB in a prudent and solid manner, and to promote the expansion of the RMB from a trade settlement function to an investment reserve function at an accelerated pace. A strong central bank and financial supervision is the key to enhancing the effectiveness of financial governance, safeguarding financial stability, and strengthening the coordination of international macro-policy dialogues. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a modern central banking system, comprehensively strengthen financial supervision, and make efforts to promote the modernization of financial governance. Strong financial institutions and international financial centers are the main carriers and platforms of market-oriented financial business, playing the functions of financing, allocating resources, and dispersing risks, etc. It is necessary to focus on building financial institutions and international financial centers with international first-class competitiveness, and to enhance China's influence and pricing power in the field of international finance. Strong financial talent is the elemental guarantee of high-quality financial development, to accelerate the cultivation of high-end financial professionals, forging a loyal, clean and responsible high-quality professional financial cadres. The formation of key core financial elements depends on the depth and thickness of the financial system, which requires accelerating the construction of a modern financial system with Chinese characteristics, establishing a sound and scientific financial regulation system, a rationally structured financial market system, a system of financial institutions with a division of labor and coordination, a complete and effective financial regulatory system, a diversified and specialized financial products and services system, and an autonomous, controllable, safe and efficient financial infrastructure system. Deepening the structural reform of the financial supply side and expanding the two-way opening of the financial sector at a high level are the key focus points for releasing the endogenous momentum of financial development. Promote the reform and development of financial institutions in accordance with the nature and positioning of institutions, so as to make all kinds of financial institutions more reasonable in terms of scale, structure and regional layout. Deepen the reform of the financial market and solidly promote the implementation of the policy framework for building a modern capital market with Chinese characteristics. Focusing on system-based opening up, we will promote high-level opening up of the financial sector to the outside world, and enhance the level of facilitation of cross-border investment and financing. Efforts will be made to prevent and resolve financial risks. Risk prevention and control is the eternal theme of financial work. It is necessary to place a more important position on proactively preventing and resolving financial risks, especially systemic risks, comprehensively strengthen financial supervision, and continuously enhance the security of financial development with scientific, effective and powerful financial supervision. Accelerate the construction of a full-coverage financial regulatory system and mechanism, focusing on strengthening institutional supervision, behavioral supervision, functional supervision, penetrating supervision and continuous supervision. We will strictly control access, ensure that legal regulation is more important than illegal regulation, regulate the industry to regulate risks, establish standards and mechanisms for cross-institutional regulation and cross-market synergy, prevent regulatory arbitrage and regulatory circumvention, adhere to the principle of ""substance over form"", strengthen behavioral regulation centered on the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of financial consumers and investors, and focus on the full cycle of financial institutions and the full process of financial risk management. It will adhere to the principle of ""substance over form"", strengthen behavioral supervision centering on the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of financial consumers and investors, and strengthen penetrating supervision and continuous supervision around the whole cycle of financial institutions, the whole process of financial risks, and the whole chain of financial businesses. It will strengthen central and local regulatory coordination, enhance regulatory accountability and improve the effectiveness of linkage. At the same time, accelerate the establishment of market-oriented and rule-of-law risk disposal mechanisms. Improve the risk prevention and control mechanism at the source and the market-oriented risk disposal and rescue process. Strengthen the construction of the rule of law in finance, and timely promote legislation in key and emerging areas of finance to escort the development of the financial industry. Strengthening the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee. Adhering to the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee in financial work is a unique advantage of the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics and a fundamental guarantee for good financial work. We should deeply understand the profound connotation of the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics and the position, viewpoints and methods throughout, resolutely safeguard the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and effectively align the correct political direction and development orientation of financial work. Strengthening the Party's leadership throughout the whole process and in all aspects of financial work, resolutely and efficiently implementing the major decisions and deployments of the CPC Central Committee, continuously improving the institutional mechanism of the Party's leadership in financial work, and transforming the Party's leadership as a systemic advantage into the effectiveness of financial governance. Finance is an important part of the core competitiveness of the country, and the high-quality development of finance is related to the overall situation of Chinese-style modernization. Let us continuously deepen our understanding of the essential laws of financial work and the road to development, comprehensively enhance our financial work skills and risk response capabilities, implement the CPC Central Committee's deployment of comprehensively strengthening financial supervision, improving the financial system, optimizing financial services, and guarding against and resolving risks, form a new pattern of financial work that is consistent throughout the country, unswervingly take the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of a financial powerhouse. Author: Huang Weitian (China Macroeconomics) Author: Huang Weiting (Deputy Director, Decision-making and Consulting Department, China Academy of Macroeconomic Research)","In a recent seminar on promoting high-quality financial development, General Secretary of the CPC Xi Jinping emphasized the road of financial development with Chinese characteristics, which not only follows the objective laws of modern financial development but also has distinctive features suited to China's national conditions and is fundamentally different from the Western financial model. The speech emphasized the need to firmly and confidently continue to explore and improve this road in practice, making it wider and wider.

【理响中国】深入领会习近平文化思想的四重维度 来源：中国社会科学网-中国社会科学报 作者：刘建军 范娇阳 责任编辑：李佳琦 2024-01-18 16:37:01 0,2023年10月召开的全国宣传思想文化工作会议，正式提出和系统阐述了习近平文化思想这一重大概念，标志着习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想文化篇的开启。深化对习近平文化思想的体系化建构和学理化阐释，弄清其“何以提出”“从何处来”“向何处去”，对做好新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作，担负起新的文化使命具有十分重要的意义。 全面把握习近平文化思想的时代背景和重大意义 习近平文化思想标注文化建设规律认识的新高度。新时代以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央提出并推动全面贯彻新发展理念，着力推进高质量发展，推动构建新发展格局，夯实全面建设社会主义现代化国家的物质基础。但是，物质文明和精神文明的协调发展不可能自然而然地实现，这就需要处于这个时代的政党、国家和民族深刻把握历史方位，从文化上层建筑层面主动引领时代发展。正是基于对文化在社会发展中地位作用极为深刻的认识，习近平总书记提出“充分认识意识形态工作的极端重要性”“坚定文化自信，建设社会主义文化强国”等原创性论断，形成了习近平文化思想。习近平文化思想不仅体现了我们党对唯物史观的依循，更体现了对文化理论的创造性发展，标注着我们党对当今时代文化发展规律和趋势的认识达到了新的高度。 习近平文化思想赓续党的百年文化自信自强的历史根脉。近代以来，国家蒙辱、人民蒙难、文明蒙尘，中华民族遭受了前所未有的劫难。反思、重塑中华民族传统文化，寻找中华文化和民族精神的未来走向，成为潜藏于反帝反封建任务背后的深层课题。中国共产党的成立，开辟了中华民族文化建设和文化自信自强的新路径。我们党自成立之日起就把建设民族的科学的大众的中华民族新文化作为自己的使命，提出建设中华民族新文化的纲领和主张。社会主义革命和建设时期，毛泽东提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的文化方针，繁荣发展社会主义科技和文化事业。改革开放以后，邓小平提出坚持“两手抓、两手都要硬”，突出文化建设在党和国家工作全局中的重要地位，为建设社会主义文化强国夯实思想认识基础。新时代以来，中国特色社会主义文化不断发展进步，各个国家之间的文化竞争愈发激烈，在这样的时代背景下提出习近平文化思想，在全社会普遍涵养和增进文化自信，传承党的百年文化自信自强的理论品格，正当其时、恰逢其势。 习近平文化思想聚焦及时科学解答时代课题的现实需要。2023年6月，习近平总书记在主持中共中央政治局第六次集体学习时指出“要及时科学解答时代新课题”，强调“我们推进理论创新是实践基础上的理论创新，而不是坐在象牙塔内的空想，必须坚持在实践中发现真理、发展真理，用实践来实现真理、检验真理”。习近平文化思想正是聚焦主要矛盾，准确把握时代的呼声，科学回答新时代坚持和发展什么样的中国特色社会主义文化、怎样坚持和发展中国特色社会主义文化，建设什么样的社会主义文化强国、怎样建设社会主义文化强国，建设什么样的中华民族现代文明、怎样建设中华民族现代文明等重大时代课题的理论结晶。新征程上，文化强国建设面临的问题更为复杂、挑战更为艰巨，置身于我国社会发展、人类社会发展的大逻辑大趋势中，更能深刻体会习近平文化思想对于时代和实践的深远意义。 深刻把握习近平文化思想形成发展的历史纵深 习近平同志在青年时期就对中国经典古籍、历史文化书籍和中国古典诗词展现出了浓厚兴趣，这些阅读和思考为他在后来形成对中华优秀传统文化的深刻认识和科学态度打下坚实基础。在地方工作期间，习近平同志将理论与实践相结合，高度重视对历史文化的保护、传承和发展，身体力行推动历史文化遗产保护工作。担任福州市委书记期间，习近平同志对林觉民、冰心故居保护工作作出重要批示，亲自主持推动故居修缮工程，还为福州市辛亥革命纪念馆省外客人担当讲解员。担任福建省代省长期间，为保护有“南方周口店”之称的史前遗址不为矿山开采而摧毁，习近平同志作出重要批示，明确指出，保护历史文物是国家法律赋予每个人的责任，也是实施可持续发展战略的重要内容。万寿岩旧石器时代洞穴一直作为不可再生的珍贵历史文物，不仅属于我们，也属于后代子孙，任何个人和单位都不能为了谋取眼前或局部利益而破坏全社会和后代的利益。这些论断和举措反映了习近平同志在历史和时代发展大势中正确对待历史文化传统的深刻历史洞见和深邃战略眼光。 习近平同志深刻阐明意识形态工作的本质地位和对意识形态安全的维护。党的十八大以来，随着改革开放的深入和社会主义市场经济不断发展，我们党执政所面临的内外部环境日益严峻复杂，新形势下全党面临“四大考验”和“四大危险”的挑战，由此更加凸显加强宣传思想工作的极端重要性。时代大背景和大气候下，宣传思想工作作为首要的前沿阵地，必须旗帜鲜明地展开正面斗争。2013年的全国宣传思想工作会议明确指出意识形态工作的重要地位和意义，全面系统阐明了宣传思想工作的基本职责、主要内涵、使命任务和原则方针，为做好新时代党的宣传思想工作提供了根本遵循。十余年来，我们党始终把宣传思想工作作为一项极端重要的工作摆在突出位置，积基树本、创新发展，一刻也没有放松意识形态领域的斗争，有力维护了国家政治安全和意识形态安全。 党的十八大以来，习近平总书记反复强调要坚定文化自信，全面推进新时代文化建设。深刻认识“四个自信”的生成和新时代文化建设的全面推进，必须从理论逻辑、历史逻辑和实践逻辑的统一中加以把握。2014年10月15日，在文艺工作座谈会上，习近平总书记强调：“增强文化自觉和文化自信，是坚定道路自信、理论自信、制度自信的题中应有之义。”2016年5月，在哲学社会科学工作座谈会上，习近平总书记谈道：“我们说要坚定中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信，说到底是要坚定文化自信。文化自信是更基本、更深沉、更持久的力量。”同年7月1日，在庆祝中国共产党成立95周年大会上，习近平总书记指出，“文化自信，是更基础、更广泛、更深厚的自信”，强调“坚持不忘初心、继续前进，就要坚持中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信”。在党的十九大报告中，习近平总书记提出：“没有高度的文化自信，没有文化的繁荣兴盛，就没有中华民族伟大复兴。”文化的地位和作用之所以愈发凸显，是因为在中华民族实现站起来、富起来、强起来的历史性飞跃中，文化自信有了坚实的物质基础，发挥作用的舞台更为广阔。在这个过程中，我们党对文化战略地位和作用与文化建设规律的认识逐渐上升到新的高度，文化自信更加坚定，文化建设取得累累硕果。 习近平总书记在庆祝中国共产党成立100周年大会上提出，要把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际相结合、同中华优秀传统文化相结合，在文化传承发展座谈会上又明确提出“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放，成为习近平文化思想中具有标志性意义的重大论断。在“两个结合”的语境中，“马克思主义基本原理同中华优秀传统文化相结合”是作为第一个结合的衍生体被提出的，从与现实国情的结合到与中国历史传统和思想文化的结合，意味着推进马克思主义中国化时代化进入了新阶段、新领域、新境界，体现了马克思主义中国化时代化新的叙事角度。习近平总书记提出“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放，是针对理论和现实中存在的错误对待传统文化或是照搬照抄其他国家文化等思想固化问题提出的，是马克思主义中国化时代化文化叙事体系内的理论创新，打开了更为广阔的文化发展空间。 深入理解习近平文化思想的丰富内涵和鲜明特点 习近平文化思想作为一个不断展开的、开放的思想体系，不仅有文化理论观点上的创新创造，而且有着清晰有力的文化工作部署，实现了认识论和方法论的统一，是新时代新征程宣传思想文化工作的科学指南，标志着我们党对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的认识达到了新高度。加强对习近平文化思想的学习研究阐释，要从整体上把握其主要内容，还要对其内涵和特点进行理论概括、深化学理阐释，找准习近平文化思想的“魂脉”，更好发挥指导和引领实践的作用。 坚持党性与人民性的辩证统一。坚持党性与人民性的辩证统一是新时代以来党领导文化建设实践经验的重要理论总结，是习近平文化思想的鲜明特色。坚持党性与人民性的辩证统一，从根本上说是由中国共产党的性质宗旨及党和人民的关系决定的，作为宣传思想工作的根本准则必须长期坚持和贯彻落实。针对意识形态领域党的领导弱化问题，习近平总书记提出：“要加强党对宣传思想工作的全面领导，旗帜鲜明坚持党管宣传、党管意识形态。”针对宣传思想工作“谁来管”“如何管”“管什么”，习近平总书记强调：“党和政府主办的媒体是党和政府的宣传阵地，必须姓党”；“坚持党性，核心就是坚持正确政治方向，站稳政治立场，坚定宣传党的理论和路线方针政策，坚定宣传中央重大工作部署，坚定宣传中央关于形势的重大分析判断，坚决同党中央保持高度一致，坚决维护中央权威。”针对文艺工作和哲学社会科学研究，习近平总书记要求必须坚持以人民为中心的工作导向，繁荣发展文化事业和文化产业，更好满足人民文化需求，强调文艺创作要扎根人民、扎根生活，坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务，解决好为什么人的根本问题，体现党的性质和根本宗旨，创作出更多无愧于时代、无愧于人民的优秀作品。宣传思想工作的党性和人民性在理论中相互依托，在实践中相互确证，共同绘就了习近平文化思想中一条极为重要的线索。 坚持历史传承与时代发展相互促进。作为世界上唯一从未间断传承的古老文明，中华文明历经数千年而绵延不绝、迭遭忧患而经久不衰，离不开中华优秀传统文化的丰厚滋养。作为中华文明的核心和精华，中华优秀传统文化积淀着中华民族最深沉的精神追求，代表着中华民族独特的精神标识，在中华民族和中华文明的延续和发展中发挥了积极作用。重视传统文化的传承发展，是习近平文化思想的重要内容和鲜明特质，特别是其中关于中华文明在新时代如何实现创新发展的新思想、新观点、新论断，具有十分深远的历史意义和时代价值。一方面，坚守中华文化立场，坚持守正创新，以科学态度推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化和创新性发展。习近平总书记深刻总结了中华文明连续性、创新性、统一性、包容性、和平性五个突出特性，揭示了文化自信的根本来源，强调要在全面深入了解中华文明的基础上推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展，更有力地推进中国特色社会主义文化建设。另一方面，坚定文化自信，以新的文化使命推动中华文明进入新形态，指引中国式现代化发展方向，为发展中国家走向现代化提供文明新选择。 坚持文化多样与整合凝聚有机统一。在当今中国社会，多样文化和社会思潮交织在一起，对社会主流文化和意识形态产生不同程度的影响，如何巩固壮大主流意识形态成为文化建设贯穿始终的重要课题。百余年来，我们党始终重视运用文化引领人民前进方向，通过推进文化建设为革命、建设和改革事业汇聚力量。新时代以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央创造性地提出坚持马克思主义在意识形态领域指导地位的根本制度，从制度层面确保中国特色社会主义文化沿着正确的方向和道路前进，极大巩固了全党全国人民团结奋斗的共同思想基础。在党的二十大报告中，习近平总书记阐述了“两个结合”的深刻内涵，指明马克思主义中国化时代化的根本途径。在文化传承发展座谈会上，习近平总书记指出“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放，强调：“‘结合’的结果是互相成就，造就了一个有机统一的新的文化生命体，让马克思主义成为中国的，中华优秀传统文化成为现代的，让经由‘结合’而形成的新文化成为中国式现代化的文化形态。”中国式现代化的文化形态本身蕴含三重文明语境，是中华文明、现代化文明和社会主义文明时空交汇的结果。这种融合本身就是一种创新，不是简单的物理相加，而是化学意义上的整合凝聚，使“魂脉”“根脉”和多重文明语境之间发生深刻化学反应，进而巩固文化主体性，增进民族文化认同，迸发出更为强大的民族凝聚力和向心力。 坚持以我为主与文明互鉴交叉融合。中华文明本身具有以我为主、兼收并蓄的基因。古希腊文明、两河流域文明、古埃及文明、古印度文明皆因被殖民和外来文化入侵而走向衰败，最终碎片化甚至中断在历史长河之中。唯有中华文明在积极吸收和融合外来文明优秀成果过程中保持了自身的文化主体性，形成多元一体的格局。从党的百年奋斗历程看，我们党很早就认识到文化建设要“以我为主”。进入新时代，习近平总书记丰富发展了文化建设的原则方法，提出坚持文化发展要以我为主、洋为中用、辩证取舍，加强国际传播能力建设，不断提升文化软实力和中华文化影响力。加快构建中国特色哲学社会科学，建构中国自主的知识体系，明确了新时代我国哲学社会科学工作者的崇高使命。习近平总书记始终站在把握人类文明演进规律的高度审视和思考中华文明的传承发展、对外传播和交流互鉴。强调坚持以我为主并不是以我为尊、排斥外来，而是在尊重差异、理解个性的基础上平等交流、互相借鉴。中华文明是在同其他文明不断交流互鉴中形成的开放体系，交流互鉴是文明发展的本质要求，呼吁世界各国弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，体现了宽广、开放的国际视野。文化越是民族的，越是世界的。中国特色社会主义所要创造的人类文明新形态，表现为能够交流互鉴的开放性文明形态，而不是孤芳自赏、自我演绎。这是由文明互鉴的规律所决定的，是习近平文化思想的又一突出特质和重要理论线索。 深刻认识习近平文化思想对马克思主义文化理论的丰富发展 习近平文化思想是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的重要组成部分，构成习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的文化篇，在新时代中国特色社会主义发展历程和中国共产党文化理论发展史上都具有里程碑式的意义。习近平文化思想的提出突出了文化在党的理论创新中的重要地位和作用，进一步丰富了党的理论创新成果的内涵，标志着我们党对中国特色社会主义文化建设规律的认识达到了新高度，表明我们党的历史自信、文化自信达到了新高度。 习近平文化思想丰富发展了马克思主义文化理论，在马克思主义文化理论发展史上具有里程碑式的意义。习近平文化思想体现了对文化建设战略地位和作用的深刻把握，进一步巩固了马克思主义在意识形态领域的指导地位，是对马克思主义文化本质理论的丰富发展；内在包含关切人民美好生活需要的精神向度，追求满足人民文化需求、增强人民精神力量，是对马克思主义文化作用理论的丰富发展；深刻揭示了文化建设和文化传承发展规律，提出“第二个结合”是又一次的思想解放，是对马克思主义文明产生演进一般规律的创新发展；着力推动建设中华民族现代文明，创造人类文明新形态，开辟了中华民族现代文明新的发展空间，是对马克思主义文化发展进路的丰富发展。 习近平文化思想是新时代以来我们党文化建设理论创新和实践经验的系统总结，是新时代新征程上文化建设的科学理论指南。认真学习领会习近平文化思想，必须深刻把握习近平文化思想的时代背景和重大意义，坚持学以致用，自觉贯彻落实到宣传思想文化工作各方面全过程，谱写更为绚烂的新时代中国特色社会主义新的文化篇章。

Editor-in-Chief: Li Jiaqi 2024-01-18 16:37:01 0,"The National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology and Culture held in October 2023 formally put forward and systematically elaborated Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, marking the opening of the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping's Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Deepening the systematic construction and theoretical interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, and clarifying ""why it was put forward"", ""where it came from"" and ""where it is going"" are important for doing a good job of propaganda and ideological work in the new era and new journey, and for assuming new responsibilities. It is of great significance to clarify the ""why"", ""where"" and ""where"" of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, so as to do a good job of propaganda and ideology in the new era and the new journey, and to shoulder the new cultural mission. Comprehensively grasp the background and significance of Xi Jinping's cultural thought Xi Jinping's cultural thought marks a new level of understanding of the laws of cultural construction. Since the new era, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has proposed and promoted the comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, focused on promoting high-quality development, promoted the construction of a new development pattern, and consolidated the material foundation for the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country. However, the coordinated development of material civilization and spiritual civilization cannot be achieved naturally, which requires political parties, countries and nations in this era to deeply grasp their historical orientation and take the initiative to lead the development of the era from the level of cultural superstructure. Based on his profound understanding of the role of culture in social development, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward such original assertions as ""fully recognizing the extreme importance of ideological work,"" ""firming up cultural self-confidence, and building a strong socialist cultural country,"" forming Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought not only reflects the Party's adherence to the materialist conception of history, but also embodies the creative development of cultural theories, marking a new level of the Party's understanding of the laws and trends of cultural development in the current era. Xi Jinping's cultural thought continues the historical root of the Party's century-old cultural self-confidence and self-reliance. Since modern times, the Chinese nation has suffered unprecedented calamities as the country has been humiliated, the people have suffered, and civilization has been in the dust. Reflecting on and reshaping the traditional culture of the Chinese nation and searching for the future direction of Chinese culture and national spirit have become the deep-seated issues behind the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks. The founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) opened up a new path for the cultural construction and cultural self-confidence and self-empowerment of the Chinese nation. From the day of its founding, the CPC has made it its mission to build a new national, scientific and popular culture for the Chinese nation, and has put forward a program and proposition for building a new culture for the Chinese nation. During the period of socialist revolution and construction, Mao Zedong put forward the cultural policy of ""let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend,"" to promote the development of socialist science, technology and culture. After the reform and opening-up period, Deng Xiaoping put forward the idea of ""grasping with both hands and doing hard work with both hands"", highlighting the importance of cultural construction in the overall situation of the Party and the country, and laying a solid ideological and cognitive foundation for the construction of a strong socialist cultural country. Since the new era, socialist culture with Chinese characteristics has been developing and progressing, and the cultural competition among various countries has become more and more intense. In such an era, Xi Jinping's cultural thought has been put forward to generally cultivate and promote cultural self-confidence in the whole society, and to pass on the theoretical character of the Party's century-old cultural self-confidence and self-reliance, which is just in time and in the right situation. Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought focuses on the practical need to provide timely and scientific answers to the issues of the times. In June 2023, when presiding over the sixth collective study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""new issues of the times need to be answered in a timely and scientific manner,"" and emphasized that ""we are pushing forward with theoretical innovations on the basis of practice, rather than sitting in an ivory tower. It is emphasized that ""the theoretical innovations we promote are theories based on practice, not idle thoughts sitting in an ivory tower, and that we must insist on discovering and developing the truth in practice, and realizing and testing the truth with practice"". Xi Jinping's cultural thought is precisely the theoretical crystallization of the major problems of the times, such as focusing on the main contradictions, accurately grasping the voices of the times, and scientifically answering the questions of what kind of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is to be adhered to and developed in the new era, how to adhere to and develop socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, what kind of socialist cultural powerhouse is to be built, how to build a strong socialist cultural powerhouse, and what kind of modern civilization for the Chinese nation is to be constructed. It is the theoretical crystallization of the major issues of the times. On the new journey, the problems facing the construction of a strong cultural country are more complicated and the challenges are more arduous. In the great logic and trend of the development of our society and human society, we can more deeply appreciate the profound significance of Xi Jinping's cultural thought for the times and practice. Deeply Grasp the Historical Depth of the Formation and Development of Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought Comrade Xi Jinping showed a strong interest in Chinese classics, historical and cultural books, and classical Chinese poems when he was a young man, and these readings and reflections laid a solid foundation for him to form a profound understanding of and scientific attitude toward the outstanding traditional Chinese culture later on. During his work at the local level, Comrade Xi Jinping combined theory with practice, attached great importance to the protection, inheritance and development of history and culture, and physically promoted the protection of historical and cultural heritage. During his tenure as Secretary of Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee, Comrade Xi Jinping gave important instructions for the protection of the former residences of Lin Jiumin and Bingxin, personally presided over the promotion of the restoration project of the former residences, and also acted as a lecturer for the guests from outside the province at the Memorial Hall of the Xinhai Revolution in Fuzhou City. During his tenure as the acting governor of Fujian Province, in order to protect the prehistoric ruins known as ""Southern Zhoukoudian"" from being destroyed by mining, Comrade Xi Jinping made important instructions, clearly pointing out that the protection of historical relics is the responsibility of everyone under the national law, and is also an important part of the implementation of the sustainable development strategy. Wanshouyan Paleolithic Cave has been as a non-renewable and precious historical relic, which belongs not only to us, but also to the future generations, and no individual or unit can destroy the whole society and the future generations for the sake of seeking immediate or localized interests. These assertions and initiatives reflect Comrade Xi Jinping's profound historical insight and deep strategic vision to correctly treat historical and cultural traditions in the context of the development of history and the times. Comrade Xi Jinping has profoundly clarified the essential status of ideological work and the maintenance of ideological security. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, with the deepening of reform and opening up and the continuous development of the socialist market economy, the internal and external environments in which the Party is ruling have become increasingly severe and complex, and the Party is faced with the challenges of the ""four great tests"" and the ""four great dangers"" under the new situation, which have emphasized the extreme importance of strengthening the work of propaganda and ideology. This highlights the extreme importance of strengthening propaganda and ideological work. Against the background and climate of the times, propaganda and ideological work, as the primary front-line position, must be flagrantly launched in a positive struggle. 2013 National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work clearly pointed out the important position and significance of ideological work, and comprehensively and systematically elucidated the basic responsibilities, main connotations, missions and principles of propaganda and ideological work, which has provided a fundamental guideline for doing a good job of propaganda and ideological work for the Party in the new era. The Party's propaganda and ideological work in the new era has been provided with fundamental guidelines. For more than a decade, the Party has always placed propaganda and ideological work as an extremely important task in a prominent position, accumulated foundation and foundation, innovated and developed, and never relaxed the struggle in the field of ideology, vigorously safeguarding the country's political security and ideological security. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to strengthen cultural self-confidence and comprehensively promote cultural construction in the new era. To deeply understand the generation of the ""four self-confidence"" and the comprehensive advancement of cultural construction in the new era, it is necessary to grasp the unity of theoretical logic, historical logic and practical logic. self-confidence, is the proper meaning of firm road self-confidence, theoretical self-confidence and institutional self-confidence."" In May 2016, at a symposium on philosophical and social sciences work, General Secretary Xi Jinping talked about, ""When we say that we have to be firm in our confidence in the road, theory and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, in the final analysis we have to be firm in our cultural confidence. Cultural self-confidence is a more fundamental, deeper and more enduring force."" On July 1 of the same year, at a conference celebrating the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that ""cultural self-confidence is a more basic, broader, and deeper self-confidence,"" and emphasized that ""adherence to not forgetting the original intention and continuing to move forward is to adhere to the self-confidence of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, theoretical self-confidence, institutional self-confidence, and cultural self-confidence. system, and culture"". In the report of the 19th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed, ""Without a high degree of cultural confidence and the prosperity of culture, there will be no great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" The status and role of culture has become more and more prominent because in the historic leap of the Chinese nation to stand up, get rich and get strong, cultural confidence has a solid material foundation and a broader stage to play its role. In this process, the Party's understanding of the strategic position and role of culture and the laws of cultural construction has gradually risen to a new level, cultural confidence has become stronger, and cultural construction has achieved fruitful results. General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed at the conference celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China that the basic principles of Marxism should be combined with China's concrete realities and with China's excellent traditional culture, and at the symposium on the development of cultural inheritance, he explicitly put forward ""the second combination"" as yet another ideological emancipation, which has become a major assertion of landmark significance in Xi Jinping's cultural thought. It has become a landmark assertion in Xi Jinping's cultural thought. In the context of the ""two combinations"", ""combining the basic principles of Marxism with the excellent traditional Chinese culture"" is put forward as a derivative of the first combination, from combining with the reality of the country to combining with Chinese historical tradition and ideology and culture, which implies that the combination of Marxism and traditional Chinese culture is the most effective way to promote the Chineseization of Marxism for the times. The promotion of the modernization of Marxism has entered a new stage, a new field and a new realm, reflecting a new narrative perspective of the modernization of Marxism. General Secretary Xi Jinping's proposal of ""the second combination"" is another ideological liberation, which is put forward in response to the theoretical and practical problems of treating traditional culture wrongly or copying and reproducing the cultures of other countries, and it is a theoretical innovation within the cultural narrative system of the Chineseization of Marxism and the modernization of Marxism, which opens up a broader space for cultural development. It opens up a broader space for cultural development. Understanding the rich connotation and distinctive features of Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, as an ever-expanding and open system of thought, not only contains innovations in the theoretical viewpoints of culture, but also has clear and powerful deployment of cultural work, realizing the unity of epistemology and methodology, and serving as a scientific guide for the work of propaganda, ideology and culture in the new era and the new journey, marking a new high level of understanding of the laws of the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. The Party's understanding of the laws of socialist culture construction with Chinese characteristics has reached a new height. To strengthen the study, research and interpretation of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, it is necessary to grasp its main content as a whole, but also to make a theoretical generalization of its connotations and characteristics, deepen the doctrinal interpretation, and identify the ""soul vein"" of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, so as to better play the role of guiding and leading practice. Adhere to the dialectical unity of party nature and people's nature. Adhering to the dialectical unity of party nature and people's nature is an important theoretical summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural construction since the new era, and is a distinctive feature of Xi Jinping's cultural thought. Adherence to the dialectical unity of party nature and people's nature is fundamentally determined by the nature and purpose of the CPC and the relationship between the Party and the people, and must be persistently adhered to and implemented as a fundamental guideline for propaganda and ideological work. In response to the weakening of the Party's leadership in the ideological field, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed, ""We must strengthen the Party's overall leadership of propaganda and ideological work, and clearly adhere to the Party's control of propaganda and ideology."" In response to the question of ""who is in charge,"" ""how to be in charge,"" and ""what to be in charge"" of propaganda and ideological work, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""the media hosted by the Party and the government are the General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""the media sponsored by the Party and the government are the propaganda positions of the Party and the government, and must be named after the Party""; ""the core of adhering to the Party nature is to adhere to the correct political direction, stand firmly on the political stance, firmly publicize the Party's theories and routes, guidelines, and policies, firmly publicize the central government's major deployment, firmly publicize the central government's major analyses and judgments of the situation, and resolutely maintain a high degree of consistency with the Central Committee of the CPC, and resolutely maintain central authority."" With regard to literary and artistic work and philosophical and social scientific research, General Secretary Xi Jinping demanded that it is necessary to adhere to the people-centered orientation of work, to prosper the development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries, and to better satisfy the cultural needs of the people, emphasizing that artistic and literary creations should be rooted in the people and their lives, adhering to the service of the people and the socialism, resolving the fundamental question of why people, reflecting the nature and fundamental purposes of the Party, and creating more We should create more excellent works that are worthy of the times and the people. The party nature and people's nature of propaganda and ideological work depend on each other in theory and corroborate each other in practice, together drawing an extremely important thread in Xi's cultural thought. Adhere to the mutual promotion of historical inheritance and the development of the times. As the only ancient civilization in the world with an unbroken heritage, Chinese civilization has endured for thousands of years and suffered from repeated sorrows, but has never failed to flourish, thanks to the rich nourishment of China's excellent traditional culture. As the core and essence of Chinese civilization, the Chinese excellent traditional culture has accumulated the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese nation, represents the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation, and has played a positive role in the continuity and development of the Chinese nation and Chinese civilization. Attaching importance to the inheritance and development of traditional culture is an important content and distinctive quality of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, especially its new ideas, views and assertions on how Chinese civilization can achieve innovation and development in the new era, which are of far-reaching historical significance and contemporary value. On the one hand, it is important to adhere to the stance of Chinese culture, insist on observing the correctness and innovation, and promote the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese outstanding traditional culture with a scientific attitude. General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly summarized the five outstanding characteristics of Chinese civilization, namely continuity, innovation, unity, inclusiveness and peacefulness, revealing the fundamental source of cultural self-confidence, and emphasized the need to promote the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese outstanding traditional culture on the basis of a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of Chinese civilization, so as to promote the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics in a more powerful way. On the other hand, we should be firm in our cultural self-confidence, promote Chinese civilization into a new form with a new cultural mission, guide the direction of Chinese-style modernization, and provide developing countries with a new choice of civilization towards modernization. Adhere to the organic unity of cultural diversity and integration and cohesion. In today's Chinese society, diverse cultures and social trends are intertwined, with varying degrees of influence on the mainstream culture and ideology of the society, and how to consolidate and strengthen the mainstream ideology has become an important topic of cultural construction throughout. For more than a hundred years, the Party has always emphasized the use of culture to lead the people in the direction of advancement, and has gathered strength for the cause of revolution, construction and reform through the promotion of cultural construction. Since the new era, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has creatively put forward the fundamental system of adhering to the guiding position of Marxism in the field of ideology, ensuring at the institutional level that the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics advances along the correct direction and path, and greatly consolidating the common ideological basis for the unity of the whole Party and the whole nation. In the report of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping elaborated on the profound connotation of the ""two combinations,"" pointing out the fundamental way to modernize Marxism. At the Symposium on Cultural Inheritance and Development, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the ""second combination"" is another ideological emancipation, emphasizing that ""the result of the 'combination' is a mutual achievement, creating a new organically unified cultural life-form, making Marxism the basis of a common ideological foundation, and making Marxism the basis of a common ideological foundation. The result of the 'combination' is mutual achievement, creating a new organically unified cultural life form, making Marxism Chinese, the excellent traditional Chinese culture modern, and the new culture formed through the 'combination' the cultural form of Chinese-style modernization."" The cultural form of Chinese-style modernization itself contains a triple civilizational context, and is the result of the temporal and spatial convergence of Chinese civilization, modern civilization and socialist civilization. This fusion is an innovation in itself, not a simple physical addition, but an integration and cohesion in the chemical sense, so that a profound chemical reaction occurs between the ""soul"", ""root"" and multiple civilization contexts, which consolidates the cultural subjectivity, enhances the national cultural identity, and gives rise to a stronger national cultural identity. This will consolidate cultural subjectivity, enhance national cultural identity, and give rise to stronger national cohesion and centripetal force. Adhere to the cross-fertilization of self-centeredness and mutual understanding of civilizations. Chinese civilization has the genes of self-centeredness and eclecticism. Ancient Greek civilization, the Two Rivers Valley civilization, ancient Egyptian civilization, and ancient Indian civilization all declined due to colonization and foreign cultural invasion, and were eventually fragmented or even interrupted in the course of history. Only Chinese civilization has maintained its own cultural subjectivity and formed a pattern of pluralism and unity in the process of actively absorbing and integrating the outstanding achievements of foreign civilizations. From the perspective of the Party's century-long struggle, the Party has long recognized the need for ""self-centeredness"" in cultural construction. Entering the new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping has enriched and developed the principles and methods of cultural construction, proposing to insist that cultural development should be ""self-centered"", ""using foreign countries for Chinese purposes"" and ""dialectically choosing and choosing"", to strengthen the construction of international communication capacity, and to continuously enhance cultural soft power and the influence of Chinese culture. Accelerating the construction of philosophical and social sciences with Chinese characteristics and constructing China's autonomous knowledge system have clarified the noble mission of China's philosophical and social science workers in the new era. General Secretary Xi Jinping has always stood on the height of grasping the laws of the evolution of human civilization in examining and thinking about the inheritance and development of Chinese civilization, its dissemination to the outside world, and exchanges and mutual understanding. He emphasized that adhering to the principle of ""we are the master"" does not mean that we are the masters and exclude outsiders, but rather that we should exchange on an equal footing and learn from each other on the basis of respect for differences and understanding of individuality. Chinese civilization is an open system formed through continuous exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations, and exchange and mutual learning is an essential requirement for the development of civilization. Calling on all countries in the world to carry forward the common values of all mankind, such as peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, embodies a broad and open international vision. The more national a culture is, the more global it is. The new form of human civilization that socialism with Chinese characteristics seeks to create manifests itself as an open form of civilization capable of exchanges and mutual understanding, rather than as a solitary, self-interpretation. This is determined by the law of mutual appreciation of civilizations, and is another prominent quality and important theoretical clue of Xi Jinping's cultural thought. Deeply Understanding Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought's Enrichment and Development of Marxist Cultural Theory Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought is an important part of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, constitutes the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and is of milestone significance in the course of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and in the history of the CPC's cultural theory. The formulation of Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought highlights the important position and role of culture in the Party's theoretical innovations, further enriches the connotation of the Party's theoretical innovations, marks a new height in the Party's understanding of the laws governing the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, and indicates that the Party's historical and cultural self-confidence has reached a new height. Xi Jinping's cultural thought has enriched and developed Marxist cultural theory, and is of landmark significance in the history of the development of Marxist cultural theory. Xi Jinping's cultural thought embodies a profound grasp of the strategic position and role of cultural construction, further consolidates the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field, and is a rich development of the Marxist theory of the nature of culture; it inherently contains the spiritual orientation of concern for the people's need for a better life, and pursues the satisfaction of the people's cultural needs and the enhancement of the people's spiritual strength, and is a rich development of the Marxist theory of the role of culture; It profoundly reveals the laws of cultural construction and cultural inheritance and development, and proposes the ""second combination"" as another ideological liberation, which is an innovative development of the general law of the emergence and evolution of Marxist civilization; it focuses on promoting the construction of a modern civilization for the Chinese nation and the creation of a new form of human civilization, which opens up a new space for the development of a modern civilization for the Chinese nation, and is an innovative development of the Marxist theory of the progression of cultural development. It is a rich development of the Marxist approach to cultural development. Xi Jinping's cultural thought is a systematic summary of the Party's theoretical innovation and practical experience in cultural construction since the new era, and is a scientific theoretical guide for cultural construction in the new era and new journey. To study and understand Xi Jinping's cultural thought, we must deeply grasp the background and significance of the era of Xi Jinping's cultural thought, insist on applying what we have learned, consciously implement it in all aspects of propaganda and ideological and cultural work, and write a new cultural chapter of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era that is even more splendid. (The author is a researcher at the Xi Jinping Institute of Socialist Thought with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Renmin University of China)","The article discusses the significance and implications of Xi Jinping's Cultural Thought, introduced at the National Conference on Propaganda, Ideology, and Culture in October 2023.

The Party's historical experience shows that theoretical innovation is an important source of vitality for the Party, and the same is true for Party governance. From General Secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the 12th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform in May 2015, in which he first put forward the thesis of ""self-revolution"", to the report of the 20th Party Congress, in which he explicitly stated that ""the Party has found self-revolution, the second answer to the question of jumping out of the historical cyclical rate of governance and chaos.

拓展包容活跃的军事创新空间，在军事变革中掌握主动 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：胡建新 责任编辑：于雅倩 2024-01-18 07:19:38 0,拓展包容活跃的军事创新空间 ■胡建新 ●就军事而言，对创新的扼杀，就是对制胜机遇的错失 习主席在二〇二四年新年贺词中强调，要“拓展包容活跃的创新空间”。军事创新是提高军队战斗力的重要途径，是推进新军事革命的重要抓手，只有拓展包容活跃的军事创新空间，让更多创新成果脱颖而出，才能在风起云涌的军事变革中掌握主动、赢得先机。 军事创新需要海纳百川的包容环境。创新是一桩开拓性创造性很强的事业，没有现成路子可走，大都会经历这样那样的困难、障碍和挫折，不可能一帆风顺、一蹴而就。这就需要营造一个宽松包容的环境，鼓励各种新理念新观点新成果不断涌现、相互激荡，允许创新者出错、试错、改错。同时，又要放宽眼界、放远眼光，从容地将创新成果放到时间长河中去检验。 有正反两方面的历史经验值得借鉴。1878年，英军上校肯布拉里首创“装甲野战炮兵”理念，但被当时的英军领导人视为“异端邪说”而横加斥责。然而，到了1899年，德国军队却对肯布拉里的创见进行了一系列试验，形成了装甲机械化部队在空军支援下进行高度机动的进攻作战思想和相应作战计划。后来，德军把这些作战思想和计划运用于第二次世界大战，闪电般地袭击了整个欧洲，使肯布拉里的创见得以验证。无独有偶。第一次世界大战前，意大利将领朱里奥·杜黑预见到空军将在未来战场上发挥重要作用，提出夺取制空权理论，要求大力发展空军，但意大利统帅部不予理会。于是，杜黑致信陆军部，对意大利军队的作战方法和陆军总司令卡多尔恩提出尖锐批评。杜黑的直言换来的是被解除职务，送交军事法庭，判处一年监禁。直至意大利军队在卡波雷托之战中败北，事实证明杜黑的观点是正确的，杜黑才被释放。从上述事例中可以得出一个结论：对创新的扼杀，就是对制胜机遇的错失。 军事创新还需要争相参与的活跃气氛。创新本是灵动而超前的思维与实验活动，不活跃便无以创新。创新气氛一旦活跃起来，有助于立志创新者抛弃顾虑、丢掉包袱、轻装上阵，纵身投入创新大潮，勇敢点燃创新火花，竞相进入创新的前沿阵地和先进领域。这里尤需指出，思维决定思路，思路决定出路。创新首先应当是思维的创新，没有思维的创新就不会有思路的创新，也就不会有实际成果的创新。故而，要活跃创新空间，首先必须活跃思维空间，砥砺思维创新。 思维固化是思想僵化的前奏，而思想僵化则是战争失败的先兆。纵然是那些非常聪明、富有才华的军事天才，一旦染上因循守旧、蹈常袭故的毛病，也会很快被现实和历史淘汰。19世纪初奥地利统帅卡尔大公，曾在军事理论上做出过突出贡献，但后来他思想僵化，盲目相信战争原则永恒不变。就曾被《战争艺术史》一书的作者汉斯·德尔布吕克讽刺道：“他总是往后看，今天维也纳的卡尔大公骑马雕像就是这样的姿势。”揆诸历史与现实，许多新观念的萌生、新技术的发明、新武器的问世，无不滥觞于创新思维的涌动。未来战争是信息化智能化战争，战争形态、作战样式、战术战法等都将发生根本性变化。主动适应和推动这种变化，无疑需要更高层次、更具革命性意义的创新，思维创新对于今天准备战争的人们来说，显得格外重要。这就要求创新者在思维方式上进行突破，勇于从积淀着习惯思维的“板结层”中挣脱出来，创造出更多更新跨越式、压倒性乃至颠覆性的卓越成果。 “问渠哪得清如许，为有源头活水来。”拓展包容活跃的军事创新空间，关键在于倡导学术交锋，推动观点碰撞，淬炼思想火花，激励人们摆脱狭隘思维的束缚，开阔思维创新的视野，大力提升思维锐度、思想深度和创新维度，不断涌现新的理念、观点和实际成果。这样，就能在波谲云诡的时代之变中行稳致远，在风急浪高的军事竞争中稳操胜券。,https://web.archive.org/web/20240120000206/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16281206.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240120204702/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16281206.html,2024-01-20 0:00:00,"Expanding Inclusive and Active Military Innovation Space, Taking the Initiative in Military Transformation Source: china military net - liberation army newspaper Author: Hu Jianxin Responsibility: Yu Yaqian 2024-01-18 07:19:38 0","Expanding the space for inclusive and active military innovation ■ Hu Jianxin ● As far as the military is concerned, the stifling of innovation is a missed opportunity for victory President Xi emphasized in his New Year's message in 2024 that it is necessary to ""expand the space for inclusive and active innovation"". Military innovation is an important way to improve the combat effectiveness of the army, is to promote the new military revolution, only to expand the inclusive and active military innovation space, so that more innovative achievements stand out, in order to grasp the initiative in the upsurge of military change, win the first opportunity. Military innovation requires an inclusive environment. Innovation is a pile of pioneering creativity is very strong cause, there is no ready-made way to go, most will experience such and such difficulties, obstacles and setbacks, it is impossible to smooth sailing, overnight. This requires the creation of a loose and tolerant environment, encouraging a variety of new ideas and new perspectives and new results continue to emerge, mutual agitation, allowing innovators to make mistakes, trial and error, correction. At the same time, it is necessary to broaden the horizons, far vision, and comfortably put the results of innovation into the long river of time to test. There are both positive and negative historical experiences to learn from. 1878, the British Army Colonel Ken Braly first created the concept of ""armored field artillery"", but was regarded as ""heresy"" by the British military leaders at the time and rebuked. However, in 1899, the German army carried out a series of tests on Kemble's idea, and formed the idea of highly mobile offensive operations by armored mechanized forces with the support of air force and the corresponding battle plan. Later, the German army applied these operational ideas and plans to the Second World War, lightning attacked the whole of Europe, so that Kembrali's vision can be verified. There is no coincidence. Before the First World War, the Italian general Giulio Du Hei foresaw that the air force would play an important role in the future battlefield, put forward the theory of seizing the right to control the air, and asked to vigorously develop the air force, but the Italian Generalissimo paid no attention. As a result, Duhei wrote to the War Ministry, sharply criticizing the Italian army's combat methods and Army Commander-in-Chief Cadorne. Duhey's outspokenness was rewarded by being relieved of his duties, court-martialed and sentenced to one year's imprisonment. It was not until the Italian army was defeated at the Battle of Caporetto and Duhey's views were proved to be correct that Duhey was released. One conclusion can be drawn from the above examples: the stifling of innovation is a missed opportunity for victory. Military innovation also requires a vibrant atmosphere of competition for participation. Innovation is a dynamic and forward-thinking and experimental activities, not active will not be innovative. Once the innovation atmosphere is active, help those who aspire to innovation to abandon concerns, throw away the baggage, lightly loaded, plunged into the tide of innovation, bravely ignite the spark of innovation, competing to enter the cutting edge of innovation and advanced fields. Here especially need to point out that thinking determines thinking, thinking determines the way out. Innovation should be the first thinking of innovation, no thinking of innovation will not have the idea of innovation, there will be no practical results of innovation. Therefore, to active innovation space, must first active thinking space, sharpen thinking innovation. Thinking curing is the prelude to the rigidity of thought, while the rigidity of thought is the harbinger of the failure of the war. Even those who are very smart, talented military geniuses, once infected with the old-fashioned, the same old problems, will soon be reality and history out. 19th century Austrian commander-in-chief Archduke Karl, has made outstanding contributions to the military theory, but later his rigidity of thought, blindly believe that the principle of war is unchanging. On the author of the book ""History of the Art of War"" Hans Delbrück satirized: ""He always looked backward, and today's statue of Archduke Karl on horseback in Vienna is such a posture."" Considering history and reality, the emergence of many new concepts, the invention of new technologies, the introduction of new weapons, are all indiscriminately from the surge of innovative thinking. The future war is an information-intelligent war, war forms, combat styles, tactics and methods of warfare will undergo fundamental changes. Proactive adaptation and promote this change, undoubtedly need a higher level, more revolutionary significance of innovation, thinking innovation for today's people preparing for war, it is particularly important. This requires innovators to make breakthroughs in the way of thinking, the courage to break free from the accumulation of habitual thinking ""plate layer"", to create more newer leapfrog, overwhelming and even subversive excellent results. ""Ask where the canal can be cleared like this, for there is a source of living water to come."" Expanding the inclusive and active military innovation space, the key is to advocate academic exchanges, promote the collision of views, quenching the spark of thought, motivate people to get rid of the shackles of narrow thinking, broaden the horizons of thinking and innovation, vigorously enhance the sharpness of thinking, depth of thought and the dimension of innovation, and constantly emerge new ideas, views and practical results. In this way, we can make steady progress in the treacherous changes of the times and secure victory in the stormy military competition.","The expanding inclusive and active military innovation space is vital for the army to improve its combat effectiveness and promote the new military revolution. Military innovation requires an inclusive environment that encourages new ideas, perspectives, and results, as well as a vibrant atmosphere of competition for participation. Active thinking space and sharp thinking innovation are also necessary to have a higher level and more revolutionary significance of innovation to adapt to the fundamental changes in the future war. Advocating academic exchanges, promoting the collision of views, and constantly emerging new ideas, views, and practical results can help the army make steady progress in the treacherous changes of the times and secure victory in the stormy military competition."

画好强国建设民族复兴最大同心圆 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：邵刚 责任编辑：郭妍菲 2024-01-22 06:58:46 0,画好强国建设民族复兴最大同心圆 ■邵　刚 2023年12月29日，习主席在全国政协新年茶话会上指出，我们要巩固和发展最广泛的爱国统一战线，画好强国建设、民族复兴的最大同心圆，以团结凝聚力量，以奋斗铸就伟业，共同谱写中国式现代化的壮美华章。这个“同心圆”是指在党的领导下，动员全国各族人民，调动各方面积极性，共同为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。中国式现代化是强国建设、民族复兴的康庄大道，全党全军全国各族人民要坚定道路自信，在党的旗帜下团结成“一块坚硬的钢铁”，心往一处想、劲往一处使，努力画好强国建设、民族复兴的最大同心圆。 锚定最大同心圆的“圆心” 团结要有圆心，固守圆心才能上下齐心。“党政军民学，东西南北中，党是领导一切的。”画好强国建设、民族复兴的最大同心圆，关键是锚定中国共产党的领导这个圆心，始终坚持党中央集中统一领导。毛泽东同志指出：“没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。”同样，没有中国共产党的坚强领导，新时代爱国统一战线也是不可能巩固和发展的，国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福也是不可能实现的。 中国共产党作为中华儿女大团结大联合的圆心，是历史和人民的选择。近代中国内忧外患、积贫积弱，中华民族面临亡国灭种危机。为挽救民族危亡、实现民族振兴，无数仁人志士进行了可歌可泣的斗争，但均以失败告终。十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义，中国共产党应运而生，中国人民谋求民族独立、人民解放和国家富强、人民幸福的斗争就有了主心骨。抗日战争时期，党推动建立抗日民族统一战线，工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、海外华侨等，以不同形式参加了抗日民族统一战线，使抗日战争成为全民族的反侵略战争。解放战争时期，党在农村、在城市、在国民党军队中，团结一切可以团结的力量，建立最广泛的人民民主统一战线。新中国成立后，在党的领导下，新生的人民政权实现和巩固全国各族人民的大团结，实现和巩固全国工人、农民、知识分子和其他各阶层人民的大团结。改革开放以来，党紧紧团结各方力量，进一步发展和壮大由全体社会主义劳动者、社会主义事业的建设者、拥护社会主义的爱国者、拥护祖国统一和致力于中华民族伟大复兴的爱国者组成的最广泛的爱国统一战线，为民族复兴大业汇聚强大力量。新时代以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央着眼实现中华民族伟大复兴，坚持巩固和发展最广泛的爱国统一战线，团结带领人民披荆斩棘、勇往直前，采取一系列战略性举措，推进一系列变革性实践，实现一系列突破性进展，取得一系列标志性成果，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，我国发展具备了更为坚实的物质基础、更为完善的制度保证、更为主动的精神力量，迎来了民族复兴的光明前景。 “风雨多经志弥坚，关山初度路犹长。”今天，我们比历史上任何时期都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴。但我们也必须清醒地认识到，前进道路上不会一帆风顺，将面对风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验。只有始终坚持党的全面领导，坚决维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，始终同党中央保持高度一致，才能实现全党全军全国各族人民思想上的统一、政治上的团结、行动上的一致，才能实现中华民族伟大复兴的宏伟目标。 延展最大同心圆的“半径” 团结就是力量，团结才能前进。团结的面越广，团结的人越多，形成的力量就越大，我们的事业就越能无往而不胜。“乘众人之智，则无不任也；用众人之力，则无不胜也。”在新的赶考之路上，我们还将面临各种可以预见和难以预见的阻力和压力。越是在这样的时候，越是要调动一切可以调动的积极因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，不断延展最大同心圆的“半径”，形成同心共筑中国梦的强大合力。 用共同的目标凝聚人心和力量。在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举爱国主义、社会主义旗帜，牢牢把握大团结大联合的主题，把实现强国建设、民族复兴作为目标方向，充分激发全体人民的积极性主动性创造性，在共同的目标下统一思想、统一意志、统一步调，向着第二个百年奋斗目标奋勇前进，使强国建设、民族复兴的宏伟蓝图一步步变成美好现实。 正确处理一致性和多样性关系。着力增强一致性，把加强思想政治引领、广泛凝聚共识放在更加突出的位置，促进政党关系、民族关系、宗教关系、阶层关系、海内外同胞关系和谐，进一步巩固和发展最广泛的爱国统一战线，努力做好求同存异、聚同化异的工作，充分发扬民主、尊重包容差异，不断巩固已有共识、推动形成新的共识。要铸牢中华民族共同体意识，在尊重多样性中寻求一致性，找到最大公约数、画出最大同心圆，形成海内外全体中华儿女心往一处想、劲往一处使的生动局面，汇聚起实现民族复兴的磅礴力量。 凝聚画好最大同心圆的“合力” 画好最大同心圆需要每一位“执笔人”的共同参与和精心描摹。要实现强国建设、民族复兴，就必须保证“圆周”上的每一个点，都能始终指向“圆心”、围绕“圆心”发力。 “历尽天华成此景，人间万事出艰辛。”过去的一年，是全面贯彻落实党的二十大精神的开局之年，是充满考验和挑战的一年。以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚持运用发挥统一战线这个党克敌制胜、执政兴国的重要法宝，团结带领全党全军全国各族人民撸起袖子、迎难而上、攻坚拔寨，顶住外部压力、克服内部困难，交出了一份沉甸甸、分量足的高质量发展“中国答卷”。我们在化危机、闯难关、应变局中创造了新机遇、赢得了战略主动，为创造新辉煌增强了底气、提升了信心、积蓄了动能，绘就了波澜壮阔的时代画卷。这些成绩的取得，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导的结果，是党和人民一道拼出来、干出来的。 当前，世界百年未有之大变局加速演进，国际力量对比深刻调整，单边主义、保护主义、霸权主义和强权政治对世界和平发展威胁增长，世界进入动荡变革期，不稳定不确定因素显著增多。我国和平发展必然要面对越来越多的外部风险，面临问题的复杂程度、解决问题的艰巨程度明显加大，迫切需要凝聚起最广泛的共识，调动起最深层的力量，凝聚画好最大同心圆的“合力”，做好与各种风险挑战作斗争的准备。前进道路上，只要我们发挥好统一战线这一重要法宝的作用，凝聚起亿万人民一往无前之勇、应变求变之智、攻坚克难之力，就没有任何人能迟滞我们的脚步，就没有任何力量能阻挡我们向既定目标前进，就一定能依靠顽强斗争打开事业发展新天地，创造出令人刮目相看的新奇迹。 强国必先强军，军强才能国安。“强国建设、民族复兴的接力棒，历史地落在我们这一代人身上。”人民军队作为保卫红色江山、维护民族尊严的坚强柱石，必须在党的绝对领导下，进一步激发精神状态，凝聚奋进力量，为实现党在新时代的强军目标、把人民军队全面建成世界一流军队勇毅前行，为画好强国建设、民族复兴的最大同心圆提供更加坚强的战略支撑。 （作者单位：陆军军事交通学院）,https://web.archive.org/web/20240122235946/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16282147.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240122094057/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16282147.html,2024-01-23 0:00:00,Drawing the largest concentric circles for the construction of a strong nation and national revival Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Shao Gang Editor-in-Chief: Guo Yanfei 2024-01-22 06:58:46 0,"Drawing the Greatest Concentric Circle for the Construction of a Strong Nation and National Rejuvenation ■ Shao Gang On December 29, 2023, at the New Year's Tea Party of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), President Xi pointed out that we have to consolidate and develop the widest patriotic united front, draw the greatest concentric circle for the construction of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the nation, unite the strengths with unity, and forge greatness with struggles to jointly write the magnificent chapter of the Chinese style of modernization. This ""concentric circle"" refers to mobilizing people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and jointly striving for the realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Chinese-style modernization is the road to national construction and national rejuvenation, the whole Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups should be firm and confident in the road, united under the banner of the Party as ""a piece of hard steel"", the heart of one mind, strength to one place, and strive to draw the largest concentric circles of national construction and national rejuvenation. Anchor the largest concentric circle of the ""center of the circle"" unity to have a center of the circle, solid center of the circle in order to be united up and down. ""The Party, the government, the military, the people, the east, the west, the south, the north and the south, the Party is the leader of everything."" Drawing the largest concentric circle of the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation, the key is to anchor the leadership of the Communist Party of China as the center of the circle, and always adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, ""Without the strong leadership of the CPC, no revolutionary united front can be victorious."" Similarly, without the strong leadership of the CPC, it is impossible to consolidate and develop the patriotic united front in the new era, and it is impossible to realize the country's wealth and strength, the nation's revitalization, and the people's happiness. It is the choice of history and the people that the CPC serves as the center of the circle of great unity and solidarity of the children of China. In recent times, China has suffered from internal and external troubles, accumulated poverty and weakness, and the Chinese nation is facing the crisis of extinction of the country and the destruction of the race. In order to save the nation from peril and realize national revitalization, countless men of benevolence and aspiration carried out a glorious struggle, but all of them ended in failure. With the October Revolution, Marxism-Leninism was sent to China, and the Communist Party of China (CPC) came into being, giving the Chinese people a backbone in their struggle for national independence, liberation of the people, and the prosperity and happiness of the country. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the Party promoted the establishment of a national united front against Japanese aggression, in which the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and the overseas Chinese participated in different forms, thus making the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression a war of anti-aggression for the whole nation. During the War of Liberation, the Party rallied all the forces that could be united in the countryside, in the cities, and in the Kuomintang army to establish the broadest people's democratic united front. After the founding of New China, under the leadership of the Party, the nascent people's power realized and consolidated the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, as well as the unity of workers, peasants, intellectuals and other people of all classes throughout the country. Since the reform and opening-up, the Party has tightly united the forces of all sides, further developing and expanding the broadest patriotic united front comprising all socialist workers, builders of socialist undertakings, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who support the unification of the motherland and are committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, thus gathering powerful forces for the cause of national rejuvenation. Since the new era, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has focused on realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, adhered to the consolidation and development of the broadest patriotic united front, united and led the people to overcome the thorny obstacles and forge ahead, adopted a series of strategic initiatives, pushed forward a series of transformative practices, realized a series of breakthroughs, and achieved a series of landmark results, resulting in the Party and the country's cause making historic achievements and changes, and the development of our country having a more solid foundation. The Party and the national cause have made historic achievements and changes, and the development of our country has a more solid material foundation, a more perfect system to ensure that the spirit of more initiative, ushering in a bright prospect of national rejuvenation. ""The will is strong after many storms, and the road is still long at the beginning of the journey."" Today, we are closer to, more confident in and more capable of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history. But we must also soberly realize that the road ahead will not be smooth, will face high winds and waves or even shocking waves of major tests. Only by adhering to the overall leadership of the Party, resolutely safeguarding the authority and centralized leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and always maintaining a high degree of consistency with the CPC Central Committee, can we realize the unity of thought, political unity, and unanimity of action of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole nation, and achieve the grand goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Extending the radius of the largest concentric circle Unity is strength, and unity is the only way to move forward. The wider the unity, the more people united, the greater the power formed, the more our cause will be invincible. ""If we ride on the wisdom of all, we can do nothing; if we use the strength of all, we can do nothing."" On the new road of catching up, we will also face all kinds of foreseeable and unforeseeable resistance and pressure. The more at such a time, the more to mobilize all the positive factors that can be mobilized, unite all the forces that can be united, and continue to extend the ""radius"" of the largest concentric circle, to form a strong synergy to build the Chinese dream with one heart. The common goal is to unite people's hearts and strength. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, holding high the banners of patriotism and socialism, firmly grasping the theme of great unity and coalition, and taking the realization of the construction of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the nation as the target direction, we will fully stimulate the positivity, initiative and creativity of the entire people, unify our thoughts, wills and paces under the common goal, and move forward towards the second hundred years of the struggle to make the construction of a strong nation, The grand blueprint for national rejuvenation will be turned into a beautiful reality step by step. Correctly handle the relationship between consistency and diversity. Efforts should be made to enhance consistency, give more prominence to strengthening ideological and political leadership and broadly forging consensus, promote harmonious relations among political parties, ethnic groups, religions, social strata, and compatriots at home and abroad, further consolidate and develop the widest possible patriotic united front, strive to do a good job in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and gather common ground while dissimilarities are dissimilarities, fully carry forward democracy, respect and tolerate differences, and continuously consolidate the consensus that has already been reached, and push for the formation of a new consensus. We will continue to consolidate existing consensus and promote the formation of new consensus. We should forge a strong sense of community among the Chinese nation, seek consistency in respecting diversity, find the largest common denominator, draw the largest concentric circles, form a vivid situation in which all Chinese people at home and abroad think and work together, and gather the majestic strength to realize national rejuvenation. Cohesion to draw the largest concentric circles of ""synergy"" Drawing the largest concentric circles requires the joint participation and careful tracing of each ""penman"". To realize the construction of a strong country, national rejuvenation, it is necessary to ensure that every point on the ""circumference"" can always point to the ""center of the circle"", around the ""center of the circle"" force. ""After all these years, everything on earth has been difficult."" The past year is the opening year of the comprehensive implementation of the spirit of the twentieth CPC National Congress, a year full of tests and challenges. The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core insisted on utilizing the united front, which is an important magic weapon for the Party to overcome the enemy and to govern the country, united and led the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to roll up their sleeves, rise to the challenge, and pull out the strongholds, and withstood the external pressures and overcame the internal difficulties, handed over a heavy and sufficiently important ""China's Answer"" on high-quality development. We have delivered a ""China's answer"" of high-quality development with a heavy weight and sufficient weight. We have created new opportunities and won the strategic initiative in the midst of crisis, difficulties and changes, and have strengthened our confidence and built up kinetic energy to create new splendor, painting a magnificent picture of the times. These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and it is the Party and the people who work together and work out. At present, the world's century-old changes are accelerating, the international balance of power has been profoundly adjusted, unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony and power politics threaten the world's peace and development, the world has entered a period of turbulence and change, and there is a significant increase in unstable and uncertain factors. The peaceful development of our country is bound to face more and more external risks, and the complexity of the problems we face and the difficulty of solving them have increased significantly, so there is an urgent need to build up the broadest consensus, mobilize the deepest strength, and build up the ""synergy"" to draw the largest concentric circles, so as to be ready to fight against all kinds of risks and challenges. On the way forward, as long as we play the role of the united front as an important legal treasure, and gather hundreds of millions of people's courage to move forward, the wisdom to adapt to changes, and the strength to overcome difficulties, there is no one who can slow down our pace, and there is no force that can stop us from advancing towards the established goals, we will be able to rely on the tenacious struggle to open up new horizons of career development, and to create impressive new wonders. A strong country must first strengthen the army, and a strong army is necessary for national security. ""The baton of building a strong nation and national rejuvenation historically falls on our generation."" The people's army, as a strong pillar for defending the red rivers and mountains and safeguarding the dignity of the nation, must, under the absolute leadership of the Party, further stimulate the spirit and gather the power of advancement, so as to realize the Party's goal of a strong army in the new era, build the people's army into a world-class army in all respects, and provide stronger strategic support for drawing the largest concentric circles of strong nation building and national rejuvenation.

走符合中国实际情况的反恐人权保障道路 来源：人民日报 作者：李昌林 责任编辑：李佳琦 2024-01-25 19:32:28 0,中国在长期的反恐立法与实践中，正确处理反恐与人权保障的关系，坚持依法反恐、惩防结合、标本兼治、宽严相济、禁止歧视，既通过反恐保障人权，又在反恐过程中尊重和保障人权，形成了符合中国实际情况的反恐人权保障道路。 一是把保障人权作为反恐工作的根本目的。通过反恐保障人权和在反恐过程中保障人权，是反恐中人权保障不可分割的两个方面。一方面，反恐本身就是保障人权。恐怖主义活动严重侵犯人权。依法反恐，就是为了保障所有人包括生命权、健康权、财产权、发展权在内的一系列基本人权的正义事业。另一方面，中国坚持在反恐过程中尊重和保障人权。通过反恐保障人权和在反恐过程中保障人权，是一体两面的，二者不可偏废。既不能借口反恐侵犯人权，也不能以保障人权为由妨碍反恐工作的顺利进行。 二是坚持依法反恐。只有将反恐工作纳入法治轨道，才能既通过反恐保障人权，又在反恐过程中保障人权。为此，中国积极响应联合国全球反恐战略，签署或加入了多项联合国反恐公约，并签署了多项双边或多边反恐公约、条约，制定、完善了刑法、刑事诉讼法、反恐怖主义法、国家安全法等法律，制定、完善了配套行政法规、部门规章、地方性法规，发布了相关司法解释，构建了以宪法为根本，法律、行政法规、部门规章、地方性法规、法律解释等组成的反恐法律制度体系。中国执法司法机关在办理恐怖活动违法、犯罪案件中，严格执法，公正司法，尊重和保障人权，坚守正当程序，恪守客观公正义务，落实办案责任，强化权力制约和权力监督，实现了反恐权力规范有序运行，做到既通过反恐保障人权，又在反恐过程中保障人权。 三是坚持防范为主、惩防结合。恐怖活动组织和人员往往采取暴力、破坏、恐吓等手段来实现其罪恶目的。恐怖活动一旦得逞，即便恐怖活动组织和人员最终受到法律制裁，其对广大人民群众的生命、健康、财产安全造成的损失也难以挽回。为此，中国在反恐工作中，坚持防范为主。在安全防范的基础上，对恐怖活动犯罪依法及时予以严厉打击。安全防范和惩治犯罪是反恐工作的一体两面。加强安全防范，有助于及时发现恐怖活动组织、恐怖活动人员及其实施恐怖活动的阴谋，及时予以惩治。依法及时惩治恐怖活动犯罪，既有助于通过发挥刑罚的特殊预防功能，打击恐怖活动组织和恐怖活动人员的嚣张气焰，也有助于发挥刑罚的一般预防功能，警戒不稳定分子参加恐怖活动组织或参与恐怖活动，还可以鼓励广大人民群众积极提供线索，筑牢防恐安全防线。 四是坚持宽严相济。对于恐怖活动，一味强调严刑峻法，不但不利于涉恐人员的改造，而且也不利于增强社会大众对行政处罚、司法裁判的认同感。因此，中国法律秉持宽严相济刑事政策，根据行为的社会危害性大小，将其区分为违法行为和犯罪行为。只有社会危害性较大、应受刑罚处罚的恐怖活动才构成犯罪。对情节轻微尚不构成犯罪的违法行为，按照反恐怖主义法等法律予以行政处罚。执法、司法机关在办理恐怖活动案件过程中，进一步贯彻宽严相济刑事政策。对于虽然构成犯罪，但犯罪情节轻微，依照刑法规定不需要判处刑罚或者免除刑罚的，人民检察院可以作出不起诉决定，人民法院可以判决免予刑事处罚。对于被判处拘役、三年以下有期徒刑的犯罪分子，如果其犯罪情节较轻，有悔罪表现，没有再犯罪的危险，宣告缓刑对所居住社区没有重大不良影响的，人民法院可以宣告缓刑。 （作者为西南政法大学人权研究院教授）,https://web.archive.org/web/20240125235757/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16283038.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240125123853/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16283038.html,2024-01-26 0:00:00,Taking the path of human rights protection against terrorism in line with China's actual situation Source: People's Daily Author: Li Changlin Editor-in-chief: Li Jiaqi 2024-01-25 19:32:28 0,"In its long-standing counter-terrorism legislation and practice, China has correctly dealt with the relationship between counter-terrorism and human rights safeguards, adhering to the law in counter-terrorism, combining punishment and prevention, treating both the symptoms and the root causes of the problem, applying both leniency and severity, and prohibiting discrimination; not only does it safeguard human rights through counter-terrorism, but it also respects and safeguards human rights in counter-terrorism, thus forming a path for safeguarding human rights in counter-terrorism that is consistent with the actual situation in China. First, safeguarding human rights is the fundamental purpose of counter-terrorism efforts. Safeguarding human rights through counter-terrorism and safeguarding human rights in the process of counter-terrorism are two inseparable aspects of safeguarding human rights in counter-terrorism. On the one hand, counter-terrorism itself is the safeguarding of human rights. Terrorist activities seriously violate human rights. Counter-terrorism, in accordance with the law, is a just cause to safeguard a series of basic human rights for all, including the right to life, health, property and development. On the other hand, China insists on respecting and safeguarding human rights in the process of counter-terrorism. Safeguarding human rights through counter-terrorism and safeguarding human rights in the process of counter-terrorism are two sides of the same coin, and the two cannot be neglected. Neither can human rights be violated under the pretext of counter-terrorism, nor can the protection of human rights be used as an excuse to impede the smooth progress of counter-terrorism work. Secondly, we must adhere to the rule of law in countering terrorism. Only by incorporating counter-terrorism into the rule of law can human rights be safeguarded not only through counter-terrorism, but also in the process of counter-terrorism. To this end, China has actively responded to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, signed or acceded to a number of United Nations counter-terrorism conventions, and signed a number of bilateral or multilateral counter-terrorism conventions and treaties; it has enacted and perfected such laws as the Criminal Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Counter-Terrorism Law, and the National Security Law, and has formulated and perfected complementary administrative laws and regulations, departmental regulations, and local laws and regulations, as well as issued relevant judicial interpretations, and has constructed a system that is based on the Constitution as the fundamental basis. This has resulted in the construction of a legal system for combating terrorism that is based on the Constitution and comprises laws, administrative regulations, departmental regulations, local regulations and legal interpretations. In handling cases involving violations and crimes related to terrorist activities, China's law enforcement and judicial organs strictly enforce the law, administer justice impartially, respect and safeguard human rights, adhere to due process, abide by the obligation of objectivity and impartiality, implement their responsibilities for handling cases, strengthen power constraints and power supervision, and realize the standardized and orderly functioning of counter-terrorism powers, so as to safeguard human rights not only through counter-terrorism, but also during the process of counter-terrorism. Thirdly, it has insisted that prevention is the mainstay and that punishment and prevention are combined. Terrorist organizations and individuals often resort to violence, sabotage, intimidation and other means to achieve their evil purposes. Once a terrorist activity succeeds, even if the terrorist organization or individual is ultimately punished by the law, the damage done to the lives, health and property of the general public will be difficult to undo. For this reason, in its counter-terrorism efforts, China insists that prevention is the mainstay of its work. On the basis of security precautions, crimes of terrorist activity are dealt with severely and in a timely manner in accordance with the law. Prevention and punishment are two sides of the same coin. Strengthening security precautions helps to detect terrorist organizations, terrorists and their plots to carry out terrorist activities in a timely manner, and to punish them in a timely manner. Timely punishment of terrorist crimes in accordance with the law not only helps to combat the arrogance of terrorist organizations and personnel by giving full play to the special preventive function of penalties, but also helps to give full play to the general preventive function of penalties by warning unstable elements to join terrorist organizations or participate in terrorist activities, and also encourages the general public to actively provide clues to build up a solid anti-terrorist security line. Fourthly, we insist on leniency and severity. In the case of terrorist activities, a single-minded emphasis on harsh penalties is not only detrimental to the rehabilitation of those involved in terrorist activities, but also to the enhancement of the public's sense of acceptance of administrative penalties and judicial decisions. For this reason, Chinese law upholds a criminal policy of balancing leniency with severity, distinguishing between unlawful acts and criminal acts according to the degree of social harm of the act. Only terrorist activities that are socially dangerous and punishable by criminal penalties constitute crimes. Violations of the law that are minor and do not yet constitute crimes are subject to administrative penalties in accordance with the Counter-Terrorism Act and other laws. In handling cases of terrorist activities, law enforcement and judicial authorities further implement the criminal policy of mutual leniency. For those who, although constituting a crime, have committed a minor offense and do not need to be sentenced or exempted from punishment in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law, the people's procuratorate may make a decision not to prosecute, and the people's court may rule that they are exempted from criminal punishment. For criminals sentenced to detention or fixed-term imprisonment of less than three years, the people's court may pronounce a suspended sentence if the circumstances of the crime are minor, they show remorse for the crime, there is no danger of committing another crime, and the pronouncement of a suspended sentence will not have a significant adverse effect on the community in which they live. (The author is a professor at the Human Rights Research Institute of Southwest University of Political Science and Law)","China has a path for safeguarding human rights in counter-terrorism that is consistent with its actual situation. This path includes safeguarding human rights as the fundamental purpose of counter-terrorism efforts, adhering to the rule of law in countering terrorism, combining punishment and prevention, and applying both leniency and severity.

形象在行动中树立，高标准严要求成就好形象 来源：中国军网-解放军报 作者：王  悦 责任编辑：于雅倩 2024-01-25 07:00:40 0,高标准严要求成就好形象 ■王  悦 ●形象在行动中树立，在行动中坚持高标准严要求，会对自身形象产生潜移默化、深远持久的影响 近日，一条关于哨兵的短视频在网上引起关注。身处祖国最北端哨位上的两名哨兵面对零下几十摄氏度的严寒，长时间保持纹丝不动，让游客们一度以为他们是“仿真人”。为了验证答案，有人上前敬礼，两人立即脱下手套回礼。“是真的！”这一场景让无数网友感动，并在评论区留言对中国军人表达敬意。在严寒环境中，战士们对自己高标准严要求，以实际行动展示出中国军人的好形象。由此，我们可以悟出一个道理，有什么样的标准要求，就会有什么样的形象，高标准严要求成就好形象。 形象在行动中树立，在行动中坚持高标准严要求，会对自身形象产生潜移默化、深远持久的影响。一个人在工作中坚持高标准严要求，做事认真负责，他在领导和同事眼中就是一个靠谱的人；一名党员干部在廉洁方面严格要求自己，坚持干干净净用权，清清爽爽做人，就能树立起清正廉明的形象。作为集体的一员，我们的行为不仅影响自身，也会影响外界对集体的看法和印象。高标准严要求可以造就好作风，进而树立和维护个人、集体的良好形象，反之亦然。近日获得“时代楷模”称号的海军南昌舰党委，始终把“第一”作为目标，让追求“一流战舰、一流标准、一流事业”成为官兵的行动自觉，多次圆满完成重大任务，将人民海军新质作战力量能打仗、打胜仗的战斗作风和精神风貌充分展现出来。广大官兵如果都能主动在工作实践中坚持高标准严要求，就能在提升自我、成就事业的同时，让中国军人和人民军队的良好形象深入人心。 高标准严要求源于远大志向追求。工作标准的高低、要求的严松，取决于如何看待这份工作。有的人抱着应付心态，满足于能交差就行，工作时标准要求自然只停留在“及格线”；而有的人心怀大志，将工作当成值得为之奋斗终生的事业，就会严格要求自己，将标准要求定在“优秀线”。只有拥有远大志向追求，将其与自身工作结合，才能迸发出源源不断的动力，以高标准严要求在工作中树立奋进形象，持续取得进步，最终成就事业。奥斯特洛夫斯基笔下的保尔·柯察金之所以能够以高标准严要求对待组织交给自己的任务，成为大家眼中“钢铁一样的人”，就是因为他将其视为“为人类的解放而斗争”这一“世界上最壮丽的事业”。广大官兵应当树立报国强军的志向追求，将其体现到对待工作的高标准严要求上，在不懈奋斗中跑出加速度，立起好形象。 高标准严要求是责任心的体现。毛泽东同志说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”最讲认真就是最有责任心，只有这样，才能以最高标准严格要求自己。倘若责任心不足，认为工作不需要自己那么尽职尽责，就算出了事也会有人顶在前面，就会持续降低对自己的要求，成为领导和同事眼中“没有担当的人”，也会给单位和集体形象带来负面影响。我军自诞生以来，一代代官兵始终把对党、对国家、对人民的责任扛在肩上，忠实履行党和人民赋予的使命任务，共同树立和维护了中国军人对党忠诚、勇于担当的良好形象。广大官兵奋进强军新征程，应当学习革命先辈的优秀精神品质，自觉将岗位当战位，不断以责任心强化高标准严要求，在攻坚克难中主动担责，在平凡中铸就非凡。 高标准严要求需要在实践中遵循。空有高标准严要求，没有与之相对应的实际行动，就会使其失去意义，必须将其内化于心的同时外化于行。一方面，要磨砺顽强意志。高标准严要求从来不是轻轻松松就可以做到的，必定伴随着困难痛苦、失败挫折，只有拥有顽强意志，才能像哨兵挑战严寒那样，在克服困难中赢得好形象。须摒弃畏难退缩心态，主动迎接困难挑战，不惧失败，从挫折中收获成长养分。要发扬艰苦奋斗精神，积极投身强军实践，敢于“自找苦吃”，多经风雨、见世面，在斗争中磨砺意志品质。另一方面，要做到持之以恒。好形象不是一天树立的，一以贯之地坚持高标准严要求，才会有好形象。广大官兵应自觉培养标准意识和形象意识，从点滴小事做起，让高标准严要求成为一种习惯。如此方能立起好形象，把自己锻造成一名让组织信任、让战友认可的合格革命军人。,https://web.archive.org/web/20240125235757/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16282944.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20240125075422/http://www.81.cn/ll_208543/16282944.html,2024-01-26 0:00:00,"Image is established in action, high standards and strict requirements to achieve a good image Source: China Military Network - PLA Daily Author: Wang Yue Editor-in-Chief: Yu Yaqian 2024-01-25 07:00:40 0","High standards and strict requirements to achieve a good image ■ Wang Yue ● image in action to establish, in action to adhere to high standards and strict requirements, will have a subtle, far-reaching and long-lasting impact on their own image Recently, a short video about the sentry online attention. The two sentries at the northernmost post in the motherland face the cold of dozens of degrees below zero Celsius, keeping motionless for a long time, so that tourists once thought they were ""simulation"". In order to verify the answer, someone came forward to salute, the two immediately took off their gloves to return the salute. ""It's true!"" This scene touched countless netizens, who left messages in the comments section to pay tribute to the Chinese soldiers. In the bitterly cold environment, the soldiers held themselves to high standards and strict requirements, demonstrating the good image of Chinese soldiers with practical actions. From this, we can realize a truth, what kind of standard requirements, there will be what kind of image, high standards and strict requirements to achieve a good image. Image in action to establish, in action to adhere to high standards and strict requirements, will have a subtle, far-reaching and lasting impact on their own image. A person in the work adhere to high standards and strict requirements, do things seriously and responsibly, he is in the eyes of the leadership and colleagues is a reliable person; a party member and cadres in the integrity of strict requirements for their own, adhere to the clean use of power, refreshing to do, can set up a clean and honest image. As a member of the collective, our behavior not only affects itself, but also affects the outside world on the collective view and impression. High standards and strict requirements can create a good style, and then establish and maintain a good image of the individual, the collective, and vice versa. Recently won the ""model of the times"" title of the naval party committee of the Nanchang ship, always ""first"" as the goal, so that the pursuit of ""first-class warships, first-class standards, first-class cause"" has become the officers and men of the action consciously, many successful completion of major missions, the first-class standard, first-class cause. The Party Committee of Nanchang has always taken ""first"" as its goal, making the pursuit of ""first-class warships, first-class standards and first-class career"" a conscious action of the officers and soldiers, and has successfully accomplished major tasks many times, fully displaying the fighting style and spirit of the People's Navy's new combat force that is capable of winning battles. If the majority of officers and soldiers can take the initiative to adhere to high standards and strict requirements in their work practices, they will be able to improve themselves and accomplish their careers, while at the same time letting the good image of the Chinese soldiers and the People's Armed Forces take root in the hearts of the people. High standards and strict requirements stem from the pursuit of lofty aspirations. The high and low standards of work, the requirements of the strict and loose, depending on how to look at the work. Some people hold a coping mentality, satisfied with the ability to deliver on the line, the work of the standard requirements naturally only stay in the ""passing line""; and some people have great aspirations, the work as a cause worth fighting for the rest of their lives, will be strict on their own, will be required to set the standard requirements in the ""excellent line "". Only have a great ambition to pursue, will be combined with their own work, in order to burst out of a steady stream of power, with high standards and strict requirements in the work of setting up the image of progress, and continue to make progress, and ultimately achieve the cause. Ostrovsky's Paul Kochagin is able to treat the organization's tasks with high standards and strict requirements, and become a ""man of steel"" in everyone's eyes, because he regarded it as ""the struggle for the liberation of mankind"", which is the ""most magnificent and beautiful work in the world"", and ""the most magnificent work in the world"". ""The most magnificent cause in the world"". The majority of officers and soldiers should set up the pursuit of the ambition of serving the country and strengthening the military, will be reflected in the high standards and strict requirements to treat the work, in the unremitting struggle to run out of acceleration, set up a good image. High standards and strict requirements is the embodiment of responsibility. Comrade Mao Zedong said: ""The world is afraid of 'serious' word, the Communist Party is the most 'serious'."" The most conscientious is the most sense of responsibility, and only in this way can we hold ourselves to the highest standards. If the sense of responsibility is not enough, that the work does not need to be so conscientious, even if something goes wrong, someone will be in front, will continue to reduce their own requirements, become the leadership and colleagues in the eyes of the ""no bearer"", but also to the unit and the collective image of a negative impact. Since the birth of our army, generations of officers and soldiers have always put the party, the country, the people's responsibility on their shoulders, and faithfully fulfill the mission entrusted by the party and the people, together to establish and maintain the Chinese military loyalty to the party, the courage to play a good image. The majority of officers and soldiers into the new march of the army, should learn the outstanding spiritual qualities of the revolutionary forefathers, consciously post as a battlefield, constantly strengthen the high standards of strict requirements with a sense of responsibility, take the initiative to take responsibility for overcoming the difficulties, in the ordinary cast extraordinary. High standards and strict requirements need to be followed in practice. Empty high standards and strict requirements, no corresponding practical action, will make it lose its meaning, must be internalized in the heart at the same time externalized in the line. On the one hand, to sharpen the tenacious will. High standards and strict requirements is never easy to do, must be accompanied by difficulties and pain, failure and frustration, only with a strong will to challenge the cold like a sentry, in overcoming difficulties to win a good image. Must abandon the fear of retreat mentality, take the initiative to meet the challenge of difficulties, do not fear failure, from the setbacks to harvest growth nutrients. To carry forward the spirit of hard work, and actively engage in the practice of military strength, dare to ""find their own suffering"", more through the storm, see the world, in the struggle to sharpen the will and quality. On the other hand, to be persistent. Good image is not a day to establish, consistently adhere to high standards and strict requirements, there will be a good image. The majority of officers and soldiers should consciously cultivate a sense of standards and image consciousness, starting from small things, so that high standards and strict requirements become a habit. So you can set up a good image, forging yourself into a qualified revolutionary soldier who is trusted by the organization and recognized by his comrades.","The article emphasizes the importance of having high standards and strict requirements in order to establish a good image. Whether it is in the military or in everyday life, consistently striving for excellence and taking responsibility can greatly impact one's image. The article also mentioned a short video about the sentry at the northernmost post in China, who stood in the bitter cold and took off their gloves to salute, inspiring countless netizens. The image in action is crucial, as it can have a subtle, far-reaching, and lasting impact on one's own image.  
 
The article also mentioned the fact that a person who adheres to high standards and strict requirements, does things seriously and responsibly, is seen as a reliable person in the eyes of the leadership and colleagues. This reflects the fact that individuals whose actions are carried out with such standards can positively impact not only themselves but also the collective as a whole.  
 
Moreover, the article touched upon the importance of high standards and strict requirements in the military. The ""model of the times"" title of the naval party committee of the Nanchang ship is an example of how having high standards and strict requirements can create a good style, and establish and maintain a good image. The Party Committee of Nanchang has always taken ""first"" as its goal, making the pursuit of ""first-class warships, first-class standards and first-class career"" a conscious action of the officers and men, and has successfully accomplished major tasks many times, fully displaying the military style and spirit that can win battles.  
 
Ultimately, the article stresses the fact that high standards and strict requirements stem from the pursuit of lofty aspirations. Only when individuals have great ambitions in pursuit of their work will they combine their work with high standards and strict requirements to set up a good image, and progressively achieve their cause. In order to maintain such high standards and strict requirements, it is also emphasized that a sense of responsibility is crucial. Without it, individuals may not have the motivation to consistently achieve excellence. Finally, the article points out that high standards and strict requirements need to be followed in practice. It is not enough to merely internalize the concept, but it must be accompanied by a tenacious will, and it should be persistently maintained."

One part of the deployment, nine parts of the implementation. Do not focus on the implementation, do not seriously grasp the implementation, and then good planning and deployment is also a castle in the air. At present, all units are planning a new year's work, the development of new goals and tasks. To solidly promote the implementation of the task, the realization of the goal, party members and cadres, especially leaders and cadres at all levels must grasp the implementation of the key to fulfilling their duties and responsibilities to promote the development of a higher standard, a more realistic style of decision-making and deployment at the grass-roots level to take root and see the results. With strong party spirit to grasp the implementation without compromise. Can not grasp the implementation, not only reflects the work attitude, is also an important measure of the strength of the party cadres and cadres of the party. In reality, the implementation of some of the work is not satisfactory, not excluding the impact of some objective factors, but more or subjective understanding is not in place, not from a higher political standpoint to grasp the implementation of the problem. For leading cadres at all levels, to show more to show, to hang more to march. Only always mind ""the country's great"", good at observing and dealing with problems from the political point of view, in order to ensure that the implementation of the work is not out of shape, have strength, see results. To continuously improve political judgment, political comprehension, political implementation, consciously put the areas under their charge, the work engaged in the strategic overall planning, serious benchmarking, timely calibration of deviation, with strong party spirit to promote the higher level of clear objectives and tasks and the strategic deployment of the implementation of the results. To the vigorous state of thunder and lightning to grasp the implementation. The good bow in the hand, the expensive in the quick hair. Whether it is military training and preparation for war, or scientific research; whether it is usually teaching and training, or to complete the major drills and training tasks, once you look at the plan, we must come up with the posture of the day and night, not wait for me, early power, fast power, as soon as possible, the work of the plan into practical action, and scramble for time and seize the day, grasp the quick work. If you relax and slack off, hesitation and hesitation, you may miss the opportunity, miss the opportunity.

The first step is to make sure that you have a good understanding of the situation, and that you have a good understanding of the situation. Excellent style of pragmatic implementation. ""The difference between the virtual and the real, woe and blessing of the new also."" Pragmatism, is our party's consistent fine tradition and style, is the party's various undertakings continue to achieve new victories an important guarantee. Practice shows that, without understanding the actual troops, grasp the implementation will be empty, contrary to the objective law, it is difficult to guide the construction of good troops, promote combat effectiveness jump. The army is to fight, not a little false. Leading cadres at all levels should establish and practice a correct concept of performance, firmly grasp the ideological weapon of seeking truth from facts and the magic weapon of victory, and always take the investigation and research as the foundation of planning, the way to success, eyes down, feet down, often down to the front line, listen to the truth, the truth, and effectively find out the situation, to find the right problem, the countermeasures to mention the real. At the same time, adhere to the dry in the real, pragmatic, from the decomposition of tasks, clear responsibility, to schedule, stubble advancement, and then to check and guide, supervise the implementation, to seek truth from facts, pragmatic throughout all aspects of the work of the troops and the whole process, to grasp the iron and trace, leaving a mark on the stone of the excellent style of work implementation, step by step to achieve results, and solidly promote the construction of the troops ""!

Do not want to grasp the implementation, dare not grasp the implementation, will not grasp the implementation, the test is the ability of party members and cadres and the quality of play. Ability to harden, the implementation of the work can be more rules and regulations, more force, more effective. At present, we shoulder the mission task arduous and heavy, facing the complexity of the contradictions and difficulties. If you encounter difficulties and obstacles on the retreat, encounter the rapids on the detour, do not dare to meet the challenges, really tough, can not create a new situation of career development, but also difficult to train to take on the heavy responsibility of the hard spine, iron shoulders, real skills. Only open to go out, dare to do, determined to ""know that there is a tiger in the mountain, the tiger mountain,"" the determination to move a few more times ""stumbling blocks"", more fight a few times ""blocking the tiger"", more through a few ""Storm"", in order to break out of a new world of career development, in overcoming difficulties in the ability to realize the quality of the leap. Towards the goal, leading cadres at all levels should set an example, take the lead, and be the vanguard of the preparation for war, the main force of the transformation and development, the pioneer of the innovation of the method of warfare, in the attack on the difficulties in the refining of the courage, sharpening the will, in the thorns and thorns in the growth of competence, enhancement of skills, dare to break through the vitality of the work, and good work and good work in the promotion of the cause of strong military development.","The article emphasizes the importance of grasping the implementation methodology in the military.
