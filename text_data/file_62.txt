translated_title: MOFCOM Announcement No. 14 of 2023 Announcement on the Ruling on the End-of-Term Review of Anti-Dumping Measures Applied to Imported Vinylidene Chloride-Vinyl Chloride Copolymer Resins Originating in Japan
translated_content: On April 19, 2017, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued Announcement No. 17 of 2017, deciding to impose anti-dumping duties on imports of vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymerization resins originating from Japan from April 20, 2017, with an implementation period of five years. The duty rate for all Japanese companies is 47.1%. On April 19, 2022, upon the application of China's vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymerization resin industry, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") issued Announcement No. 11 of 2022, deciding to conduct an end-of-period review investigation, commencing on April 20, 2022, into the anti-dumping measures applied to imports of vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymerization resin originating from Japan. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) conducted an investigation into the possibility of the continuation or recurrence of dumping of imported vinylidene chloride copolymer resins originating from Japan and the possibility of the continuation or recurrence of damage to the vinylidene chloride copolymer resins industry in China if the anti-dumping measures are terminated, and in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Anti-Dumping (hereinafter referred to as the "Anti-Dumping Regulations") and made a decision on review (see Annex). The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has ruled that, if the anti-dumping measures are terminated, the dumping of imported vinylidene chloride (VCM) copolymerized resins originating from Japan on China may recur, and the damage caused to China's VCM copolymerized resins industry may recur. In accordance with Article 50 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), based on the results of the investigation, proposed to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council (CTC) to continue to implement the anti-dumping measures, and the CTC of the State Council, based on the MOFCOM's proposal, decided to continue to levy anti-dumping duties, and to continue to impose anti-dumping duties on the imported vinylidene chloride copolymer resin originating from Japan, starting from April 20, 2023 on the basis of the MOFCOM's proposal. The anti-dumping duty will continue to be imposed for a period of five years. The scope of products on which anti-dumping duties are imposed are those to which the original anti-dumping measures apply, consistent with the scope of products in the Ministry of Commerce's Announcement No. 17 of 2017. The details are as follows: Name of the investigated products: Vinylidene Chloride-Vinyl Chloride Copolymerized Resin, also known as VDC-VC Copolymerized Resin and Chloro Vinylidene Resin. English name: Vinylidene Chloride - Vinyl Chloride Copolymer Resin Chemical molecular formula: - [-CH2CCl2-]m-[-CH2CHCl-]n Physical and chemical properties: Vinylidene Chloride - Vinyl Chloride Copolymer Resin is a copolymerization resin made of Vinylidene Chloride, which is the largest monomer in terms of mass fraction, and the second monomer Vinyl Chloride. The vinylidene chloride copolymer is produced by copolymerization of vinylidene chloride, the largest monomer in mass fraction, and vinyl chloride, the second monomer, with or without the addition of stabilizers, lubricants and other additives. The product is usually in the form of granule or powder, insoluble in most organic solvents such as gasoline, alcohol, vinyl chloride, etc., soluble in special solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc., and saponification reaction with alkali, with good electrical insulation, good barrier to oxygen and water. Main application: Vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer resin can be used for the production of single-layer or multi-layer film such as enteric coating film, cling film, heat-shrinkable film, laminating film, as well as cling bags, laminating bags, blow-molded bottles and other products. This product is categorized under the Import and Export Tariff Code of the People's Republic of China: 39045000, and products other than vinylidene chloride (PVC) copolymer resins under this tariff code are not included in the scope of products under investigation. The rate of anti-dumping duty continued to be levied is the same as that stipulated in the Ministry of Commerce's Announcement No. 17 of 2017. The anti-dumping duty rates imposed on each company are as follows: 1. KUREHA CORPORATION 47.1% (KUREHA CORPORATION) 2. ASAHI KASEI CHEMICALS CORP. 47.1% (ASAHI KASEI CHEMICALS CORP.) 3. OTHER JAPANESE CORPORATIONS 47.1% C. Methods of Imposition of Anti-dumping Duty Effective from April 20, 2023, the import operator shall pay the corresponding anti-dumping duty to the Customs of the People's Republic of China when importing vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymerization resin originating in Japan. The anti-dumping duty shall be levied on an ad valorem basis on the duty-paid price finalized by the Customs, and the formula is: anti-dumping duty amount = customs duty-paid price × anti-dumping duty rate. Import VAT is levied ad valorem on the customs-validated duty-paid price plus customs duty and anti-dumping duty as the taxable price. Administrative Review and Administrative Litigation According to the provisions of Article 53 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Anti-Dumping, if you are not satisfied with the decision of this review, you may apply for administrative review or file a lawsuit to the People's Court in accordance with the law. V.
