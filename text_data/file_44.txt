On June 29, 2016, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") issued Announcement No. 25 of 2016, which adjusted the anti-dumping duty rates of Fujifilm Manufacturing (Europe) Ltd. and Fujifilm Manufacturing (USA) Ltd. On March 22, 2018, MOFCOM issued Announcement No. 29 of 2018, deciding to continue to impose anti-dumping duties on imported photographic paper originating from the EU, the U.S., and Japan from March 23, 2018, with an implementation period of five years. According to MOFCOM Announcement No. 3 of 2021, after the end of the transition period of the UK's exit from the European Union on December 31, 2020, the trade remedy measures that have been previously imposed on the EU will continue to be applicable to the EU and the UK, and the implementation period will remain unchanged; and the UK will no longer be treated as a member state of the EU in respect of the new trade remedy investigations and review cases initiated against the EU after that date. On January 3, 2023, MOFCOM received an application for end-of-period review of the anti-dumping measures filed by Lokai Film Co. on behalf of the Chinese photo paper industry. The applicant asserted that if the anti-dumping measures were terminated, the dumping of imported photographic paper originating from the EU, the United States and Japan on China might continue or recur, and the injury to the Chinese industry might continue or recur, and requested MOFCOM to conduct an end-of-period review investigation of imported photographic paper originating from the EU, the United States and Japan, and to maintain the anti-dumping measures imposed on the imports of photographic paper originating from the EU, the United States and Japan. The applicant did not file an application for final review of the anti-dumping measures applied to the imported photographic paper originating in the United Kingdom.
