Immature or transitional nuclear powers are likely to pose especially pressing \\nproblems for US strategy and military planning over the coming decades. In light of this \\nprobability, the United States should develop the capability both to confront and, at least in a \\nlimited sense, defeat such powers while also preventing or deterring them from employing \\nnuclear weapons for decisive effect. Such a balancing act will require a sophisticated set of \\ncapabilities and equally sophisticated planning, posturing, and action. This study will examine \\nseveral different possible responses, each with a correlative set of capability requirement s. The \\nfirst option is to maintain the status quo with its brittle binary responses to nuclear threats: \\ninaction or nuclear retaliation. The second option would invest in capabilities that allow the US \\nto defeat an adversary willing to use its nascent nuclear arsenal. The last option is an extensive \\nprogram intended to permit the US to conduct operations across the military spectrum in the face \\nof significant nuclear use by an opponent. \\nThe bottom line is quite simple: the United States should have military and technological options \\nto deal with emerging nuclear powers. However , investing in meaningful response options would \\nrequire the US political leadership to acknowledge that the current status quo strategy- with its \\nfocus on preparing for strictly conventional regional contingencies -is dangerously inadequate . \\nThis may be especially true in dealing with emerging nuclear states, such as the Islamic Republic \\nof Iran, that have a strongly revisionist geo-strategic agenda. On the other hand, if the United \\nStates decides against making the investment to adapt to these emerging nuclear powers, it calls \\ninto question the central rationale for continuing a massive and sustained investment in high \\ntechnology conventional capabilities since few will wish to fight the United States on its own \\nterms. In a world of nuclear-armed adversaries, forces optimized to fight only conventionally\\xad\\narmed regional powers would seem to have little utility. \\nTrends Toward Nuclear Proliferation : Nuclear weapons capability has slowly spread through a \\nprocess of punctuated equilibria. 1 The history of nuclear weapon proliferation has seen periods of \\nrapid emergence of several nuclear-armed states followed by periods of relative quiescence. (See \\nAppendix A for a greater explanation of this phenomenon) . Despite pessimistic expectations, \\nextensive proliferation did not occur during the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet \\nUnion prevented this outcome through the containment of regional contests within the larger \\nsuperpower rivalry and their provision of security guarantees to likely developers of nuclear \\nweapons. Regardless, several states elected to develop modest independent nuclear capabilities \\nfor reasons including prestige, independence, and deterrence. In the post-Cold War era, the \\nfundamental dynamics of nuclear proliferation changed: regional competitions lost their \\nrestraints, superpower patronage waned, and US conventional capability became \\noverwhelmingly dominant. \\n1 For a description of this phenomenon see Roger C. Molander and Peter A. Wilson,\" On Dealing with the Prospect \\nofNuclear Chaos,\\'\\' The Washington Quarterly, Summer 1994.

For these regional powers at odds with the United States and bereft of a \\nsuperpower protector-and unable to duplicate the scale of US conventional power-nuclear \\nweapons promised to enable them to deter hostile US action and/or regional rivals through \\nefficient, cost-effec tive, asymmetric means. Further, based on the past pattern of punctuated \\nequilibria, proliferation to these nations seems likely to spur other regional powers to obtain \\nnuclear weapons to deter, defend, and balance against them. \\nIn light of the stunning superiority of American non-nuclear arms, US preparedness to fight a \\nwar involving nuclear weapons has atrophied. Further, the starkest challenge to US military \\ndominance in the post-Cold War period appeared not from the high end of the technologica l \\nspectrum, but from insurgency and terrorism, leading to calls for an increase in manpower and \\nfunding for the Army and Marines instead of preparation for a nuclear, biological , or chemical \\n(NBC) battlefield . \\nTrends suggest, however, that the United States will be challenged by new nuclear-armed powers \\nseeking to defeat US conventional dominance by going \"over\" rather than (or in addition to) \\n\"under\" it. The retired Chief of the Indian General Staff put it neatly several years after the \\nPersian Gulf War of 1991: \"Never fight the United States without nuclear weapons.\"3 Nuclear \\n1 The recent National Intelligence Estimate (NlE) on the status of the Iranian nuclear weapons program asserts with \\n\"high confidence\" that Iran\\'s weapons program has been \"halted\" since 2003. The authors inside the Intelligence \\nCommunity (I C) believe that the Iranian leadersrup made a risk benefit calculation that the downsides , including the \\nrisk of economic and military sanctions by the United States and its allies, outweighed the benefits of an early \\nweapon capability through a clandestine crash effort. On the other hand, the NIE acknowledges that the large scale \\n\"civilian\" centrifuge enrichment program continues to mature, with the potential to produce sufficient fissile \\nmaterial for a nuclear weapon sometime between 2010 and 2015, a point emphasized by several distinguished \\ncommentators , including Henry Kissinger and Dennis Ross. Not surprisingly th1s IC \"bombshell\" has prompted a \\nvigorous debate inside and outside of the Bush Administration as to whether the Iranian leadership is prepared to \\nnegotiate a \"grand bargain\" to make permanent the weapons program freeze and to lock down, via the IAEA, the \\nongoing fissile material production programs. Even with an internationa lly negotiated success, however, the US may \\nhave to accept that Iran will acquire through a robust \"civilian\" nuclear program a virtual nuclear arsenal, or break\\xad\\nout option. After all, the Iranian missile modernization programs that include the development of long-range solid \\npropellant ballistic missiles continues to move apace. See National Intelligen ce Estimate, \"Iran: Nuclear Intentions \\nand Capabilites,\" Director of National Intelligence (DNI), November 2007. Also, see George Friedman, \"The NIE \\nReport: Solving a Geopolitical Problem with Iran,\" STRA TFOR, December 3, 2007. \\nAn ambigious news story has emerged in Northeast Asia, where the North Korea in 2007 agreed to shut down its \\nnuclear weapons program. Currently, intense negotiations are underway to ascertain whether the North Korean \\nregime will \"come clean\" and divulge the extent and location of its ongoing nuclear weapons program. As of the end \\nof2007, the DPRK has taken action to dismantle its small production reactor; on the other hand, it did not meet the \\ndeadline to reveal the full extent of its fissile material production programs and associated weapons program. It is \\nnoteworthy that in both the Iran and North Korean cases, financial, economic , and regional security incentives may \\nprove sufficient to freeze-if not reverse-these programs. Libya\\'s decision to abandon its nuclear program in \\nreturn for diplomatic recognition and the opporrunity to engage in global trade in energy can be seen as a model of a \\nstate ending its active nuclear weapons program. \\n3 Cited in, Robert Manning , \"The Nuclear Age: The Next Chapter,\" Foreign Policy, Winter 1997-1998.

As the \\n\"absolute\" weapon, their destructiveness provides an unmatched deterrent and/or terror \\ncapability. Such weapons, especially second generation weapons in moderate to large numbers \\nwith reasonably r eliable delivery systems, offer effective deterrent capabilities. A North Korea or \\nIran stocked with survivable long-range ballistic and cruise missiles armed with nuclear \\nwarheads would likely be much less vulnerable to an American -led invasion or regime change. \\nFurthermore, such weapons are relatively cheap, especially compared to the cost of achieving the \\nsame strategic objective of greater regional influence with highly trained, high technology \\nconventional forces. \\nAmerican Vulnerability: A significant disjuncture exists, therefore, between the increasing \\nlikelihood that US adversaries may possess nuclear weapons and American lack of preparedness \\nto fight them. Many in US security policy circles dismiss the problem of fighting against a \\nnuclear-armed opponent as overblown, though some accept the implications of proliferation and \\nseem willing to accept a scaling back of American commitments abroad from their post-Cold \\nWar zenith. Others, however, argue that the US could continue its policies of assertive regional \\nintervention and influence even in the face of proliferation . This group believes that a mixture of \\nthe taboo against nuclear weapons and the fear of US retaliation will prevent adversaries from \\ncrossing the nuclear threshold . The immediate demands of the large protracted counter\\xad\\ninsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan contribute to the lack of focus on this problem, as does the \\nneed to prepare to fight conventional conflicts on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere. Further, \\nthe inertial tendencies of the Pentagon planning process favor a continuation of the present \\nprogram mix with its focus on high-technology conventional weapons.4 \\nThe situation, therefore, appears ripe for a strategic surprise in which a US opponent would \\nemploy nuclear weapons to stymie US and/or allied action. Several potential adversaries appear \\nresolved to acquire a nuclear capability in order to deny, deter, or in key respects defeat the \\nUnited States in a strategic conflict. \\nAt the operational level, however, the US military appears unprepared to fight against a regional \\nnuclear power. Furthermore, despite the fact that the planned US response to nuclear use by an \\nopponent involves nuclear retaliation, there is strong evidence, uncovered in many RAND table \\ntop exercises during the early 1990s, of viscerally strong antipathy among policymaker s against \\nusing nuclear weapons.5 Given the military\\'s apparent incapacity to fight a war against a nuclear \\ncreated a nuclear command and control system that is dominated by the military leadership with the civilian political \\nleadership in a clearly subordinate role. \\n4 See Defense Science Board (DSB), Nuclear Weapons Effects Test, Evaluation, and Simulation (Washington , DC: \\nUndersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, April 2005), for an extensive discussion of \\nthe fading significance of nuclear effects resilience (hardening) in the joint requirements process for current and next \\ngeneration weapons and C4ISR systems. \\ns See Marc Dean Millot, Roger Molander and Peter A.

Hence, the size and capability of the US nuclear \\narsenal looms over any strategic interaction involving the United States or its allies. The nature \\nof the arsenal, especially its employab ility and suitability for limited operations, will therefore \\naffect the United States' ability to conduct operations against nuclear-armed regional powers. \\nUnlike during the Cold War, the size and configuration of the US nuclear arsenal may now be \\nlargely decoupled from the evolution of the two other major nuclear-armed nations, the Russian \\nFederation and the People's Republic of China. Currently the United States and the Russian \\nFederation are committed to reducing their operational strategic nuclear arsenals down to \\napproximately 2000 weapons by 2012 via the Moscow Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty \\n(SORT). Furthermore, the ratified Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty {SALT-I) treaty with its \\nextensive verification provisions expires in 2009.

Wargaming evidence suggests an extreme aversion among US policymakers to \\nthe use of nuclear weapons and a strong desire to find non-nuclear responses.16 \\nThere is an element of bluff to the status quo posture and a future adversary may call that bluff. \\nGiven the increasing strength of the nuclear \"taboo\" among US Government and policy circles, \\ncombined with the notion of actual use seeming almost archaic after sixty years, such a call \\nmight leave the United States without realistic options. \\nOption A does provide, however, a mobilization base for the two more robust counter-nuclear \\noptions under consideration in this study. Specifically, substantial investments have been made \\nto build robust counterforce and active defense capabilities. These are consistent with the current \\nstrategy of ensuring that the United States has overwhelming air supremacy to conduct joint \\ncombined arms warfare against regional adversaries conducting conventional military operations. \\nThe US has also devloped enhanced small scale (battalion-brigade echelon) joint forcible entry \\nand expeditionary ground operations.

Neverthe less, under Option B the major fixed infrastructure targets of US regional \\nallies and even of the United States itself, specifically cities, will still be vulnerable to nuclear \\nattack. For this reason, deterrence likely will still play a vital role in controlling the level of \\nconflict. \\n17 US defense planning has made a strong de facto distinction between preparing for a nuclear battlefield and a \\nbattlefield \"dirtied\" with biological and chemical weapons. During the 1990s, the US made major investments in \\npassive defense techniques to neutralize the military effects of the use of biologica l and chemical weapons. This \\ninvestment was prompted in large measure by concerns about the prospect that North Korea had and would likely \\nuse chemical and biological weapons in a massive way during a second Korean War.

A central assumption of this option is \\ntherefore that a sustained investment in counterfo rce capabilities as well as active and passive \\ndefenses will allow the United States to neutralize the nuclear capabilities of Tier One and Tier \\nTwo powers. \\nLike Option B, Option C acknowledges that a limited number of nuclear weapons may \\nsuccessfully get through and therefore that US expeditionary forces in-theater must operate in a \\ndispersed/protected/flexible /mobile fashion from both stand-off distances and during deep \\noffensive operations designed to defeat a nuclear armed regime.

Given the enormous \\npotency of nuclear weapons this will, at the very least, require a marked change in the US \\nmilitary\\'s approach to force planning, programming, and structure. The joint force will need to \\ninvest heavily in developing highly effective counterfo rce and active defense capabilities in order \\nto deny opponents the ability to conduct successful nuclear strikes. \\nAssuming that \"some will get through,\" US and allied forces will have to become more flexible, \\ndispersed, mobile, and resilient, while employing other passive defense measures.

THEMES FROM THE HISTORY OF NUCLEAR \\nPROLIFERATION \\nNuclear weapons capability has spread through a process of punctuated equilibria. Despite \\npessimistic expectations , extensive proliferation did not occur during the Cold War. The United \\nStates and Soviet Union retarded proliferati on by containing regional contests within the larger \\nsuperpower rivalry and by providing security guarantees to likely developers of nuclear \\nweapons. Regardless, several states elected to develop modest independent nuclear capabilities \\nfor reasons including prestige, independence, and deterrence. In the post~Cold War era, the \\nfundamental dynamics changed: regional competitions became more fragmented, superpower \\npatronage waned, and US conventional capability became overwhelmingly dominant. In this \\nenvironment, nuclear weapons became a more attractive proposition, particularly for \"rogue \\nstates\" such as Iran and North Korea -regional powers at odds with the United States and \\nlacking a superpower protector. For these nations, nuclear weapons promised to enable them to \\ndeter hostile action by the United States or regional rivals through efficient and asymmetric \\nmeans. Further, based on the past pattern of punctuated equilibria, proliferation by these nations \\nseems likely to spur their neighbors to obtain nuclear weapons to deter, defend against, and/or \\nbalance them. \\nThe Importance of the Nuclear Umbrella-Exte nding the Benefits of Nuclear Possession Without \\nthe Means: The single most important, though by no means sole, determinan t in the history of \\nproliferation bas been the US and, to a lesser extent, Soviet security \"umbrellas\" or extended \\ndeterrent commitments.20 These \"umbrellas\" retarded proliferat ion by extending the benefits of a \\nnuclear capability to allied nations without disseminating the means. Thus the technology of \\nnuclear arms proliferated as a strategic reality, but control remained in only a few hands. \\nNaturally , the major issue for allied countries was whether the actual possessors of the weapons \\nwere reliable trustees, which explains the fervency of the NATO debates about the credibility of \\nthe American extended deterrent commitment in Europe. In the wake of the fall of the Soviet \\nUnion, however, a large number of states operate in an \"unincorporated\" nuclear environment, in \\nwhich they are vulnerable to the US and other states across the conventional and nuclear \\nspectrums. \\nProliferation\\'s Political Context-the Anxiously \"Unincorporated\" as First Movers: States that \\nhave elected to develop nuclear weapons are largely those that perceived themselves to be \\nsufficiently threatened by, isolated from, or suspicious of the \"manager/trustees\" of the global \\nsecurity system to require the advantages that nuclear weapons are seen to confer?1 States that \\n20 For the history of why some US allies were dissuaded from obtaining nuclear weapons, including Japan, \\nGennany, Taiwan, and South Korea, see Kurt M.

THE STRATEGIC CHALLENGE OF EMERGING \\nNUCLEAR POWERS \\nIn light of the declining threat of nuclear warfare, the IT-intensive RMA, and the protracted \\ncounterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, US military strategy and posturing has \\nfocused increasingly on conventional operations and low-intensity conflict. Grappling with a \\nnuclear-armed enemy has taken a backseat to the extent that by the late 2000s the US military \\nhas become largely unprepared for military operations against a nuclear-armed opponent.26 Yet, \\nfor a variety of reasons, adversaries of the United States and its allies will be strongly drawn \\ntoward asymmetric capabilities including nuclear weapons .Z7 If the United States is to preserve \\nthe capability to act on behalf of its own interests and those of its allies in non-total war contexts, \\nthe US military will have to meet this cballenge.28 \\nFrom the central focus of military thinking in the 1950s, nuclear weapons became increasing ly \\nmarginalized in real-world terms beginning in the 1960s with Flexible Response. This trend \\ncontinued in the 1970s with the IT-intensive RMA, maturing in the 1980s under Reagan and \\nGorbachev , and coming to fruition in the post-Cold War era of US military dominance and \\nRussian impotence . Purely conventional warfare, which had seemed dead to the strategists of the \\n1950s and fatal to early NATO planners, began to revive as American nuclear superiority \\ndecayed into parity, leaving a significant nuclear exchange appearing to many merely a recipe \\nfor mutual suicide. Western strategists began emphasizing the illogic of nuclear usage starting \\nwith the Flexible Response policy of the Kennedy-Johnson Administrations, which sought to \\ngive the Alliance the option to use limited means in defense of its interests. \\nThe IT -intensive RMA strengthened th.is trend in the late 1970s as guided munitions, all weather \\nsensors, and network-centric operations allowed NATO to defend Western Europe through \\nconventional means alone for the first time.

North Korea\\'s bomb is already fracturing the American\\xad\\nled security community in Northeast Asia. Nuclear weapons could cow some nations into \\nswearing off alliance with the US or, conversely, could force them closer into our embrace, \\npotentially exacerbating tensions with fourth-party countries.

Nuclear weapons also offer \\nconsiderable bargaining leverage, evidenced by the preferential treatment accorded new entrants \\nto the nuclear club. The intense emphasis put by the United States on preventing nuclear \\nacquisition by \"rogue\" states -contrasted with the generous nuclear deal struck with former bad \\nactor India -is indicative of the value of gaining the prize. \\nThe impact on the military sphere is also considerable. Nuclear weapons offer the distinct \\npossibility of negating the American advantage in conventional arms.

Though the United States managed to avoid any of \\nthese events during its standoff with the USSR, their fortuitous absence does not demonstrate \\ntheir impossibility or even necessarily their implausibility.36 Furthermore, the mere possession of \\nnuclear weapons might have indirect dampening effects on US actions, enabling an opponent to \\nuse nuclear weapons as a shield and other forces as a sword.37 Potential adversaries might, as the \\nUnited States did on several occasions during the Cold War, consider the use of nuclear weapons \\nin some limited fashion to be rational and cost-beneficial.38 \\n34 The counter invasion role of nuclear weapons should not be underestimated.

ALTERNATIVE NATIONAL SECURITY \\nRESPONSES \\nThe following sections consider three alternative national security re sponses to the challenge of \\nemerging nuclear-armed states. The first, or Option A, is the current posture which calls for only \\na minimal adaptation to this challenge and relies heavily on deterrence to neutralize the emerging \\nnuclear arsenal. The second, or Option B, is a moderate adaptation strategy that places a very \\nhigh reliance on current and next generation counter-force and active/passive defenses to deter, \\nand if necessary, neutralize immature regional nuclear threats. The third response, or Option C, is \\nan aggressive adaptation strategy that calls for a full spectrum of offensive and defensive \\ncapabilities to neutralize a regional nuclear power. The following is the strategic rationale for the \\nthree options in terms of how the Joint Operational Concepts (JOC) for Major Contingency \\nOperations and Deterrence might be modified to meet this emerging challenge. \\nOPTION A \\nDoctrine and Concepts of Operation \\nThe central assumption of Option A, the status quo, is that the Joint Operations Concept for \\nMCOs and Deterrence42 does not need not major revision in light of nuclear proliferation: \\n• Planning for Nuclear Opponents: The number of emerging nuclear powers can be \\ncontained through a vigorous combination of nonproliferation policy and action. \\nShould such efforts fail, the US can deter emergent nuclear armed states from using \\ntheir arsenal in a militarily significant way through the threat of regime and/or \\nsocietal destroying non-nuclear and, if necessary, nuclear retaliation. \\n• Continuing Need for Strategic Deterrence: Defenses will not play a major part in \\ndealing with nuclear-armed regional adversaries. High value civilian targets of \\nregional allies may not be fully protected from nuclear attack, and their protection \\nmay continue to rely upon the threat of large scale retaliation including the use of \\nnuclear weapons. \\n• Cu\"ent Counterforce and Defensive Capabilities Suffzcient: The current investment \\nin a combined offensive and defensive counter-nuclear capability should, through \\ndeterrence and/or actual operation, be able to protect large scale expeditionary \\noperations . Because of the reliance on deterrence and the emphasis on exclusion of \\nnuclear weapons from conflicts, the United States may be better served under this \\noption in not pursuing strong counterforce capabilities in order to avoid \"use or lose\" \\nor \"launch on warning\" situations. \\n42 See Joint Publication 3-12, Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations, Final Coordination (2), March 15, 2005, with \\nits focus on the deterrence vice warfighting role of the US nuclear arsenal. \\n7 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The central \\noperational assumption of this option is that with proper and sustained investment in \\ncounterforce capabilities as well as in active and passive defenses, the United States can conduct \\na counter-nuclear campaign to neutralize a regional opponent armed with an \"immature\" or Tier \\nOne arsenal stocked with first generation fission weapons. Option B takes a \"middle road\" \\nbetween the current strategy, Option A, which effective ly ignores opponent nuclear capabilities, \\nand a true attempt at full-fledged warfighting in a nuclear environment. Option B seeks to give \\ngreater plausibility to US nuclear warfighting than available under Option A -both for deterrent \\nand warfighting purposes -while acknowledging that there are limits to nuclear use beyond \\nwhich military operations are effectively impossible. It might be conceived of as a modem \\nvariant of Flexible Response, simultaneously providing more tailored options to the US in the \\nevent of a nuclear strike (as opposed to the immediate resort to nuclear retaliation) and a more \\ncredible deterrent against such use by opponents. \\nOption B therefore seeks to structure US forces to be credibly able to conduct successful \\noperations in the face of limited nuclear use without recourse to massive, \"strategic\" nuclear \\nresponse, an option RAND research suggests is unlikely to be exercised by American \\npolicymakers.43 Facing an enemy armed with a limited number of nuclear weapons that may \\nsuccessfully penetrate US defenses, the strategy posits that expeditionary forces in-theater must \\noperate effectively and decisively in a dispersed, protected , flexible, and mobile fashion from \\nstand-off distances in order to minimize their attractiveness as targets and limit damage in the \\nevent of a successfu l enemy strike. Nevertheless, under Option B the major fixed infrastructure \\ntargets of US regional allies and even of the United States itself, specifically cities, will still be \\nvulnerable to nuclear attack. For this reason, deterrence will still play a vital role in controlling \\nthe level of conflict. \\nReflecting this strategic approach, the current JOC for MCOs will have to be revised in the \\nfollowing fashion: \\n• Planning for Nuclear Opponents: Acknowledge that future MCOs may involve \\nopponents armed with and willing to use nuclear weapons. \\n43 See RAND\\'s \"The Day After ... \"exercise results. \\n8 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Preparing for Nuclear Operations: Cold \\nWar Lessons Learned \\nThe attempts of both the United States and the Soviet Union to field forces capable of waging \\nwar on a nuclear battlefield yield several lessons that should be borne in mind when thinking \\nthrough the problem of how to conduct military operations against nuclear-armed regional \\nadversaries . While these lessons do not provide clear guidance for how to move forwar~ they do \\nsuggest the enduring realities, limitations, and possibilities of nuclear warfighting . (See \\nAppendix B for a more complete discussion.) \\nThere are severe and intractable difficulties in developing forces for nuclear warfare. The \\nUnited States eventually came to the conclusion that, beyond a certain point, military operations \\nin a nuclear war would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to conduct. The Soviets appear \\nto have eventually reached a similar conclusion. The demands of survivability and effectiveness \\nare conflicting and, on a nuclear battlefield , enormously intensified The Pentomic Division is a \\nparadigmatic example of these difficulties, and its failure came despite intense institutional \\ninterest in developing ways to conduct military operations in a nuclear war.44 The vulnerability \\nof US Navy carrier battle groups to saturation nuclear strikes during the Cold War is another \\nsuch representative example.45 \\nConducting operations against an adversary with a large sophistica ted arsenal is different than \\nfacing one with a small immature arsenal. A large scale nuclear war with a Soviet Union-type \\nnuclear power would likely render military operations effectively impossible. A nuclear conflict \\nwith a country with a more limited arsenal, such as North Korea or an early Soviet Union or \\nChina, likely would allow significant space for military operations . Assessments that traditional \\nwarfighting would be possible in the 1940s and 1950s held greater plausibility than \\nsubsequently, when arsenals became much larger and more sophisticated. \\nIn a conflict involving nuclear powers, the lines between conventional and nuclear and between \\ntactical and strategic would not be clear. The \"fog of war,\" incentive structures, differing \\ninterpretations of strategic categories, and other dynamics would all contribute to a great deal of \\nvagueness and unpredictability regarding the use of nuclear weapons in a conflict. In an outright \\n44 Fundamenta lly, the Pentomic Division concept was unworkable . It assumed that an infantry-type division could \\nrely on a limited number of armored persoMel carriers held at the division level to provide protected mobility for \\nthe maneuver battalions. The limitations of this design became evident during various field exercises that led to the \\nemergence of the fully mechanized infantry divisions optimized for combat in Europe during the early 1960s.

A fundamenta l impact of the silicon-based technological \\nrevolution is the tremendous improvement in the effectiveness, reliability , and flexibility of \\nconventional weapons and systems. Indeed, much of the appeal of the guided \\nmunitions /network-centric RMA lies in its promise to replace missions traditionally accorded to \\nnuclear weapons with guided munitions and the like. This RMA enables lighter, less logistic\\xad\\nintensive, and more mobile conventional forces; precisely the attributes the planners of the 1950s \\nidentified as critical to operating in nuclear combat. That said, however, nuclear weapons in \\nsufficient numbers are likely a \"trump card\" against advanced conventiona l capabilities, since \\nthey have orders of magnitude greater destructive power that can compensate for the \\nsophistication of RMA systems. If available in large numbers, nuclear weapons can be used as \\nbrute force to defeat a technologically more sophisticated opponent. Furthermore, dominance in \\nguided weapons/network-centric conventional warfare actually encourages future opponents to \\nconsider employing nuclear weapons to even the playing field. Finally, these high technology \\nnon-nuclear capabilities may be over-hyped, especially against targets that require ultra-reliable \\ntarget location. The poor US performance against Iraqi SCUDs and mobile Serbian air defense \\nsystem are two examples of the weaknesses exhibited by even the most modem conventional \\nsystems.47 \\nAlliance dynamics significantly complicate preparing for and conducting nuclear operations. \\nDuring the Cold War, US allies regularly and vehemently argued for markedly different \\napproaches to nuclear operations. In Europe, especially after the 1950s, NATO allies, fearing the \\neffects of nuclear combat on their territories, consistently pushed against the Alliance\\'s focus on \\nwaging such a war. The effects ofNATO\\'s operation Carte Blanche in 1962, for instance, went a \\ngreat distance towards convincing the West German government that nuclear war on its territory \\nwould be catastrophic, whoever ultimately prevailed. The emergence of large peace and anti\\xad\\nnuclear movements from the end of the 1960s also put immense political pressure on West \\nEuropean governments to shy away from nuclear warplanning. \\nAdding to the planning complexity within the NATO was the emergence of the UK and French \\nindependent nuclear forces.

The major challenges raised by the emergence of the French nuclear force inside the \\nAtlantic Alliance suggest future challenges for the United States if major allies in the Greater \\nMiddle East or Northeast Asia conclude that they need an independent nuclear capability as well. \\nIn Asia, anti-nuclear movements arose in South Korea in the 1980s and 1990s and pushed \\nagainst the conduct of nuclear operations in a war on the Korean Peninsula .

RESPONDING TO A REGIONAL NUCLEAR \\nCHALLENGE: THE STATUS Quo, OPTION A \\nWhile the current US approach to dealing with nuclear-armed opponents has not yet resulted in \\nany strategic defeat or embarrassment, such eventualities are increasingly likely as more powers \\nobtain nuclear weapons and see opportunities to take advantage of binary American \"all or \\nnothing\" commitments. Despite the brittleness of the status quo strategy, current and planned \\nprograms provide some of the counterforce and defensive capabilities required to confront a \\nnuclear-armed adversary. In themselves, these capabilities are insufficient to confront a \\ndetermined nuclear foe, however they do provide a foundation for the development of options A \\nand B. The following section will discuss the status quo with an eye for how the US could \\ndevelop these capabilities for more robust nuclear warfighting. There are major technological, \\noperational , and organizational challenges to effect such a result.51 \\nEnhanced Counterforce Investments \\nDeveloping a credible counterforce capability will require dramatic improvements. Historically, \\nnon-nuclear counterforce campaigns against mobile, hidden, and/or hardened targets have been \\nunsuccessful. Noteworthy was the almost total failure of the \"SCUD bunt\" campaign during the \\nfirst Persian Gulf War in 1991. Even with the extensive deployment of Special Forces units in \\nthe suspected Iraqi SRBM operating areas of western Iraq and the employment of more than \\n3500 tactical air sorties, the campaign recorded failed to knock out a significant number of Iraqi \\nSCUDs-and may not have knocked out any.52 To defeat a regional opponent armed with a \\nnuclear arsenal, even of modest size, the performance of any counterforce campaign will have to \\nimprove radically if Option B is to be attractive for policymakers . The basic requirements for a \\nsuccessfu l counterforce capability are near-real time surveillance , tracking, and target \\nacquisition; platforms that can respond very quickly to acquisition , acquire the target, and launch \\nthe appropriate weapons package against it; weaponry that can defeat, destroy, or disable enemy \\nnuclear capabilities that are hidden, mobile, and/or hardened; and capabilities that can correctly \\nassess whether a strike has been successful and take required follow-on actions.53 \\nMany of the components of this improvement in capability already largely exist, as the US has \\nmade major progress since the first Persian GulfWar of 1991 through a massive investment in \\ncapabilities relevant to any future counter-nuclear campaign. The most important improvements \\ninclude the following: \\n51 See Barry R.

In the face of moderate to high air defense threats, these vehicles cannot operate over \\npotential targets of interest and instead must operate in a stand-off mode. In the later case, the \\neffectiveness of the aerial surveillance platforms decreases due to terrain masking of potential \\ntargets and the lower resolution of their radar and electro-optical sensors operating at longer \\ndistances. 59 \\nThe combined effect of these broad advances in reconnaissance-strike capability is that the \\nUnited States can readily attack and destroy all known targets on the surface of the earth, land or \\nsea. With its undisputed air supremacy following a Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) \\ncampaign, the US military can readily defeat conventionally equipped and organized armed \\nforces under all weather conditions.60 What these major advances in combat capabilities have not \\nprovided is military dominance against insurgent forces or nation states armed with hidden, \\nmobile, or buried long-range ballistic and cruise missiles. \\nEnhanced Active Defense Investments \\nHighly effective active defenses will play a critical part in any successful variant of Option B. \\nThe United States will need to reduce its current vulnerability to ballistic and cruise missile \\nattack if US forces are to be able to operate effectively in an NBC environment.61 \\nThe US military has made some significant strides forward in active defenses. After a very large \\nand sustained investment in ballistic missile defense (BMD), the United States is now deploying \\noperational systems with capabilities superior to the marginal capability of the Patriot-2 (PAC-2) \\nsurface-to-air missile system. These are the Patriot-3 (P AC-3), with a hit to kill interceptor, and \\nthe Navy\\'s Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) with a hit to kill interceptor.

Similar to the SM-3, this is an exo-atrnospheric hit to kill system.

Currently the \\nvital PNT mission is proved by the NA VSTAR GPS space constellation that operations at \\nMedium Earth Orbit (MEO). Most earth observation, (i.e., space reconnaissance) satellites \\noperate at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Others such as some metrological and early warning satellites \\noperate at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO). Most communications satellites operate at GEO \\nbut there is a family of satellites that provide mobile communi cations at LE0.67 \\nThis space services infrastructure is sustained by a NSS launch capability. Presently, this is \\nprovided by the United Launch Alliance (ULA) that operates two families of the Evolved \\nExpendable Launch Vehicle (EEL V), the Delta IV and Atlas V. This launch infrastructure \\noperates on a \"launch on schedule\" concept of operations that allows for the steady \\nmodernization and replenishment of the three NSS space services described above.68 \\nThis architecture is very vulnerable to attack, especially those systems operating in LEO. The \\nrecent Chinese non-nuclear hit to kill anti-satellite (ASAT) test has highlighted this threat to \\nsatellites operating at LEO. The architecture will become even more vulnerable if a regional \\npower uses nuclear weapons as either an ASA T or to generate an adverse operational \\nenvironment. \\nAt present, these emerging threats have prompted a debate within the space services and launch \\ncommunities as to whether a new NSS architecture is needed. Currently, the Air Force is \\nexploring the concept of Operationally Responsive Space (ORS). Two different approaches have \\nbeen considered. The first is to develop a new generation of much smaller and less costly \\nsatellites that will be \"launched on demand\" by a new family of responsive and low cost space \\nlaunch vehicles. The second is to consider the developm ent of a new generation of space \\nreconnaissance satellites that will operate in much larger constellations than the small number of \\nvery heavy and costly reconnaissance systems in use today. The first concept is focused on \\nproviding the national and theater users with a capacity to reconstitute some of the capability \\ndegraded or destroyed during a regional conflict. The second focuses less on reconstitution \\n66 See Martin Streetly, \"US Navy Rolls Out First E-20 Advanced Hawkeye ,\" International Defense Review, June I, \\n2007; and Martin Streetly, \"Advanced Hawkeye Promises Quantumn Leap in US Navy\\'s AEW capability,\" \\nInternational Defense Review, August I, 2006, for description of Navy AEW upgrades.

For example, the EMP effects for a 10-20 \\nkiloton ground burst may only extend a few miles from the site of the detonation. A ground or \\nlow-altitude burst can also destroy computers within the range of the blast and thermal effects. It \\nis also likely to affect communications networks, but the range of the disruption is very limited. \\nAs described in Appendix C, the high-altitude EMP (HEMP) effects are less well understood, but \\ncould be substantial depending on height of burst and weapon yield. In considering HEMP \\neffects, it must be kept in mind that assessments in this realm of nuclear weapons effects are \\nderivative of a very limited number of high-altitude tests and that there is considerable debate \\nand uncertainty about the magnitude of such effects on contemporary electronic systems. 70 \\nThe emerging long-range strike, active defense and C4ISR capabilities described above are being \\ndeveloped with only modest emphasis given to the prospect that they will have to operate in a \\nnuclear battlespace .71 They may have to operate in an environment where one or more nuclear \\nweapons have been detonated to generate wide area electromagnetic effects or detonated in space \\nto \"pump\" the van Allen belt, which could degrade all LEO satellites.72 \\n69 For an evaluation of the ORS concept see McCartney, National Security Space Launch Report, pp. 39-43. Pedro \\nRustan of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is one of the foremost proponents of a new generation of \\nsmaller and more numerous LEO reconnaissance satellites. Battlefield commanders will be provided with much \\nmore frequent coverage than with a large constellation of LEO surveillance satellites. This is the concept of the \\nSpace Based Radar (SBR) constellation. At present, the later program has been all but killed by Congress over \\ntechnology risks, costs, and operational issues. \\n70 The RAND Corporation did an assessment of the EMP threat in conjunction with the 2004 Congressionally \\nmandated Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Auack. It found \\nthat for low-yield first generation fission weapons, the HEMP effect would be more distruptive in nature, for \\ninstance to system control and data (SCAD A) system of the civilian power grid. Modem commerical electronics for \\nautomobiles could also be vulnerable because of their dense and low power solid state design, but they are likely to \\nbe resiJient to low-yield HEMP effects because of their protected configuration against the electromagnetic \\ninterference (EMI) found in their normal operating environment. Other experts testifying before the commission and \\nCongress expressed considerable alarm about the vulnerability of the US civilian IT infrastructure. Some have noted \\nthat while weapons systems and the narrow-band communications systems associated with Cold War era strategic \\nnuclear forces are relatively well protected , US tactical weapon systems have emerged as vuJnerable to nuclear \\ngenerated electromagnetic effects. \\n71 An important exception to this rule has been the continued investment in next generation EHF communication \\nsatellites, the Advanced EHF (AEHF), as a higher bandwidth follow-on to the MILSTAR constellation, which was \\ndesigned to function in a nuclear disturbed environment. EHF provides a means to communicate through the \\nionosphere even if it is energized by high altitude nuclear detonations (scintillation). \\n12 For more on the EMP issue, see Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from \\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, (Washington, DC: Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from \\nElectromagnetic Pulse Attack, 2004).

From this assumption, there has been a rather consistent policy \\nthat the current and next generation weapons and C4ISR systems should not pay a significant \\n\"EMP tax\" to provide for protection against this phenomenon .73 \\nEnhanced R&D and Training \\nThe US national security leadership has acknowledged the challenge of a counter-nuclear \\ncampaign since the first Persian Gulf War. Throughout the 1990s, the Defense Threat Reduction \\nAgency (DTRA) became the lead agency to develop improved counter-force capabilities. The \\nfinancial support for a variety of Advanced Concept and Technology Demonstrators was \\nparticularly noteworthy. These included the demonstration of a hard target smart fuse, an \\nadvanced earth penetrating warhead (EPW), and improved targeting concepts against mobile and \\nhidden targets.7 Further, DTRA has developed planning tools for the conduct of counter-nuclear \\ncampaigns including the Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA), the Munitions \\nEffects Assessment (MEA), and the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC).75 \\nWith the reorganization of the combatant commands during the turn of the century, US Strategic \\nCommand (USSTRA TCOM) took on the counter-nuclear mission as part of the broader counter\\xad\\nWMD campaign. To that end, the command developed jointly with DTRA the \\nCounterproliferation Analysis Planning System (CAPS), a computer-based program at Lawrence \\nLivennore National Laboratory where intelligence is collected, analyzed, and displayed on the \\nWMD programs of states of concern. CAPS has become a key enabler of USSTRATCOM\\'s \\ncapability to support regional combatant commanders in the event they require the development \\nand execution of a regional counter-nuclear campaign.76 \\nDepartments of Defense and Energy, 1977, 3rd Edition), Chapter X, \"Radio and Radar Effects,\" for a summary of \\nthe diverse nuclear effects on key elements of the IT -intensive elements of contemporary warfare. \\n73 For discussion of this phenomenon see DSB, Nuclear Weapons Effects Test, Evaluation, and Simulation.

By 2003, these annual exercises ceased due to the personnel and \\nfinancial resources being directed toward the demands of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) \\nand Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Further, high level national security focus shifted to the \\nchallenge of defeating the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). This led to the multi\\xad\\nbillion dollar Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (llEDDO). Even the \\nsyllabus of the Army\\'s National Training Centers (NTCs) shifted away from conventional \\ncombined arms training, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) that of dealing with the complex \\nchallenge of counterinsurgency and stabilization operations. 77 \\nEnhanced Expeditionary Capability \\nThe Future Combat Systems (FCS)-The Army\\'s premier modernizatio n plan includes there\\xad\\nequipment of roughly one third of the active Army (fifteen Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs)) with \\na new generation of C4, a wide range of air and ground unmanned vehicles, and a new family of \\narmored fighting vehicles. At the beginning of this program, the Army hoped that the weight of \\nthe family of combat vehicles could be less than 20 tons. This would facilitate the use of selected \\nFCS-equipped BCTs as mounted vertical maneuver (MVM) or \"air mechanized\" units. The \\nBCTs would maneuver through the air via very large vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) assault \\ncargo aircraft to support distant (up to five hundred miles) air assault operations. Proponen ts of \\nthis concept believe that the MVM concept will provide the joint force with a unique operational \\nmaneuver capability to rapidly collapse the cohesion of a regional power under attack by US \\nforces. Since its inception in 1999, the FCS program has undergone some important changes. Of \\ngreatest significance is the fact that the weight of the proposed family of vehicles has risen to \\napproximately 30 tons to accommodate new requirements for survivability in the face of a wide \\nrange of direct, indirect and mine (lED) threats. Proponents of MVM contend that the heavier \\ncombat vehicles should be lifted by a new generation heavy lift VTOL aircraft, the Joint Heavy \\nLift (JHL) program.78 \\nIndependent of whether the MVM concept emerges with a fleet of JHL, the FCS armored vehicle \\nprogram should result in a new generation of \"medium-weight \" armored vehicles with improved \\nfuel economy.

Over the last \\nthree decades, a major global industry has emerged in the development and deployment \\nof tunneling systems. There has been no global restraint in the sale of this technology to \\nany willing buyer. Unlike the previous challenges, super hardening places high \\ntechnological demands on the development of deep to very deep earth penetrating \\nwarheads. Further, tunneling technology allows for the construction of deep and \\ndispersed underground facilities that will require precise target identification even if an \\neffective EPW is available.89 \\n86 China has made major advances in long-range cruise missile technology that could be exported to a variety of \\nregional powers.

The Northrop \\nGrumman X-47 program is scheduled for such testing by the beginning of the next decade. If the \\ntests are successfu l then the Navy has the option of making a major investment in the N-UCAS \\nas a long-range reconnaissance-strike platform.

With a combat radius of \\n1500 nm, the N-UCAS provides a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) with the capability to conduct \\ndeep reconnaissance strike operations. The vehicle's LO features will allow it to conduct \\nsustained operations in the face of sophisticated air defenses.91 \\nPros \\n• A Long range UCAS system based on an aircraft carrier will provide a more survivable \\npersistent reconnaissance and strike capability for the Navy. \\n• It will partially satisfy the counter-nuclear campaign requirement, especially after a \\nrobust SEAD campaign. \\n• The N-UCAS could be built with robust nuclear hardening requirements. \\n• Since it operates from a mobile and defended seabase, its base is more survivable than a \\ndefended land bastion. \\nCons \\n• Even with LO features the N-UCAS will require an effective SEAD campaign to survive \\nduring protracted reconnaissance strike operations. \\n• The deep reconnaissance-strike mission can be satisfied by further upgrades and a larger \\npurchase of the Tomahawk IV. \\n• Total operational cost including attrition may be greater than an equivalent F-35C fleet. \\n• Many of these missions could be satisfied by the F-35C using an F/A-18 buddy tanker. \\n• The F-35C provides the CSG with much greater mission flexibility, especially to provide \\nclose air support and air supremacy. \\n91 For a more complete discussion of the operational possibilities of the N-UCAS operating from a carrier see Robert \\n0.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the history of ground \\nforces in a nuclear environment suggests that their effectiveness is starkly limited. The US will \\nnot be able to mass large ground forces and their associated logistics train within easy range of \\nan adversary\\'s regional long-range strike forces. This contradicts the combat logistics \\nrequirements of high intensity conventional ground force operations. Just supporting a single \\nheavy division equipped with four BCTs, a fires brigade, and an aviation brigade during five \\ndays of heavy combat will require approximately 1 ,500 logistics and escort vehicles operating \\nover a distance of 500 miles from a large theater support base.102 \\nOperating from Stand-off Distances \\nThere are two broad choices for operating ground forces in the shadow of direct nuclear attack. \\nThe prospect of nuclear strikes demands that ground forces be highly mobile, dispersible, \\nflexible, and resilient (armored). They must be able to quickly mass fires and avoid presenting an \\nattractive target to enemy attacks. Thus US ground forces will have to either operate from a very \\nheavily defended bastion some distance from the tactical theater of operations or they will have \\nto operate from a heavily defended seabase some distance off-shore-or both. \\nSpecialized Small Ground Units -In either case, this requirement suggests that ground forces \\nused in a counter-nuclear campaign will be highly specialized and relatively small in number -\\nno more than few brigades. An especially important mission of these special operations-capab le \\nground units will be to conduct deep raids in support of the counter-nuc lear campaign and to \\nprovide targeting and reconnaissance capabilities for stand-off platforms. \\nNew Model Airborne Forces- A new design for the Army airborne forces is needed to conduct \\ndeep maneuver and/or support special operations. It will have be motorized with light armored \\nvehicles and delivered from medium altitude via Joint Precision Airdrop System (JP ADS) \\ntechnology.

AN AGGRESSIVE ADAPTATION STRATEGY \\nOF NEUTRALIZATION AND DEFEAT: \\nOPTION C \\nOn the Conduct of a Counter -Nuclear Campaign \\nThe central premise of this strategy is that the United States can develop a counter-nuclear \\ncampaign capability that is an order of magnitude more effective than the current and \\nprogrammed efforts. There are major technological, operational, and organizational challenges to \\nrealizing such a result. \\nOn Counterforce \\nThe combined effect of the broad advances in counterforce as described in Option A allow the \\nUS to readily attack and destroy all known targets on the surface of the earth, land or sea. With \\nits air supremacy , the US military can readily defeat conventionally equipped and organized \\narmed forces under all weather conditions . What these major advances in combat capabilities \\nhave not provided is military dominance against insurgent forces or nation states armed with \\nlong-range ballistic and cruise missiles. To defeat both classes of threats, the United States will \\nhave to make a sustained investment in a new generation counterforce capability as described in \\nOption B. \\nOn Active Defenses \\nThe Option C invesbnent strategy is more robust than that of Option B. Beyond the aerospace \\ndefense postulated in Option B, there would be the need to develop a boost-phase interceptor \\nplatform that could survive in the face of robust air defenses. Further, there is the possibility of \\narming the next generation AWACS with a lookdown-shootdown capability, optimized to \\ndestroy LO cruise missiles and SIMRBMs. This armed air defense vehicle would have to operate \\nfrom a distant defended bastion. \\nBuilding a robust C41SR Infrastructure \\nAs indicated previously, a nuclear-armed regional opponent may conduct a vigorous counter\\xad\\nreconnaissance campaign against the US LEO satellite infrastructure . This could include the use \\nof non-nuclear (hit to kill) or nuclear-armed interceptors . A less technologically developed \\nopponent might choose to use nuclear armed interceptors to guarantee a kill. The use of these \\nnuclear interceptors by accident or design will cause the energizing of the lower van Allen belt \\nand put at risk all satellites operating in LEO. \\nAttacks against satellites operating at higher altitude, most specifically the Navstar GPS \\nconstellation operating at MEO and EHF communication satellites at GEO by nuclear armed \\ninterceptors using IRBMIICBM rocket boosters are plausible.

These smaller satellites would use a rapid launch capability \\nfrom either a smaller, next generation launcher or the current fleet ofiCBMs and SLBMs. This is \\nthe essence of the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) concept. \\nReliance on Non-Satellite Means -The ORS concept may not prove feasible for cost and \\neffectiveness reasons. The clear alternative is to more heavily rely upon air-breathing means to \\nprovide surrogate intelligence, navigation, and communication services. This could include a \\nmajor investment in two types of unmanned air systems. The first is a Global Hawk or HAA\\xad\\nclass UAS design to provide theater forces with wide-area communications and to act as a \\nsurrogate for the degraded GPS constellation. The second is a UAS designed to conduct deep \\nreconnaissance in hostile airspace. This might be a variant of the proposed N-UCAS that is \\noptimized for reconnaissance. It can provide targeting information to rapid response weapons \\nsuch as HCM or a boost-glide vehicle launched from either a submarine or CONUS. \\nOn EMP and HAND \"Taxes\" \\nThe new long-range strike and active defense capabilities will have to operate in an environment \\nwhere one or more nuclear weapons may have been detonated at a high altitude to \"pump\" the \\nvan Allen belt and degrade satellites in LEO or to generate wide area EMP.

The EMP \"tax\" will range one to \\nfive percent of the total system cost. How much EMP hardening is enough? The answer will \\ndepend upon an assumption of the size and composition of the nuclear challenge faced US \\nforces. \\nLarge Scale Follow-on Ground Operations \\nA key assumption of this option is that the United States may have to forward deploy large \\nground forces in the theater of operation before the completion of a \"successful\" counter-nuclear \\ncampaign. Success would be defmed as the assured destruction of at least 90% of the opponent\\'s \\nnuclear arsenal.

The new rationale for the FCS program should be to \\nmodernize the Army so that it can credibly conduct large scale ground operations against a \\nnuclear armed opponent. The 30 ton family of fighting vehicles will be equipped with more fuel \\nefficient hybrid engines. In a nuclear environment, their heavier weight, lower profile and \\nballistic shape will make them much more survivable than the widely deployed MRAP family of \\narmored vehicles. The latter, with its much high center of gravity, will be more vulnerable to \\nnuclear weapon blast effects. Thus, it may make sense for the FCS to replace portions of the \\nBradley family of vehicles while using MRAPs to replace soft service and support vehicles. \\nThe key enabler of the FCS program is the high bandwidth communications coupled to \\nbattlefield and theater surveillance systems that provide a \"first shot, frrst kill\" capability using \\nstand-off guided munition s. If deployed Army-wide , the enhanced C4ISR suite derived from the \\nFCS program will be consistent with the attributes described above to create units more capable \\nof operating in a nuclear shadowed environment. This C4ISR suite will have be hardened to \\nwithstand the EMP effects associated with second generation high yield nuclear weapons. This \\ncalls for an EMP \"tax\" higher than Option B since involves the modernization of the entire \\nground force. Further, Option C assumes that future operational threats may use low or high \\nyield second generation nuclear weapons-if only to be used as a wide area generator of EMP \\neffects. \\nOn Vertical Maneuver Operations \\nHistorically , advocates of vertical maneuver believed that the extensive use of helicopter s or \\nmore advanced VTOL aircraft could address the nuclear threat problem. Although the Army has \\na large inventory of helicopters to provide combat support to the ground maneuver elements, \\nthese modular aviation brigades are very vulnerable to direct nuclear attack. The aircraft are very \\nshort range, require a large POL supply line, and are very vulnerable due to the \"softness\" of the \\nair and ground support vehicles to nuclear weapons effects.107 \\nThe Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) Concept \\nA new generation of very heavy lift VTOL aircraft could be develop ed after 2020. These VTOL \\naircraft would have a payload of some 30 tons and an unrefueled combat radius of 500 miles. \\nPros \\n• With their VTOL capability, the assault cargo aircraft can operate from a wide range of \\ndispersed airfields thereby greatly increasing the targeting problem of the regional \\nopponent. \\n• FCS equipped BCTs can be maneuvered through the air to conduct the equivalent of a \\n2151 air assault. \\n1&7 Swan and McMichael , \"Mounted Vertical Maneuver A Giant Leap FoJWard in Maneuver and Sustainment \"; and \\nJohnson, Gordon lV and Wilson, \"Air-Mechanization : An Expensive and Fragile Concept.\" \\n45 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This \\ncould allow regional adversaries to penetrate US and allied missile defense systems. \\nSaturation of US and Allied Defenses Through Mass Produ ction of LO Cruise Missiles -Similar \\nto the technology of the turbo-fan powered Tomahawk long-rang e cruise missile, regional states \\nhave begun to master the mass production of a similar generation cruise missile.

Alternatively, a new generation of UAS, both land and sea based, with high \\nsurvivability features is needed to provide targeting information for a large inventory of rapid\\xad\\nresponse strike systems, either the HCM or a conventionally-armed ballistic missile. \\nEffective Munitions -Although there has been major progress in developing a new generation of \\nmunitions, especially those designed to defeat hard targets, there remains the challenge of \\ndefeating superhard and dispersed underground targets. This challenge raises the prospect that \\nsome deeply buried targets can only be attacked by a new generation of nuclear EPW.

At present, Congress bas denied funding for a R&D effort \\nto develop such a weapon. The next administration will have to revisit this issue. \\nComprehensive SEAD -To enable persistent and responsive reconnaissance-strike operations, \\nthe United States will have to maintain a powerful capacity to conduct SEAD operations against \\na wide range of aerospace defenses. Tier Two opponents may have the resources and military \\ncompetence to acquire and deploy very robust air defense systems during the course of the next \\nseveral decades. Any plausible deep reconnaissance-strike operation will require the support of a \\nrobust SEAD capability. One attraction of the rapid deep strike systems such as the HCM and \\nconventionally armed ballistic missile is their use as \"counterbattery\" fires against mobile high \\nperforman ce SAM systems that must radiate to function. \\nSurvivable Basing-The reconnaissance-strike and SEAD units will have be able operate from \\neither defended ships at sea or defended bastions located some distance from the theater of \\noperations . Naval forces provide the option of robustly defended, sea-based mobile \\nreconnaissance strike forces, while air forces, especially with a regional bomber, will have to \\noperate out of intermediate support bases within the theater of operation. These intermediate \\nsupport bases with have to be heavily defended from air, missile, and submarine attacks with \\nnuclear weapons. Simply larding up Guam and Diego Garcia with powerful but unprotected \\nreconnaissance-strike assets is to invite a regional preemptive strike by either long-range \\nprecision attack or nuclear means-a replay of the Clark Air Base disaster of December 8, 1941. \\nNew Model Combined Arms Operations \\nNew Concepts of Operations -The Army and Marine Corps will have to develop a new joint \\noperational concept for major contingencies that includes the prospect of combined operations \\nunder nuclear attack. \\nSustaining from a Bastion -At present, only widebody airlifters such as the C-17 and C-5 can \\nsustain brigade-sized forces over intra-theater distances. This requires that an airfield be seized \\nby either airborne and/or amphibious assault. That forward operating airfield will be very \\nvulnerable to a direct precision and/or nuclear attack. To avoid the use of a single fixed airfield, \\nsome form of aerial support is needed. In the near-term, it will be possible to use JP ADS to \\nprovide support for maneuvering units without relying on a large airfield. Supplies can be \\ndirectly delivered to the maneuver forces using the airlift fleet while it operates at medium \\naltitude (approximate ly 25,000 feet). Alternative concepts discussed above include the \\ndevelopment of a fleet of Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) VTOL cargo assault aircraft or the development \\nof a fleet of semi-buoyant air ships. The former would require a large R&D commitment to \\ndevelop a heavy lift VTOL aircraft with an IOC well after 2020. The latter will have to overcome \\nthe \"giggle factor\\'\\' but may represent a genuine innovation in intra-theater and strategic lift \\ncapability. \\nOperating from the Seabase -As noted, the Navy and Marine Corps are making an innovative \\ninvestment in new seabasing technology.

Another question to be addressed is whether several more \\nseabases should be procured by 2020 even at the expense of other high priority Navy warship \\nprograms. \\nIncreased Role of Armored Forces- While conducting military operations under the threat of \\nnuclear weapons, the most plausible force mix is comprised of the heavy and medium BCTs of \\nthe US Army. Both will have the inherent armor protection and mobility to more effectively \\nsurvive and function after a first generation nuclear weapon detonation. Infantry BCTs, if fully \\nequipped with MRAPs, will have survivability features similar to a Stryker brigade. To ensure \\nthat all BCTs will have their organic logistics and engineering elements equipped with armor \\nprotection, the post-Iraq War MRAP inventory could be used to replace the soft vehicles \\ncurrently deployed with logistic and engineering units. \\n\"Going to Ground\"-With an organic combat engineering capability, the BCTs, and especially \\nthe division and above echelons will have to rapidly build field fortifications to reduce the \\nconsequences of nuclear weapons use. As noted, any in-theater defended bastions will have to be \\nconfigured in a locally dispersed and hardened fashion. \\nDispersed Operations -BCTs will have to be prepared to operate tens of miles from their \\nneighboring BCT. The division echelon will basically be a C4ISR node for the multi-BCT \\noperations and will have little organic fires and logistics capability other than a combat \\nengineering capacity to \"go to ground.\" Both the BCTs and division echelon will rely heavily on \\nnon-organic assets to provide ISR, long-range fires, combat aviation, aerospace defenses and \\nlogistics support. \\nReach Back -The traditional forms of organic combat support and combat service support will \\nhave to be radically pared back to reduce the overall vulnerability of the ground maneuver units \\nto nuclear strikes. Most of these assets, in particular all consumables like water and POL must be \\ndelivered by air from heavily protected bastions or seabases. \\nReliance on Guided Munitions -All indirect fire systems whether organic to the BCT or \\nprovided by outside sources will rely heavily on guided munitions such as the Exca/ibur GPS\\xad\\nguided artillery shell and the GMLRS. Their use will radically reduce the logistics throughput \\nrequirements of these very logistically intensive elements of the ground maneuver units. \\nRefocusing the FCS Program -The central rationale for the FCS program should be to \\nmodernize the Army so that it can credibly conduct large scale ground operations against a \\nnuclear armed opponent. In a nuclear environment, their heavier weight, lower profile, and \\nballistic shape, will make them much more survivable than the widely deployed MRAP family of \\narmored vehicles. \\nThe key enabler of the FCS program is high bandwidth communications coupled to battlefield \\nand theater surveillance systems that provide a \"first shot, first kill\" capability using stand-off \\nguided munitions.

More challenging is the \\ndevelopment of fission-fusion thermonuclear weapons. \\nTier Three powers will have far more capable and diverse systems to deliver their arsenal of 100-\\n300 nuclear weapons. The means of delivery will include second generation solid propellant \\nballistic missiles, both land and sea based, first generation LO and supersonic cruise missiles; \\nlong-range , LO strike aircraft; and supersonic cruise missiles. \\nAt present, all of the mature nuclear powers including China, France, United Kingdom, and very \\nlikely Israel have this Tier Three capability. This expanded arsenal provides additional \\ncapabilities such as: \\nWide Area EMP-Thermonuclear weapons can be used at high altitude to generate very large \\nEMP effects. This provides the regional power with a use option that uses nuclear weapons more \\nfor mass disruption rather than destruction. Further, these weapons could be used to damage US \\nnaval forces on the high seas. \\nMulti-Salvo Operations -Mature regional powers will have the option of conducting limited \\ncounter military strikes against a wide range of targets while holding a future opponent\\'s major \\ncities at risk. \\nThreatening City Annihilation -The major cities of any power can be threatened with complete \\ndestruction by a thermonuclear strike. \\nThe Challenge of Mature, Tier Three Powers: Strategic interactions with mature nuclear powers \\nare likely to tend towards stability and non-kinetic means of resolution , as serious combat is \\nperilously prone to escalation to the nuclear level.

CONCLUSION \\nIn a proliferated environment, the US will need to be able to engage a variety of types of nuclear\\xad\\narmed opponents. \\nNascent or Tier One nuclear powers: Some nations may elect to obtain nuclear capabilities \\nstrictly for deterrent purposes. Reflecting this policy, their arsenals would be tailored for secure \\nsecond strike and counter-value functions in order to assure retaliation. Since their arsenals \\nwould be purely defensive and unrefined , future US dealings with these countries would likely \\nbe limited in nature. Regime change would be taken \"off the table\" in most scenarios. While US \\npolicymakers would have to be concerned with the prospect of escalation to the nuclear level, \\nlimited military operations themselves would not necessarily be radically altered. States that \\nappear to have adopted minimum deterrent postures include China (until recently) and South \\nAfrica. North Korea\\'s current capability, such as it is, probably reflects a minimum deterrent \\nposture. \\nEmergent Tier Two nuclear powers: Some states may seek nuclear weapons not only for \\ndeterrent purposes but also for various operational uses. Some states may deploy lower yield, \\nearth penetrating, neutron (anti-personnel), or other weapons tailored for straightforward \\nwarfighting purposes. Such weapons could be used against the whole spectrum of classic \\nmilitary targets including : deployed forces in the field, staging grounds, depots, airbases, ports, \\nother bases, transportation networks, supply lines, and so forth. \\nSuch weapons could also be used for indirect military purposes such as: area denial, terror and \\ndisorder inducement, and attacks against non-military economic and social targets. Israel, India, \\nand Pakistan all appear to possess such weapons. States may also develop weapons capable of \\nanti-technology effects to destroy or degrade an opponent\\'s C4ISR capabilities, including EMP \\nand anti-satellite functions. \\nThe Shield/Sword Challenge : States such as Iran may fall somewhere in between the above two \\ncategories . For instance, a state may develop nuclear weapons primarily for strategic deterrent \\nfunctions but use this limited, retaliatory arsenal to cover aggressive operations through other \\nmeans, such as supporting proxies in other states. Such powers may see openings for aggression \\nbecause they believe their opponents will be intimidated by the possibility of escalation to the \\nstrategic level. \\nMature, Tier Three nuclear powers: A Tier Three nuclear state such as China becomes a \\nstrategic challenge similar to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Conflict between them and \\nthe United States becomes highly stylized, with both sides showing considerable constraint. \\nLarge scale or militarily decisive war between the United States and a mature nuclear armed \\nstate becomes unworkable while in its place the strategies of deterrence, containment, and \\nrapprochement become paramount. \\n59 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Developing this facility may also deter \"on the fence\" powers from \\nobtaining nuclear weapons at all. Conversely, such capabilities may incentivize Tier One nuclear \\npowers to develop their arsenals to Tier Two or even Tier Three levels. This analysis strongly \\nsuggests the following broad initiatives should be taken by the next administration to address the \\nemerging challenge of nuclear-armed regional powers. \\nLong-Rang e Reconnaissance-Strike -In the defense planning environment of the next decade, \\nthe US must decide if it should invest in a number of new programs to more effectively conduct \\ndeep counter-nuclear operations. Both the Air Force and Navy will have to make hard budgetary \\nchoices as to whether their current programs of record, with their heavy emphasis on tactical \\nfighter modernization, may have be sacrificed to provide resources for these new needs. \\nTraining for Counter-Nucl ear Operations -A new generation of Rolling Sands-type exercises \\nneeds to be initiated to train the joint force in the conduct of offensive and defensive counter\\xad\\nnuclear operations. This effort should be given priority similar to the Navy\\'s commitment to \\nantisubmarine warfare exercises and training. \\nOperating from Defended Bases -Sufficient resources should be made available to provide key \\ntheater ground and seabases with robust active and passive defenses against at least an emerging \\nTier Two nuclear threat. \\nPreparing for Dispersed Operations -While simultaneously maintaining a capacity to conduct \\nprotracted irregular operations, both the US Army and the Marine Corps should make major \\ninvestments in training at least a portion of their forces for operations in a nuclear shadowed \\nenvironment. At minimum, a new generation of field exercises that emphasis the use of air \\nsupport to provide deep maneuver forces with non-organic logistic support and fires should be \\ndeveloped. \\nDetermining the EMP Tax-OSD and Joint Forces Command should sponsor a high level effort \\nto ascertain how much hardening is necessary to provide next generation military capabilities \\nthat can effectively operate on a battlefield electronically affected by multiple nuclear weapon \\ndetonations. \\nLike the Flexible Response plan of the 1960s, the approach here advises firming US capabilities \\nat the lower levels of the nuclear escalation ladder in order to render more flexible the otherwise \\nbrittle commitment to escalate to massive nuclear retaliation in the face of even limited nuclear \\nuse by an opponent. These recommendations do not suggest that the United States is obligated to \\nmeet enemy action correlatively or symmetrically -nuclear retaliation , massive or otherwise, \\nmay be the ·appropriate response- but posits that the United States should have such a capability. \\nFurther, by taking action to prepare for a regional nuclear conflict, US military forces will \\nthereby also obtain a very robust capacity to respond to future regional opponents armed with a \\nlarge arsenal of tactical and theater range precision guided munitions. \\n60 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Following the \\ndecisive demonstration of the power of the \"absolute weapon\" by the United States in 1945, \\nmany feared that nuclear weapons would swiftly spread and that such an eventuality would lead \\nto catastrophe.113 The unexpectedly early detonation of an atomic weapon by the Soviet Union in \\n1949 followed by the detonation of hydrogen bombs by the United States and the Soviet Union \\nin the following half-decade and the development of an atomic weapon by the United Kingdom \\nall seemed to point in this direction. \\nThough the arsenals of the two superpowers rapidly mounted, early fears of rapid and extensive \\nproliferation proved unfounded.11 With the exception of France, all remaining NATO countries \\n(including Canada, which bad participated in the development of the original bomb) forswore \\nnuclear weapons, as did Japan. The major reason for this forbearance was the extended US \\nnuclear deterrent commitment which, despite considerabl e anxiety about its reliability in Europe, \\nwas sufficiently credible during the Cold War to dissuade countries fully capable of developing \\nnuclear weapons from doing so. \\nFurthermore , the strong US opposition to its allies\\' obtaining independent arsenals weighed \\nheavily against proliferation during the early, testiest years of the Cold War when maximal \\nAmerican leverage coincided with center-right political dominance in Europe. By the 1970s, \\ncenter-left political ascendancy and significant anti-nuclear sentiment in Europe combined with a \\nmassive American nuclear commitment to render the issue of further independent nuclear powers \\nlargely moot. \\nDynamics were similar among US allies elsewhere, where the US defense commitment and \\nopposition to allied nuclear capabilities combined to stem proliferation. Japan swore off any \\naspirations for nuclear weapons in its constitution and settled under the American nuclear \\numbrella. South Korea, defended by nuclear-capable US forces, also operated in a comparable \\nstrategic situation. Though Seoul flirted with an independent nuclear capability in the 1970s, the \\nUnited States pressured it to abandon the program. Despite a more ambiguous relationship with \\nTaiwan, a similar dynamic existed there as well, with the United States pressuring the Republic \\nof China to abandon its independent nuclear program in the 1960s. Meanwhile, with the \\nexception of the subsequently-regretted decision to share the technology with Beijing, the Soviet \\nUnion evinced no desire to spread nuclear capability among its Warsaw Pact allies or other client \\nstates. \\n113 See, for instance, the Baruch Plan of 1946, which stated to the United Nations that \"we must elect either World \\nPeace or World Destruction .\" See \"The Baruch Plan,\" at \\nhttp;//www.atomicarchive .com/Docs!Deterrence/BaruchP)an .shtml. \\n114 For those concerns, see John F.

Before the \\nunveiling of the absolute weapon, the logic of industrial era warfare pointed in the direction of \\nmassing force and frrepower to achieve overwhelming mastery over one\\'s enemy. World War IT \\ncarried this logic to its fullest conclusion, as fleets of tanks, airplanes, and ships delivered \\nmaximal firepower against the full range of enemy targets. Mass and power, with allowance for \\nmobility, were mutually reinforcing. \\nThe introduction of the atomic bomb -and especially fusion weapons several years later -\\ndecisively broke the connection between mass and firepower. A single multi-kiloton bomb could \\nnow deliver vastly more destruction than the 1,500-strong bomber fleets that had struck German \\ncities during the war. In theory, as the arsenals of the United States and the USSR grew, atomic \\nweapons in all their power could make any and all strategic efforts effectively pointless. \\nThenceforth, all military operations would have to take place under the shadow of this reality. \\nThe history of military affairs since that point has been in key respects an effort to understand \\nhow to fight, with what weapons, and with what limitations under the nuclear shadow. \\nIn the United States, the attempt to incorporate the bomb into military planning proved \\nfrustrating and difficult In the early years of the Truman Administration, atomic weapons were \\nfew in number and ill-suited to operational , rather than political-strategic, use. For political \\nreasons, the Truman Administration elected not to employ nuclear arms during the Korean War \\nand more or less stumbled into a limited war framework . The Eisenhower Administration, \\nhowever, led by the President himself, took a very different tack, believing that nuclear weapons \\nwere usable, both as sources of leverage and at the operational level. \\nEisenhower used nuclear threats to bring the Korean conflict to a close, issued a commanding \\ndirective to incorporate nuclear weapons into war planning, and generally adopted a solicy of \\n\"massive retaliation \" (presumptively strategic-nu clear) against Communist aggression.\\' 2 In light \\nof this policy, the Administration focused the much reduced post-Korean War defense budgets \\non the Air Force and Strategic Air Command , which was tasked with the destruction of the \\nCommunist heartlands in the event of war. Faced with this shift in emphasis, the other services, \\nand especially the Army, stru~gled to adopt their missions and forces to a nuclear battlefield and \\nmuch more austere budgets.13 \\nThe Army\\'s effort in the 1950s to adapt to the nuclear battlefield was one of the most extended \\nexperiments in rendering ground forces operable in a nuclear environment.

Guided by the themes of \"flexibility, mobility, and \\ndispersion\" in response to the devastating power of nuclear attacks, the Pentamic Division was \\nexpected to be able both to employ and survive strikes by nuclear weapons. The division would \\nbe able to compensate for the necessity of dispersing to survive by using tactical nuclear \\nweapons such as the \"Honest John,\" \"Corporal,\" and \"Davy Crockett.\" These asymmetrically \\npowerful systems would solve the problem of how light, lean, and dispersed units could bring to \\nbear the firepower necessary for victory on the modem battlefield without relying on massed and \\nlogistically intensive conventional artillery fires.134 \\nDespite the Pentamic concept\\'s alleged promise, the effort was overwhelmingly judged a failure. \\nBeyond the organizational and structura l difficultie s the effort confronted, the simple reality was \\nthat the Pentamic Division could not credibly survive and fight the nation\\'s wars on a nuclear \\nbattlefield.135 Once nuclear weapons, even tactical-strength ones, were employed on any \\nsignificant scale, the Pentamic Division would be incapacitated, if not entirely destroyed . Soon \\nthe Army shifted toward an armored and mechanized force, the Reorganization of Anny \\nDivisions (ROAD) concept that emerged in the early 1960s.

The Kennedy Administration\\'s strategy of \"Flexible Response,\" endorsed by NATO \\nin 1967, called for the services, and especially the Army, once again to focus on non-nuclear \\nwarfigbting in order credibly to deter the Soviets at all levels of strategic interaction and to give \\nthe President the fullest range of options to counteract aggression.

So dominant and effective \\nwere American conventional forces that many, including military personnel, judged nuclear \\nweapons to be no longer usable, given the strength of modem conventiona l forces, the enduring \\nnuclear taboo, and the \"madness\" of nuclear weapons. Indeed, by the first decades of the 21st \\ncentury, nuclear wamghting seemed a distant problem for the US military, even an anachronism . \\nTHE SOVIET EXPERIENCE \\nThough the history of Soviet and Warsaw Pact planning for nuclear operations remains in large \\npart obscure, a general picture has emerged. During the Cold War, Soviet theorizing on warfare \\ntended to remain more faithful to the \"Clausewitzean\" notion that warfare, even in the nuclear \\nage, remained the servant of political purposes; therefore nuclear weapons could be used in the \\nservice of rational objectives. The Soviet saw this as the only inte~retation of the introduction of \\nnuclear weapons commensurate with Marxist-Leninist principles.1 7 \\nTherefore , the Soviets, though they became increasingly interested in the possibility of solely \\nconventiona l warfare later in the Cold War, appear to have never deviated from the position that \\nnuclear weapons could and likely would have been a part of any conflict with NATO, and that \\nmilitary operations could be conducted successfully in such an environment. This point seems to \\nhave been confmned by the opening of satellite nation archives in the 1990s, which showed that \\nthe Warsaw Pact had realistically ~tanned and trained to employ limited nuclear strikes against \\nNATO, at least in some scenarios.1 8 \\n137 For more on Soviet military doctrine, see W.C.

Each \\nis described below.141 \\nBLAST EFFECTS \\nBlast effects are essentially instantaneous and the most destructive for physical structures and \\npeople. Immediatel y following detonation , a high-pressure shock wave develops and moves \\noutward from the point of the detonation . Similar to conventional explosives, the majority of the \\ndestructive power of a nuclear weapon results from the blast effects. The effects on infrastructur e \\nand services can be severe and long lasting, particularly within the 5 psi ring. Disruptions will \\nalso be significant within the 2 psi ring, but can be overcome more rapidly. Terrain features can \\nprovide some protection from this effect (for example, by being on the opposite side of a hill) or \\ncan intensify it (by being on the facing side of a hill). (See Table 1 for the effects of a 10 kiloton \\nnuclear detonation.) \\nPROMPT IONIZING RADIATION EFFECTS \\nPrompt radiation is also essentially instantaneous. For doses of 600 to 1 ,000 rem, it is estimated \\nthat 90-100% of casualties, respectively, will be fatal even with medical treatment. For doses of \\n300 rem, it is estimated that 10 percent of casualties will be fatal with treatment. Below 200 rem \\nthere will be no fatalities from prompt radiation but people will suffer symptoms of radiation \\nsickness. (See Table 1) \\nTHERMAL RADIATION EFFECTS \\nThermal radiation (heat) will cause burns to skin directly exposed to heat from the detonation. \\nSecondary effects of nuclear weapons include fires that are started by thermal radiation and by \\ngas and electrical lines that are damaged by the blast. (See Table 1) \\n141 The following summary of nuclear weapon effects uses the analysis of David Howell at the RAND Corporation; \\nGlasstone and Dolan, The Effects of Nuclear Weapons; and other sources. \\n73 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The effects of long-term exposure to low levels of fallout \\nradiation are primarily an increased incidence of cancer and genetic mutations , although the \\nmagnitude of the effect is a matter of debate. The standard approach used by US regulatory \\nagencies is to assume that the effect is linear and to use the factor of 1 additional cancer death for \\nevery 2,500 people exposed to a cumulative dose of 1 rem, whether it was absorbed in 1 month \\nor 10 years.

For example, the EMP effects for a 10-20 \\nkiloton ground burst may only extend a few miles from the site of the detonation. A ground or \\nlow-altitude burst can also destroy computers within a limited range. It is also likely to affect \\ncommunications networks , but the duration of the disruption is unknown . \\nHEMP effects are less well understood, but could be substantial depending on the height of burst \\nand weapon yield. In considering HEMP effects, it must be kept in mind that assessments in this \\nrealm of nuclear weapons effects are derivative of a very limited number of high-altitude tests \\nand that there is considerable debate and uncertainty about the physical phenomena involved and \\nthe magnitude of such effects.

Such damage can potentially \\nbe very widespread: the Johnson Atoll tests, for instance, caused street lights to fail, burglar \\nalarms to go off, and power line circuit breakers to open 800 miles away in Hawaii. \\n75 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

HEMP \\noccurs in three phases-early, intermediate, and late. While the overall pulse is broadban~ each \\nphase covers a distinct energy range (see Figure 1). \\nA high-altitude nuclear explosion produces a large quantity of gamma rays, which travel radially \\naway from the blast and, given the thin atmosphere, are able to propagate a significant distance. \\nAs those gamma rays traveling towards the earth reach the higher density atmosphere (20-40 kro \\nabove the earth's surface), they collide with air molecules, producing free (Compton) electrons. \\nThese Compton electrons, in turn, interact with the earth's magnetic field, producing the early\\xad\\ntime (El) pulse that radiates towards the ground at the speed of light (see Figure 2). The early\\xad\\ntime pulse lasts only a microsecond before completely dissipating. During this microsecon~ \\nhowever, the pulse produces electromagnetic fields of up to 50,000 (or more for specially \\ndesigned weapons) volts per meter (V/m) in strength. \\nThe intermediate (E2) pulse is generated by gamma rays delayed by scattering collisions or those \\nproduced by inelastic neutron interactions with air molecules. This phase is significantly less \\nintense (producing hundreds, rather than thousands of V/m) than the first. It is similar to \\nlightning. \\nThe late phase (E3) is also less intense but lasts much longer. During this phase, fields of up to 1 \\nkilovolt can last for up to several minutes. This can be particular ly worrisome for long-line \\ntelecommuni cations and power transmission systems which act as antennas to couple this E3 \\nenergy in ways that might be very destructive . \\n76 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

On the hand, \\nthese and many military systems have been designed to operate in the face of electromagnetic \\ninterference and are relatively \"hard\" to EMP effects especially those caused by a low-yieLd first \\ngeneration fission weapon. \\nHemp Effects on Other Systems \\nHigh-altitude nuclear explosions can also damage satellites or interfere with remote sensing and \\nsatellite-ground communications. In particular , a HAND would produce both an EMP and \\n\"pump-up\" the van Allen radiation belt around the earth. This radiation could disable all non\\xad\\nhardened satellites in low earth orbit within a few days to months. Analysis by DTRA suggests \\nthat a single 20-kiloton nuclear detonation at the appropriate altitude will induce the electronic \\nequivalent of accelerated Alzheimer\\'s disease for most satellites operating in LEO. While most \\nmilitary satellites are hardened against radiation effects (both natural and threat-related), almost \\nno commercial satellites are hardened beyond normal background leveLs, leaving them \\nvulnerable if nuclear weapons pump-up the radiation belts. Satellites operating at MEO and GEO \\nwill not be affected by this phenomenon . Furthermore, satellites operating at those altitudes are \\nmuch more robust since they are designed to survive bursts of solar radiation outside of the \\nprotective cover of the van Allen belt. \\nEven if satellites survive a HAND (or are out of range) in the near-term, the explosion itseLf may \\ninterrupt satellite-ground communication s and satellite sensing for tens of hours. The blast \\ncreates large, highly ionized regions in the upper atmosphere . Depending on the weapons yield, \\nheight-of-burst, and location of the explosion, the ionized regions will interfere with \\nelectromagnetic waves crucial for satellite communications, satellite remote sensing, or earth \\nobservation. \\nPreventative Measures \\nWhile strategic nuclear forces and strategic C3 systems are hardened against EMP, current \\nconventiona l forces lack comprehensive hardening against EMP, and commerc ial systems \\npossess almost no protection against EMP attack. Further, tactical unit training does not currently \\ninclude HEMP scenarios. \\nIt is generally estimated that designing hardened equipment can add 1-5% to their cost. On the \\nother hand, retrofitting HEMP hardening can be much more costly. There are some \\nstraightforward, more immediate steps-which interfere with operations to varying degrees\\xad\\nthat can be taken to mitigate the effects of HEMP on unhardened equipment in-theater: \\nInstall surge protectors specifically designed for EMP (lightning surge protectors are \\ninadequate), which are inexpensive and effective at clipping the pulses associated with \\nEMP on power and signal lines. \\nUse radios operating at UHF and Super High Frequency (SHF), which are less susceptible to \\nEMP. \\n80 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

One of  the \\nmajor  potential areas of conflict is over the South China Sea, where tensions have been brewing \\nfor years  over maritime boundar ies implied by China’s “nine -dash line,”  the status of Ta iwan  \\n(supported by the United States) , and recent Chinese  unilateral  construction of military \\ninstallations in the  disputed  Spratly and Paracel islands.  \\n \\nChina currently does not dominate the South China Sea , and its many boundary disputes and \\ninstallations  suggest  it seeks that control . The South China Sea is not only home to immense \\nnatural resources ( including oil and natural gas ), but greater control would also give China \\nleverage over i ts neighbors as well as  the 21% of global commerce that passes through the sea .1 \\n \\nRecently, some scholars have analogized the South China Sea to the Caribbean Sea.2 The seas  \\nshare some features. B oth are comparably sized , semi -enclosed, surrounded by a number of \\ncontinental and island nations , and  both are critical trading routes.  The United States also once \\nhad a relationship with the Caribbean much like China does today with the South China Sea; the \\nUnited States  was the biggest regional power, but it did not do minate the Caribbean  because it  \\ndid not control the sea lines of communication (SLOC)  and because colonial powers outside of \\nthe hemisphere held Caribbean territory . The United States only came to dominate the Caribbean \\nfollowing the Spanish -American War  in 1898 .3 \\n \\nCatalytic conflicts can produce great change in regional balances of power. Through war, states \\nmay acquire territory or bases, establish supply and communication lines, and reveal capabilities \\nthat had previously been unte sted, as the United States did in 1898 . Studying these historical \\nconflicts can also help navigate present challenges and uncertainties.  \\n \\nThis paper has two guiding research question s: how did U.S. victory in the Spanish -American \\nWar lead to sea control i n the Caribbean, and  what does that historical experience reveal about \\nChina and the dynamics in the South China Sea today? After providing a brief background, t his \\npaper analyzes the Spanish -American W ar in three subsections  as they relate to sea control : the \\nlead up  to the conflict , the conflict itself, and the consequences. Afterward , it compares the 1898 \\ncase to China in the South China Sea today  and discusses the several ways in which  the former \\ncan inform the latter.  \\n  \\n \\n1 Researchers at the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimate that $3.37 trillion out of a total world \\ntrade of $15.9 trillion in 2016 passed through the sea. That figure varies. See: China Power Team (2021a). For a \\nmap of resources in the So uth China Sea, see: Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (2021c).   \\n2 In this paper, the term “Caribbean” implies the Greater Caribbean, which includes the Gulf of Mexico. Two \\nscholars who have studied this geographical analogy recently are: Holmes (2014) ; Kaplan (2014).   \\n3 There are many names for the Spanish -American War, including the War with Spain, the War of 1898, the \\nSpanish -Cuban -American War, and the Spanish -Cuban -Filipino -American War. This study uses the term “Spanish -\\nAmerican War,” since that is most common, though it does not wish to discount other players in the conflict.  \\n   Though the United States also acquired Pacific holdings from the war, it did not gain sea control anywhere in the \\nAsia-Pacific to the level it did in the Caribbean. For t hat reason, sea control in the Caribbean is the focus of this \\npaper. Still, this study does discuss the Pacific to a degree, since it was an important theater of war.

It \\nbegan in response to a Cuban rebellion, beginning in 1895, against Spanish colonial control \\namidst  economic devastation.4 In an attempt to put down the rebellion, Spain employed brutal \\ntactics. T he worst of these was  its reconcentrado  (re-concentration)  policy, where countryside \\ncivilian populations were forcibly moved to central locations under the watch of the Spanish \\nArmy. There, Cubans endured overcrowding, mistreatment, starvation, and disease. By the time \\nU.S. President William McKinley entered his first year, over half a mi llion Cubans had died as a \\nresult of this policy and the suppression of the rebellion.  \\n \\nLike his predecessor Grover Cleveland, McKinley resisted calls for U.S. military intervention. \\nHe did diplomatically press the Spanish to reform their military and gove rnance policy, but he \\nwanted the issue resolved peacefully.  As the months wore on , the conflict appeared to McKinley \\nto be stuck in a stalemate . Two events, the leaking of the de Lôme letter to the New York press \\nand the tragic sinking of the U.S.S. Maine  (killing 266 U.S. sailors), ratcheted up the stakes of \\nthe conflict.  Though McKinley did not blame Spain for the Maine  and continued to search for a \\npeaceful resolution, he also requested $50 million from congress for national defense to help \\nprepare the United States for war, if it were to come  (the bill  funded additional ships and coastal \\nfortifications ).5 Ultimately, on April 11, 1898, a s a response to the humanitarian emergency in \\naddition to a fear of disorder nearby  (not sea control) , McKinley reque sted authorization to use \\nforce against Spain.6 Congress granted it a week later, after which McKinley ordered a naval \\nblockade of Havana and called for volunteers to join the U.S. Army.  \\n \\nThe war, lasting from April until August 1898, was quick and decis ive.

The United \\nStates still only had five modern battleships  available for the war and two armored cruisers , but it \\nalso had a number of other cruisers , torpedo boats, and steel gunboats.15 All in all, 196 vessels \\nparticipated in the war .16 The navy was able to supplement its fleet from McKinley’s $50 million \\nreque st from Congress on March  7, 1898, $3 1 million of which bought two new cruisers, \\nammunition, coal, and leased merchant ships from abroad.17 Scholars have ranked the U.S. navy \\nas somewhere around fifth or sixth in the world at this point.18 \\n \\nThe modernization of the navy’s hardware was matched by a long-term professionalization of \\nthe service  in education, training, discipline, and accountability .19 Elements of this process \\nstarted even earlier with the establishment of the U.S. Naval Institut e in 1873, though it was not \\nuntil the 1880s that congress took more interest in developing the nav y.20 In 1882, t he year \\nbefore congress authorized the first steel warships , the navy established the Office of Naval \\nIntelligence  (ONI) .

The Spanish Pacific fleet was essentially \\nparked in Canacao Bay, a small bay within  the larger Manila Bay. The entrance to Manila Bay \\nwas unprotected by mines  and the garrisons in Manila were poorly fortified. The Spanish \\nsquadron, therefore, was a sitting duck.

Fewer than 2.5% actually  hit their targets, but it \\nwas sufficient to win.35 The U.S. suffered zero deaths.  \\n \\nAfter his victory, Dewey requested army reinforcements to seize  the city of Manila  as a military \\nprecaution  against other imperial powers, the Spanish Army, and Filipino rebels eager to re -\\nclaim their capital . Three waves of U.S. troops, totaling 11,000 , arrived by Jul y 25, 1898 .36 The \\nSpanish were deeply aware that they were outmatched . Instead of surrendering outright (and \\nsuffering condemnation  and a court -martial  back home), th rough the Belgian consul,  the Spanish \\nGovernor -General Fermín Jáudenes,  U.S. General Wesley Merritt, and Dewey  agreed to  a staged \\nbattle on August 13 .37 The U.S. “won” that engagemen t and additionally blocked Filipino rebels  \\nunder General Emilio Aguinaldo  from the city (who had helped U.S. forces throughout the \\nsumme r). The battle was  actually  moot, given that Spain had surrendered  hours before  on August \\n12 in Washington, D.C. , though no one knew that in Manila at the time.  \\n \\nThe U.S. victory in Manila Bay and later, Manila, were compounded by the U.S. annexation of \\nHawaii on July 6, 1898  through  a joint resolution in congress  as well as  by the bloodless seizure \\nof Guam on Ju ne 21.38 Within one summer, the United States became a major Pacific maritime \\npower, especially because it now controlled several more coaling stations in the Pacific , critical \\nsources of fuel for ocean -crossing ships . It already held the Aleutian Islands in the n orth and had \\ncoaling station s in Pago Pago (Samoa) as well as in Pearl Harbor. Now it formally held Hawaii, \\nand was in effective control of Guam and Manila.  These acquisitions  did not ensure dominance  \\nin the Pacific. I n some ways , they  caused new vulnerabi lities. The Germans, French, Dutch, \\nBritish, Chinese, Russians, and Japanese all held territory and coaling stations  in the Asia-Pacific \\nregion  as well. But the balance of maritime power was now more complex and more multipolar.  \\n \\nThe outcome in the Caribbe an was more one -sided for sea control. The second major naval \\nengagement took place outside of Santiago  de Cuba (hereafter: Santiago) , on the southern coast \\nof Cuba.

The United  States had received intelligence that Cervera had left Cape \\nVerde  on April 2 9, presumably  for the Caribbean .40 After a few weeks of playing cat and mouse \\n(based on probability assessments of where Cervera would plan to coal his fleet),41 through the \\nU.S. Army Signal Corps and a Cuban agent in Havana, Cervera was tracked down at Santiag o, \\nCuba .42 Sampson and Schley moved to blockade the port. To ensure continued access to coal, \\nSampson ordered a battalion of marines to seize Guantánamo Bay as a coaling station , which \\nthey did on June 10  with the help of  Cuban rebel forces and intelligence (eastern  Cuba was \\nalready  a rebel stronghold) .43  \\n \\nRealizing that mines and shore batteries would prevent a successful campaign similar to \\nDewey’s in Manila, Sampson requested a landing of U.S. Army troops to take down the shore \\nbatteries to allow his ships  time to clear the mines  and then  to destroy Cervera’s fleet. A gross \\nmiscommunication (and lack of a unified commander) led to a land campaign under General \\nWilliam R. Shafter that aimed instead to seize the city o f Santiago  aided by  Cuban General \\nCalixto García  and the rebels .44 This had the ironic and unintended effect of prompting Cervera  – \\nwho was deeply aware how much weaker his ships were45 – to attempt an escape  from the \\nharbor . Within a few hours, the U.S. fleet s ank or ran ashore  every ship of Cervera’s , suffering \\nthe loss of one U.S. life . A ground campaign in Santiago and Spain’s surrender of eastern Cuba \\nsoon followed , after which Sampson and U.S. Army General Leonard Miles moved to seize \\nPuerto Rico. Th e Puerto Rico  campaign was underway when Spain su rrendered on August 12.  \\n \\nAt the time of Spain’s surrender, therefore, the balance of maritime power had shifted \\nremarkably in the Caribbean. The United States was in effective control of Puerto Rico and Cuba \\nand had set up a coaling station in Guantánamo Bay. The site of Guantánamo was chosen for its \\nvicinity to Santiago , though not because of its implications for sea control . Commodore Schley \\nhad threatened to leave the Santiago area for  Key West to coal, because the seas were not calm \\nenough to coal by collier. Secretary of the Navy John Long did not want Schley to leave the \\nvicinity, because doing so would allow Cervera to escape unnoticed. L ong suggested occupying \\nGuantánamo instead , to use as a coaling station.46 Neverth eless, Guantánamo was one of the \\nmost strategic positions in the Caribbean, overseeing  maritime traffic in the Windward Passage \\nbetween Cuba and Hispaniola. Over the next sev eral years, as naval strategists debated what \\nnaval bases to pursue, they would keep continue to value Guantánamo higher than anything \\nelse.47 \\n \\n \\n40 See: Rentfrow (2014), p. 139; Trask (1996, 1981 original), p. 11.  \\n41 Sampson believed Cervera would coal at Puerto Rico.

The first was the creation of \\na new regional naval  squadron. The United States established several regional naval squadrons \\nover the first few decades of the nineteenth century. After the Civil War, these were reorganized \\nand renamed into four “stations” that covered the globe , which  remained the case until the \\nSpanish -American War.48 Following the war, in 1902, a permanent Caribbean Squadron was \\nestablished , which  implied  a sharper strategic focus on the Caribbea n. 49 As the Naval War Board \\nnoted in 1898, the Caribbean was “one of the most interesting and vital regions of the world t o \\nthe United States, considered from the viewpoint of commerce and of war.”  It also referred to the \\nCaribbean as the “American Mediterranean” and the need  for overseas bases.50 \\n \\nLastly, the war witnessed a sevenfold  expansion of the U.S. Army Signal Corps,  which not only \\nprovided the intelligence on Cervera’s squadron’s location, but also set up critical telegraph links \\nto Washington from Guantánamo Bay  and from Ponce, Puerto Rico. Previously, following the \\nCivil War, the signal corps had served primarily meteorological purposes. The war resurrected \\nand expanded it.51 These  many  institutional changes were tied to the duration of the war, but \\nelements of them, as we will see below, continued well beyond the fleeting four months of \\nconflict.  \\n \\nTactic s, Logistics,  and Their I mplications  for Maritime Power  \\n \\nIn retrospect, the military balance s harply  favored the Americans, though this was not fully \\nunderstood  at the time. Intelligence from Spain led certain U.S. military leaders to believe that \\nthey had the advantage, but not by a significant margin .52 This assessment seems to have been \\nbased mostly o n specifications of the ships, not true functionality or the training of Spanish \\nsailors.53 Spain’s most powerful ship in the Atlantic, the Cristóbal Colón , for instance, could not \\nactually use its largest guns, and many other destroyers and torpedo boats were in a state of \\ndisrepair.54 Thus, Dewey’s one -sided victory was a surprise  and McKinley waited to neutralize \\nCervera’s fleet before advancing land campaigns in Cuba .55 True knowledge of the relative \\nbalance of power makes it difficult to imagine a Span ish victory. Once engaged, the Spanish \\nwere always going to be  severely outgunned  and overpowered . Still, the  Spanish  could have \\ninflicted  more damage than they did .56 Because of the ongoing rainy season and skyrocketing \\ncases of infectious disease among U.S. troops ( deaths  from disease outnumbered battle deaths \\n \\n48 Hattendorf (2011), pp. 231 -244. \\n49 Challener (1973), p. 22.  \\n50 Both quoted in id. pp. 34, 36.  \\n51 See: Raines (1998/1999).  \\n52 Cooper (1993), p. 14.  \\n53 For Rooosevelt’s intelligence on Spanish vessels as Assistance Secretary of the Nav y in 1898, see: Bradford \\n(1993), pp. 251 -254. \\n54 Trask (1996, 1981 original), p. 66.

By prolonging it , Spain might have \\nsecured itself a better bargaining position and maintained some stake in the Caribbean.  Visiting \\nthe tactical processes, decisions, mistakes, and ingenuities on both sides  (rather than relying on \\ngeneral trends  and outcomes ) therefore nuances the assessment of Spanish and American control \\nover maritime environments.  \\n \\nThe United Sta tes held several advantages in naval training and quality of  vessels, but poor \\nplanning o n the part of the  Spanish masked some U.S. vulnerabilities. Spain did not fortify its \\ngarrisons in Manila effectively, it did not mine Manila Bay well (if at all), nor did it use its \\nrelative strength in coaling station availability to its tactical advantage. Had Spain managed to \\nextend the battle in Manila a handful of days, or exploited windows of opportunity in Santiago \\nsay when Schley left to coal in Key West (before Guantánamo had been seized),  they could have \\ninflicted more damage and controlled their environment more effectively.58 Cervera had actually \\noutmaneuvered Sampson and Schley twice before being discovered in Santiago, but he never \\nused t hat to his advantage. He also mistakenly interpreted Shafter’s Santiago campaign as \\ncoming from a position of strength.59  \\n \\nFurthermore, unbeknownst to the Spanish, the  U.S. Army Fifth Corps, which landed outside of \\nSantiago,  had never actually practiced a mphibious landings , nor any brigade or divisional \\nmaneuvers .60 The large landing of 16,000 troops involving 12 warships and 30  transport ships \\nwas a complete experiment that happened to transpire smoothly, partly because U.S. troops were \\nnever fired upon  by the Spanish  while landing .61 Had Spain more effectively followed U.S.  \\nmovement s, mobilized their own troops, and disrupted the U.S. landing , they would have \\nundoubtedly affected the unfolding of the Santiago  campaign, which would have  also affected \\nthe naval campaign.  \\n  \\nJoint operations  of the U.S. military went surprisingly well overall, despite  the lack of practice \\nand lack of institutional strategizing and planning .62 No joint operations field manuals existed at \\nthis point.63 Compounding this potential weakness was the lack of a unified commander  (and \\nvague instructions from McKinley)  in joint operations . In most circumstances of the war, this did \\nnot lead to any problems. In the execution of the Santiago campaign, however, th is became a \\nmajor issue before it resolved accidentally  in a stroke of luck for the Americans . In their June  20 \\nmeeting , Rear Admiral Sampson had asked  General  Shafter to take out shore batteries so that \\nSampson could clear mines  in Santiago Bay  before  firing on  Cervera’s fleet. Aiding the naval \\ncampaign was the premise of Shafter’s arrival in the first place. Despite this agreement, Shafter \\ndecided  instead  to attempt to seize the city, making only modest progress that Sampson \\nconsidered a setback for the n aval campaign  (Shafter actually would have retreated from his \\n \\n57 “American War and Military Operations Casualties” (2020), p. 2.  \\n58 Dewey and his ships would have been stranded in Manila. In his slow approach to Santiago, Schley informed his \\nsuperiors that he would need to head to Key West to coal, which is when Secretary Long suggested seizing \\nGuantánamo. Schley forged ahead anyway . Before too long, Schley managed to coal at sea by collier, resolving the \\nsituation, but it was a critical lapse of judgment not to follow Long’s orders first.

Cervera did not know \\nSampson would be leaving – he had planned the escape the night before in response to Shafter’s \\nground campaign.65 But he noticed the weakened blockade and left when Sa mpson steamed to \\nmeet Shafter. Ironically, therefore, Shafter’s mistaken ly-executed  ground  campaign hastened the \\nend of the conflict, but it was entirely unintended ; he was not trying to force Cervera out . What is \\nmore is that Shafter and Sampson were them selves unfit for military service. Both men were \\nmorbidly obese, one was sick with gout (and struggled to leave his tent), while the other likely \\nhad multiple -infarct  dementia .66 Together, the lack of inter -service coordination, a unified \\ncommander, and regular medical exams were sharp weaknesses in the U.S. military’s ability to \\nplan and execute  missions  effectively.  \\n \\nConsequences of the War for Caribbean Sea Control  \\n \\nShort to M edium -Term Consequences  (1898 -1903) : \\nTerritory, Larger Military, Guantánamo , Naval Strategy, and Gunnery  Reform  \\n \\nThe newest and most salient  vectors of sea control and maritime power were territorial. As noted \\nabove, as a direct consequence of the war and formalized by the Paris Peace Treaty, the United \\nStates annexed the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.67 Hawaii had been annexed earlier in \\n1898, and the United States  formally  governed Cuba until 1902. A treaty the following year gave \\nthe United Stat es indefinite permission to lease a naval station at  Guantánamo .68 The size of the \\nmilitary  (in personnel and in ships and equipment)  increased to meet those additional demands of \\ngovernance. Partly, this was in response to a colonial war in the Philippine s that lasted from 1899 \\nuntil 1902 (and in scattered forms, for another decade) , but absent that war, the military would \\nhave grown anyway  to govern its new territories . The total size of the military was 44,000 strong  \\nin 1897, and after the Spanish -American War , it never dipped below 100,000 again , even well \\nafter the rebellion in the Philippines  had been defeated .69  \\n \\nThe war additionally shed light and attention on strategic sites of sea control  in the Caribbean , in \\nparticular, Key West in Florida  and Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. The army had several training \\nsites in the south (including in New Orleans, Tampa, Mobile, and Chickamauga Park ), and Key \\nWest became the effective headquarters of Sampson’s North Atlantic Fleet. Guantánamo, as \\nnoted , was chosen for its vicinity to Santiago .

The United States won the Spanish -American War \\nbecause of blunt force applied overwhelmingly. In the two major naval campaigns at Manila and \\nSantiago, U.S. ships outgunned their opponents not based on aim or maneuvers, but by s heer \\nvolume. Of the 16,000  shell s lobbed in the air  between Manila and Santiago , only 1 .8% ever hit \\ntheir targets.89 This fact helped the case of Admiral William S. Sims, who had been working to \\nintroduce innovations in naval gunnery methods honed by the B ritish, including “continuous \\naim” and telescope sight. As the newly appointed Inspector of Target Practice in 1902, Sims had \\nhis chance to revolutionize the navy’s “fire -control” system, which he did.90 \\n \\nMedium to Long -Term Consequences  (1903 -onward) : \\nPattern -setting, The Danish West Indies , Medical Innovation, the Panama Canal, and \\nInstitutional Reform  \\n \\nThe Spanish -American War set a  precedent for  interactions with Latin America that was \\npattern ed for decades. Not only did McKinley’s foreign policy deeply affect the foreign policy of \\nhis immediate presidential successors, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft (both \\nserved  in McKinley ’s administration ), but it also affected Woodrow Wilson, who came from a \\ndifferent political party.  “No war ever transformed us quite as the war with Spain transformed \\nus,” Wilson  wrote in  The Atlantic  in 1902 .91 This pattern of interaction involved heavy -handed \\nresponses  to instability in Central  America  and the Ca ribbean  that signaled a willingness to use \\nmilitary force  frequently . The Roosevelt Corollary, in other words, built off of McKinley’s \\ndecision. Between 1900 and 1917 interventions in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, \\nNicaragua, Mexico, and Cuba (ag ain) were enabled by a larger military, greater sea control,  and \\nbases  at Guantánamo and Puerto Rico , all of which were consequences of the Spanish -American \\nWar. But more than that, the process was self -perpetuating; once the precedent was set and the \\ninteraction normalized, it was easier to imagine policy responses that involved the military.  \\n \\nAnother medium -term consequence was the acquisition of even further  territory in the \\nCaribbean. As noted in the section above, the navy was unable to secure the many bases it \\ndesired in the Caribbean, with the exception of Guantánamo (enshrined in the treaty with Cuba), \\nand Culebra, which the United States had formally an nexed as part of Puerto Rico. Once th e \\nadditional requests  were denied, the navy changed its strategy away from bas ing and toward  \\npreemptive seizure of ports in the instance of German movement toward the Caribbean. Still, two \\nareas of territorial interest remained, both within the navy as well as among the political class: \\nthe Danish West Indies ( today  known as the Danish Virgin Islands)  and the Panama Canal.  \\n \\n \\n88 Consideration of this strategy might have begun a bit earlier, in late 1900, when it was less clearly tied to \\nGermany. These plans eventually included invasions of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica based on \\nthe Germa n threat.

U.S. and \\nDanish representatives struck a treaty that was ratified by the U.S. Senate. The Danish \\nParliament, however, rejected it several months later .94 Many in the United States  at the time \\nsuspected  German pressure was to blame, a view which fed  the perception of a looming German \\nthreat. Nonetheless, further attempts were made until an agreement successfully made it through \\nboth U.S. and Danish legislatures in 1916.  \\n \\nGiven the longevity of U.S. inter est, acquisition of the Danish West Indies  was not exactly a \\ndirect or major consequence of the Spanish -American W ar. The navy was not even very \\ninvolved; the effort was run by the State Department. Insofar as the war played a role in \\nacquisition of the is lands, it was by contributing to a vision and desire for greater sea control.  \\n \\nFar more significant than the Danish West Indies , far more direct as a consequence of the war, \\nyet far more accidental , was the Panama Canal. Much of the naval strategy precedin g the war, as \\nwell as the immediate naval strategy around basing following the war, was premised on the \\ndesire and hope of an isthmian canal. Here domestic politics were flush with military strategy . \\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the building of a canal , though  three obstacles \\nremained before canal construction could take place: the renegotiation of a treaty with Britain \\n(prohibiting unilateral canal construction), resolving the t hreat of infectious  disease, and deciding \\nbetween Nicara gua and Panama as a route.   \\n \\nAfter the Spanish -American War , the British agreed to renegotiate the Clayton -Bulwer Treaty of \\n1850  that had established the principle of Anglo -American canal coordination.  This change in \\npolicy was part of a long -term strategi c focus  away from the Caribbean in British foreign policy. \\nTo the extent that this change was caused by the Spanish -American War is unknown, but the war  \\ncertainly encouraged it. The British were supportive of Americans in the war  and evaded \\nmaritime neutra lity laws in Hong Kong to allow  U.S. ships to repai r and transmit war -related \\nmessages. They also blocked a delivery of coal to the remaining Spanish squadron toward the \\nend of the conflict .95 The British further  indicated support for U.S. annexation of the Philippines. \\nThey clearly had no problem with U.S. expansionism in the Caribbean or in Asia.  \\n \\nWhat is more often missed is that, unintentionally, the Spanish -American War enabled canal \\nconstruction as a functio n of medical discovery . In addition to the engineering complexity, the \\ngreatest challenge of an isthmian canal was  the prevalence of  infectious disease. Yellow fever, \\nmalaria, and typhoid were major killers. It is estimated that over 20,000 laborers died d uring the \\nFrench  canal  effort in the 1880s  primarily from mudslides and disease .96 The same diseases were \\nalso a concern in Cuba  during  and after  the war .

Though theories of mosquito transmittal had surfaced \\nsince 1881  by Cuban physician Carlos Finlay , no definitive  causal link had yet been established  \\nbetween mosquitoes  and yellow fever . The consensus  at the time  was that yellow fever and \\nmalaria were transmitted through filth  or bacteria . After a few months of hypothesis testing, Dr. \\nWalter Reed ’s team proved th at a specific species of mosquito transmitted yellow fever , after \\nwhich they  developed methods to clear mosquitoes and  eradicate the disease . With this \\nknowledge, Major William C. Gorgas, chief sanitary officer in Havana, led a successful \\ncampaign to rid Havana of yellow fever. For the first time in two hund red years, in  October \\n1901, not a single case  of yellow fever  was reported.98 At around the same time, medical \\ndiscoveries were being made around malaria as well. In 1897, British doctor Ronald Ross \\nestablished that malaria was also transmitted by mosquito es. Gorgas’ work in Havana, thus, to \\nrid the city of mosquitoes, had the double effect of reducing incidence of malaria as well. From \\n1890 -1900, Havana reported 5,643 deaths from malaria. Between 1900 -1910, that number \\nplummeted to 444, and that was with a  larger and growing Havana population.99 \\n \\nThe consequences of these experiences were mammoth. Medical discoveries made during this \\ntime led to major organizational and educational reforms within the U.S. military, such as a \\npermanent  Army Nurse Corps, the Department of Military Hygiene at the U.S. Military \\nAcademy, and the Army Medical Reserve Corps. They ultimately led to compulsory anti -typhoid \\nvaccinations, stockpiles of medical supplies for future wars, and major advancements in \\nepidemiology and medical technology. They further led to the establishment of the Typhoid \\nFever Board, the Tropical Diseases Board, and the Yellow Fever Board.100 \\n \\nYears later , it was no coincidence that this same team , under (now) Colonel Gorgas,  was ordered \\nto study and w ork in  Panama.  Gorgas reflected, “We then built up much the same organization \\nhere that we had developed in Havana.”101 There is no question that had Ross or Reed failed to \\nfind an swers , the potential deaths from disease on the isthmus would have prohibited  U.S. \\nconstruction of a canal. It was well -known that Panama (and Nicaragua) presented the challenge \\nof infectious disease , given the French experience in the 1880s. To note, finding a solution to the \\nthreat in Cuba was not intended with canal construction  in mind. It was frankly the luck of \\ntiming  that Ross had discovered that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes in 1897, that Reed \\nproved Finlay’s hypothesis in 1900, and that McKinley picked the right people at the right time \\nto prove something that the medical community  did not believe . Without that, the political and \\nengineering preference between Nicaragua and Panama was moot.

After supporting the \\n1903 revolution in Panama to break free from Colombian colonial control, Roosevelt struck an \\nimbalanced treaty with the fledgling Panamanian government. The agreem ent gave the U.S. \\nvirtual sovereignty over the so -called Panama Canal Zone, which it fortified. Once open for \\nbusiness in 1914, the canal significantly cut global trading routes and gave the United States \\noversight over one of the busiest waterways in the world.  \\n \\nOther major medium and long -term changes involved  institutional reform across the army, navy, \\nand inter -service bodies.103 \\n \\nThe bungling of army mobilization  and training  for the war, among a few related issues of \\noversight, led to the resignation of Secretary of War Russell A. Alger  in 1899 . Upon taking \\nAlger’s place, Elihu Root introduced  a slew of reforms in army  organization. These included \\nmajor reforms of command structure, bureaucratic organization, and education. Root increased \\nthe size of t he army, established the Army War College in 1901, abolished permanent staff in \\nDC-based bureaus (which had become overly independent and powerful), and established greater \\ncivilian supremacy and accountability in leadership. In undertaking the last reform , he abolished \\nthe position of “General -in-Chief” (the most senior army general), to create transparency in the \\nchain of command; the relationship between the Secretary of War and the General -in-Chief had \\nbeen unclear. Instead, Root created the position of  Chief of Staff, to whom bureau chiefs \\nreported, and who advised the secretary with the help of 40 -50 officers in the new “General Staff \\nCorps ,” created in 1903.104 Two further bills, in 1903 and 1908, reformed the National Guard to \\nallow it to be mobilized to fight at home and abroad (during the Spanish -American War, militia \\nmembers served as volunteers).  \\n \\nAs alluded to above, the war rehabilitated the U.S. Army Sign al Corps from the Civil War era to \\nbecome a permanent and important fixture of the military. During the war, the corps’ role in \\nproviding intelligence on Spanish maritime activity and  in linking Guantánamo Bay and Ponce, \\nPuerto Rico to Washington by telegr aph was critical for the United States. General Shafter had \\nactually opted to leave electrical and telegraph equipment behind in Key West when he was \\nrequested to Santiago. This reflected the low status  and importance afford ed to the signal corps \\nin contem porary military doctrine. General Adolphus Greely, Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. \\nArmy, brought th e equipment  anyway, which eventually allowed Shafter to communicat e with \\nWashington within minutes. While the signal corps did make mistakes (a hot air ball oon \\nintended for surveillance in Santiago instead brought attention and revealed the U.S. position  to \\nthe enemy ), the Spanish -American War was a hinge point for signal corps history. Not only did \\nthe service expand and prove its importance for military cam paigns, intelligence gathering, \\ncommunications , and therefore sea control, it also was institutionalized with the opening of the \\nSignal School at Fort Leavenworth in 1906.105 \\n \\nThe U.S. Navy also reformed further , albeit less dra matically  than the army  did.

Proximity  \\n \\nThe United States borders the Caribbean while its 1898 opponent, Spain, was both far away and \\nspread across the world. China similarly borders the South China Sea, while its primary rival in \\nthe Asia  Pacific, the United States, is both far away and spread across the world.   \\n \\nImplicatio n for sea control:  Proximity makes sea control easier.  \\n \\n3. Multipolar, extra -hemispheric balance of power  \\n \\nIn 1898, neither the U.S. nor any other state dominated the Caribbean. Furthermore, some of the \\nstates that did have influence, like Spain, the Netherlands, France, and Great Britain, were \\ncolonial powers with territories within the region. Similarly, today, no state dominates the South \\nChina Sea. First, because Taiwan guards the gates to the Western Pacific via the Bashi Channel , \\nespecially important for submarines given its depth relative to the rest of the Luzon Strait .111 \\nTaiwan also lies between  the South and East China seas. Second, Indonesia and Malaysia \\noversee the main entrance from the west (and in Indonesia’s case, other entrances from the \\nsouth). Lastly,  like in 1898, partnerships and alliances  (like U.S. -Taiwan, U.S. -South Korea, \\nU.S.-Japan, and Five Eyes) add extra -hemispheric players into the region and its peripheries.  \\n \\nImplication for sea control:  Multipolar systems are more difficult to dominate.  \\n \\n4. Centralized leadership with party  strength and  longevity  \\n \\nIt may not be intuitive to draw a similarity between Xi Jinping, an authorita rian leader of a one-\\nparty system, and William McKinley, the democratically -elected leader of a two -party system. \\nMcKinley certainly faced greater popular constraints than Xi does now. However, McKinley also \\nserve d at a time of Republican dominance of the presidency (six of the prior eight elections had \\nbeen won by Republicans). Further, the congressional elections of 1894 – 2 years before \\nMcKinley came to office – led to Republican majorities in both houses, which  lasted another 17 \\nyears. McKinley thus stood at the helm of a unified government and enjoyed great freedom of \\naction. He empowered the office of the presidency and took bolder actions in foreign policy than \\nmost of his predecessors. Xi, as many scholars h ave observed, is the most powerful Chinese \\nleader since Mao Zedong.  \\n \\nImplication for sea control: Party alignment  and centralized leadership enable s leaders to have \\ngreater power in policymaking. This adds importance to the worldviews of McKinley and Xi \\nregarding  involvement in the region.  \\n \\n5.

Military and economic development  \\n \\nThe United States in 1898 and China today were and are experienc ing intense periods of military \\nand economic growth. While precise U.S. GDP estimates of the 1800s are unavailable, it is \\nwidely known that it experienced a massive industrial boom in the second half of the twentieth \\ncentury. As a rough metric, the value of U .S. manufacturing grew  by 7% on average from 1880 -\\n1900.112 Starting in the 1880s, this economic growth coincided with a modernization and \\nreinvestment campaign in the U.S. Navy  that yielded modern warships and a professionalization \\nof the service . Similarly , China has experience d an average of 9% growth in GDP over the last \\ntwenty years, with a matched growth in its military investment (although this also means military \\ninvestment has remained  a consistent percentage of GDP, at 1.9%).113 \\n \\nImplication for sea control:  A larger military and economy mean the barriers to deploying \\nforce are generally lower  (lost trade , an added cost and weakness,  is analyzed below under \\n‘differences’).  \\n \\n7. Trade as a strength  \\n \\nWhile trade forms a vastly different amount of China’s economy today than it did for the United \\nStates in 1898, both have (and had) the advantage of trade dependence of their neighbors. In \\n1898, many Caribbean countries (and Hawaii) were dependent on trade  with the United States. \\nChina is either the top or second most important trading partner with practically every country in \\nSoutheast Asia.  \\n \\nImplication for sea control:  As explored below, trade is also a vulnerability of China. But in the \\ncase of trade d ependence of its neighbors, if China can isolate specific neighbors, it minimizes \\nthe effect to its own economy while  it pressures others . In this way, it can use economic means to \\ncomplement military policy in achieving its goals in the South China Sea , which seems to be the \\ncase with  the Philippines .

Geography  \\n \\nFor the purposes of sea control, the  two greatest geological difference is that the Greater \\nCaribbean is bisected by several islands in the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, the \\nCayman Islands, and Puerto Rico)  and second, that there is a  canal . The  Greater Antilles present s \\nadded vectors of strategic control. The South China Sea has no such string of islands . China has \\nbegun developing the Spratlys and Paracels, of course, but those are more limited in what they \\ncan offer for sea control given their lac k of natural resources and size.115 As for the canal, while \\nthe Panama Canal was not built until well after the 1898 war, the prospect of an isthmian canal \\n(popular even before 1898) enabled U.S. decision -makers to envision a world where the United \\nStates d ominated the Caribbean basin.  \\n \\nImplication for sea control:  Fewer vectors of sea control in a water body as vast as the South \\nChina Sea impl y sea control is harder to execute. This fact places much more importance on the \\ncontrol of Taiwan, which oversees transit to the western Pacific  and the East China Sea . \\n \\n2. The neighborhood  \\n \\nChina today is surrounded by far more powerful and populous independent neighbors than the \\nUnited States was in 1898. Southeast Asia has a population amounting to roughly  650 million , \\nand China has  border disputes with almost every country in the region . This implies that those \\ncountries see China more as a threat than Caribbean countries did the United States in the  late \\n19th century . Further, Southeast Asian countries  have greater capacity to affect outcomes  and \\nhave outposts on the disputed islands (see Fig. 2 ).116 This especially  is the case given the U.S. \\nalliance with Taiwan. In 1898, Central American and Caribbean countries may not have \\nwelcomed greater U.S. influence, but relations were generally less antagonistic and those \\ncountries had less of an ability to protest. Colonial po wers  that did have influence, outside of \\nSpain, were either distracted by imperial rivalries elsewhere, welcomed U.S. influence, or were \\napathetic.

Stakes  \\n \\nConflict in the Caribbean in 1898 was a lower  stakes conflict than conflict in the South China \\nSea would be today for two primary reasons. First, in 1898, while the Panama Railroad had \\nlubricated transcontinental trade for several decades, no isthmian canal had yet been built. U.S. \\nstrategic interest in the Caribbean was more about prospective  economic importance and \\nsecurity .118 Such is not the case in the South China Sea, where, already, 21% of global trade \\ntravels through it.119 Thus, other regional powers, like India, Australia, Japan, and Korea, all  \\nhave a major stake in the security of the South China Sea.  Second, the potential for great power \\nwar in the Caribbean was significantly lower in 1898 than it is today in the South China Sea. No \\nimperial power in 1898 had warned the United States or threat ened involvement.  \\n \\nImplications for sea control:  Higher stakes d o not necessarily mean higher chance of conflict. \\nIt does mean that sea control is both more important to China, but also to the rest of the world. In \\nthat way it could equally be a restraint  as much as an enabler.  \\n \\n5. Trade as a weakness  \\n \\nWhen the United States intervened in Cuba in 1898, its trade with Cuba had already been wiped \\nout. Most of that trade was imported sugar, which the United States managed to replace by \\nimport ing more beet sugar from Germany and from domestic molasses and sugar production .120 \\nExports to Cuba, and trade in general, formed a small part of the U.S. economy. As noted above, \\nU.S. exports were less than 10% of the total value of U.S. manufacturing, imply ing that the U.S. \\ntrade -to-GDP ratio was even less than that.121 Moreover, at their very peak before the war in \\n1893, U.S. exports to Cuba represented just 2.8% of all exports, suggesting that exports to Cuba \\nwas a fraction of a percent of the total U.S. ec onomy. In waging war against Spain over Cuba, \\ntherefore, the United States was not risking much relative to its economy. The case with China is \\ndifferent. China’s trade -to-GDP ratio was 36%  in 2019 .122 Moreover, its exports to its \\nsurrounding region, and to  the United States, form a non -trivial amount of that trade.  \\n \\nImplication for sea control:  While trade disruption may not stop a country from going to war, it \\ncertainly increases the costs of doing so.   \\n \\n6. Relative ability to project maritime power  \\n \\nAt the turn of the century, the United States had few overseas territories.123 Moreover, by 1898, it \\nonly had half a dozen modern battleships at its disposal.

In 2012 (the most recent CINC data), it was 14.0% for the United \\nStates to China’s 21.8%.125 Additionally, the sheer size of the Chinese military, its impressive \\nfleet, and its drone and missile technology together enable greater Chinese control over its \\nenvironment and may deter outside powers from military engagement.126  \\n \\nImplications for sea control:  This differential heightens the cost of conflict for both China and \\nthe United States.  \\n \\nLearning from History:  \\nWhat to Draw from the 1898 Case  \\n \\nThe 1898 case and the South China Sea today share many similarities and many differences, all \\nwith implications for sea control. By their very nature, analogies are imperfect. The point of \\nanalyzing 1898 and the Caribbean is to study a case that share s the same broad outlines as the \\nthreat in the South China Sea: a rising power exercises force in a large, semi -enclosed sea and \\ngains immense maritime power as a consequence.  Such a study  will not provide a blueprint for \\ntoday’s world, but it will highlight and sharpen specific analytical elements of risk in the South \\nChina Sea. It can caution us to the potential futures, threats , and blind spots that are applicable to \\nthe South China Sea but were otherwise difficult to visualize  absent the analysis . \\n \\nAfter consideration of the many similarities and differences, a few points emerge. They are broad \\nand abstract enough to apply to a completely different region in a completely different  era, but \\nthey are also specific enough to be meaningful.  \\n \\nFirst, wars can be sticky. Though the United States did not declare war on Spain  to gain sea \\ncontrol, a few significant military acquisitions stuck. The United States began to value those sites \\nfar more than they did before the conflict. Manila Bay, for instance, was never a desire of the \\nUnited States, until it came into possession of it. Guantánamo is another example more relevant \\nto the Caribbean Sea. Had Cervera’s fleet not gone to Santiago, the Unite d States would not have \\nseized Guantánamo. Had that not happened, naval basing in Cuba might have looked very \\ndifferent. Given how successfully the Cubans managed to reject other U.S. Navy basing requests \\nafter the war, one wonders whether the United State s would have secured  any Cuban  bases had \\nCervera sailed to Puerto Rico, Cienfuegos, or Havana, instead of Santiago . For the South China \\nSea, this  tale is cautionary. It  means that Chinese victory in a conflict could lead to military \\nacquisition of territor y outside of established areas of interest  that also become especially \\ndifficult to wrest away afterward.  \\n \\nSecond, the ripeness of a conflict can open the gates to dormant political preferences . In 1898, \\npursuit of a canal and control of Puerto Rico were g ood examples of that. The United States \\nwanted more footholds in the Caribbean, as evidenced by the 1896 Republican Party platform \\nsupporting the purchase of the Danish West Indies .

Once the Spanish -American War was \\nunderway, however, Puerto Rico served a similar strategic purpose as acquisition of the Danish \\nWest Indies . It was a military necessity for the war; but it also f ulfilled a latent political desire  of \\na “much needed Naval Station in the West Indies,” as the 1896 party platform declared.127 \\n \\nMoreover, pursuit of a canal after the war was enabled  by territorial acquisitions  and unforeseen \\nmedical discoveries  in the  war. As applied to China  today , it has border disputes with almost \\nevery country in Southeast Asia.128 A conflict that is not started over border disputes , even one \\nstarted accidentally,  might still provide a window for expansionist policies to be enacted , like a \\nliquid taking the shape of its container.  \\n \\nThird, wars can set a precedent for a pattern of interaction. In the case of 1898, the United States \\ndid not normally engage in overseas war. Outside of scattered Frontier War campaigns against \\nNative Americans, its last foreign war was from 1846 -1848 against Mexico . Military clashes in \\nthe Caribbean were rare . Following the Spanish -American War  in 1898 , however, it spent the \\nnext several decades using military force in Latin America with great frequenc y. The Spanish -\\nAmerican War, in that way, normalized the use of force and occupation as a tool of statecraft in \\nthe neighborhood. China historically has engaged in more conflict with its neighbors than the \\nUnited States had in 1898. Still, the risk remains  that the use of violent force as a means to settle \\ndisputes in the South China Sea could normalize the policy.  To a lesser  degree, China has \\nalready tested this, for instance, by sinking a Vietnames e fishing vessel on April  3, 2020 near the \\nParacels.  \\n \\nFourth, countries can learn from conflict , even short ones . Though  the United States \\noverwhelmed the Spanish militarily, the war revealed many weaknesses of the U.S. military that \\nit would not have recognized  absent  testing in war. Professionalization of the  army, greater inter -\\nservice cooperation, and gunnery  innovations  were just a few of the ways in which the United \\nStates learned from the conflict.  In the short -term it also refocused U.S. naval strategy on base \\nacquisition and coaling stations.  Those chan ges had massive implications for the preparedness of \\nthe United States before World War I. A lower stakes conflict in the South China Sea (say, one \\nthat does not involve the United States) might test the Chinese military in a way that reveals \\nimportant wea knesses without undermining a Chinese victory. These learnings would strengthen \\nthe Chinese military for  a future higher  stakes conflict with a major power.  \\n \\nFifth, greater control and territory does not imply a greater feeling of security. This is evidenc ed \\nby the U.S. Navy’s scramble to request many more bases after the Spanish -American War and \\nthe intense amount of war planning against Germany. Despite greater objective control over \\nSLOCs in the Caribbean, if anything, ironically, the United States felt more vulnerable (this \\ncertainly was the case with the Philippines). German aggression and activities elsewhere in the \\nworld gave good reason to arouse suspicion. But a clear logistical assessment of how Germany \\nmight have  credibly f ought a Caribbean war (and, perhaps more importantly, why it might have \\ndone  so) were left to speculation.

However, g iven the politica l complexity of the  South China Sea  neighborhood , U.S. and \\nChinese nuclear power, the interest s of powerful U.S. partners in the region  and its periphery , \\nand the uncertainty of U.S. involvement in a conflict over Taiwan, it is difficult to imagine a \\nscenario largely like 1898 playing out – that is, an outward Chinese declaration of war on the \\nUnited States.  \\n \\nIt is also the case that it is more difficult for China to exercise sea control over the entire South \\nChina Sea than it was for the United States  to control the Caribbean  at the turn of the century.  \\nThis is partly due to the lack of resource -rich islands in the middle of the sea, as well as to the \\nfact that ships have alternative navigation options in, out, and around the sea, guarded by other \\ncountries. China’s military installations on the Spratlys and Paracels are now well -documented  \\nand certainly add an important layer  of Chinese sea control  throug h anti -ship and anti -aircraft \\nmissile systems , surveillance technology, and other port, land, and aviation facilities . Still, those \\nmilitary installations, though important, are not analogous to large bases on resource -rich islands \\nwith access to fresh wat er.130  \\n \\nWhile the Caribbean also has multiple entrances and exits  through the Lesser Antilles , the \\nconstruction of the Panama Canal (strategically and accidentally enabled by the 1898 war) \\ngreatly increase d U.S. dominance  by giving it exclusive control over a single choke point. The \\nclosest analogues to the canal  in the South China Sea  are the Bashi Channel connecting the South \\nChina Sea with the western Pacific (between Formosa and Luzon) and the Malacca Strait  \\n(between t he Malay Peninsula and Sumatra) . Those are immensely important as well, of course, \\nbut they are far more complex issues due to the presence of other powers (Malaysia, Indonesia, \\nthe Philippines, and Taiwan) and the availability of alternative (if less effi cient and more costly) \\noptions of transit  (see Fig. 5).131 \\n \\n \\n129 Ross (2002), p. 63.

For the \\nUnited States in 1898, it was a humanitarian catastrophe in Cuba. In 1891, a drunken street brawl \\nin Valparaiso, Chile between U.S. sailors and Chilean rebels brought the United States  and Chile \\nto the very brink of war.132 For China, it could be a fishing dispute, any altercation involving \\nChinese servicemembers (or citizens), or some other unforeseen political development in a \\ncountry with which it has a border disagreement. Given its frequent flyovers, exercises, military  \\ninstallation construction, and sinking of foreign vessels, the most concerning revelation is that \\nChina is also looking to create such sparks. Recently, no actions have escalated to a larger \\nconflict, but that cannot be  guaranteed  in perpetuity .  \\n \\nTo some  degree, this implies the United States is relatively powerless to affect outcomes. If \\nChina decides to spar with Indonesia over the waters around the Natuna Islands,  for instance,  it is \\nunlikely the United States would threaten military force  (though, in that case, Indonesia could \\nalso use the Strait of Malacca as leverage) . On the other hand, if the United States does nothing, \\nChina could continue its so -called salami tactics of slowly claiming parts of  the South China Sea \\nwithout ever risking U.S. involv ement.  And, of course, there is the looming question of \\nTaiwan.133  \\n \\nA key insight, however, is not about responding disproportionately to more minor disputes ; it is \\npreventing those disputes from becoming violent in the first place, and reducing the window  of \\nChina to claim more territory through conflict. One way of doing so is through continued \\nmilitary support of partners in the area , basing,134 and deterrence, though of course that strategy \\nrisks  spiraling and escalating tensions  – creating the very circumstances it might hope to prevent. \\nAnother is to gather regional nations and establish detailed and clear protocols  and contingency \\nplans for precisely the kinds of accidental sparks that risk escalat ion: collisions, damage, sink ing \\nof ships, downing of aircraft, and so forth.135 \\n \\nA complementary , though politically difficult,  option would be compromise. In 1898, had Spain \\nagreed to the minimum U.S. and Cuban rebel demands, it would have avoided conflict and the \\nUnited States would  have exited  the agreement with far less sea control  than it ended up having.  \\nWhile Cuba would have gained independence, Spain would have retained Puerto Rico, Guam, \\nand the Philippines . In the South China Sea, compromise could be anchored in the dispute i tself, \\nor “issue -linkage” could be employed to make concessions on unrelated disputes for the purpose \\nof avoiding conflict in the South China Sea.  Of course, as noted with U.S. threat assessment vis -\\nà-vis Germany after the Spanish -American War, a compromis e could also  increase the Chinese \\nfeeling of vulnerability.  Lastly, the United States could continue shoring up partnerships in and \\noutside  of the region to press China diplomaticall y through bilateral relations and international \\nfora.136 \\n \\n \\n132 See: Sater (1999).  \\n133 A recent strategic analysis of the Taiwan que stion encourages an approach that deters China by making \\ntransparent U.S. contingency plans of widened war over Taiwan.

Focus excessively on historical elements that \\nare not pertinent  to the contemporary case,  and applying history can do more harm than good. \\nMake too many historical caveats in the hope of sacrificing the lea st amount of context, or, \\nalternatively, generalize too much in the hope of broadening applicability , and the analytical \\nexercise loses meaning.  \\n \\nThe case of the United States, Spain, and the Caribbean in 1898 is undoubtedly different from \\nthat of China, t he United States, and the South China Sea today. But studying that historical case \\noffers another method of thinking about a problem  with some shared contours; another \\nframework for  reasoning through analytic questions. T he 1898 case deliver s some intuitio n about \\nthe salient and the subtle ways  rising states can gain sea control through conflict, the many \\nvariables at play, and, maybe mo st importantly, the ever -present element of uncertainty . Just \\nyears b efore the war, no reasonable individual thought the U nited States would soon control \\nPuerto Rico, Cuba, Guam, and the Philippines (though they might have guessed Hawaii). No one \\ncould have predicted the medical innovation the war led to and how that cleared the path for  a \\ncanal.   \\n \\nThat uncertainty under girds  the five major analytical points made in the last section about what \\nto draw from 1898: the stickiness  of acquisitions , enabling latent policy preferences, pattern -\\nsetting, learning from conflict, and the counterintuitive insecurity that comes from e xpansion. \\nThose are five points that suggest risks in the contemporary case, but they do not predict the \\nfuture, nor do they offer a specific blueprint. They do , however,  sharpen awareness of the many \\nanalytical variables of the South China Sea and they do  make us wise about the potential futures \\nthat could transpire.  \\n \\nChina could gain significantly from conflict in the South China Sea, territorially, logistically, \\ninstitutionally, and  tactically  by testing its military. It could gain more than anyone might  assume \\nfrom  its current  maritime disputes, even if the spark or conflict does not stem from sea control . \\nThat is one lesson of uncertainty  and the Spanish -American War . But China  would not \\nnecessarily gain if a major power like the United States is drawn in. Moreover, geographically, \\npolitically, militarily, and economically, China is constrained in many more ways than the \\nUnited States was in 1898. None of th e discussion  above  even touched  on the complex extra -\\nregional dynamics of India, Russia, Australia, and Northeast Asia.  \\n \\nA preferable outcome  to conflict in the South China Sea , if still troubling, is China’s status quo \\npolicy, slicing a piece of the proverbial salami that advances its position little by little, but also \\nthat never offend s a country enough for it to declare war.  Studying the Spanish -American War \\ndoes not deliver an easy solution to  that important policy question, except to caution against one \\nof the alternatives. China would gain most by a contained  bilateral conflict that mini mizes risk of \\na widen ed war  and maximizes its leverage and advantage over the single target state. Its gains \\nfrom such a conflict might last well into the future. In a sense, those were the general \\ncircumstances  and outcomes  of 1898 as well.  \\n  ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4260, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.08726814443420655)], metadata={'7e0daf75-a9cf-471b-a3fb-18fd8cc0d2f3': {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '1706.03762.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/ianjoyce/Desktop/RAG/content/1706.03762.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2215244, 'creation_date': '2024-02-06', 'last_modified_date': '2024-02-06', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-02-06'}, '980dd5da-1520-4357-8750-e64b58d251b9': {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1706.03762.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/ianjoyce/Desktop/RAG/content/1706.03762.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2215244, 'creation_date': '2024-02-06', 'last_modified_date': '2024-02-06', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-02-06'}})"
